      <title>On the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture for $p=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove some new cases of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture on two-dimensional Galois representations when $p=3$. Combining the previous work, we can conclude the conjecture in the regular case when $p$ is an odd prime. Our result is a sequel to Pan's work, based on some recent progress on $p$-adic Langlands correspondence and Galois deformation theory.</description>

      <title>Transcendence of ${}_3F_2(1)$ Hypergeometric Series and $L$-values of Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the families of hypergeometric series associated to a special class of modular hypergeometric Galois representations recently studied by Allen, Grove, Long, and Tu. The underlying motives allow us to express a special $L$-value of the corresponding modular form in terms of these hypergeometric series. We use extra symmetries coming from the underlying modular forms to study the transcendence of families of periods, which have the form ${}_3F_2(1)$, on hypergeometric surfaces. For several hypergeometric surfaces with four periods, we show that the vector space generated by these elements has dimension at most 2. As an application of our results, we utilize a classical formula of ${}_3F_2(1)$ series due to Kummer to find relations between $L$-values of modular forms that differ by an even twist, as predicted in a theorem of Shimura.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory and ranks of elliptic curves in quadratic twist families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of ranks of elliptic curves in quadratic twist families using Iwasawa-theoretic methods, contributing to the understanding of Goldfeld's conjecture. Given an elliptic curve $ E/\mathbb{Q} $ with good ordinary reduction at $ 2 $ and $ \lambda_2(E/\mathbb{Q}) = 0 $, we use Matsuno's Kida-type formula to construct quadratic twists $ E^{(d)} $ such that $ \lambda_2(E^{(d)}/\mathbb{Q}) $ remains unchanged or increases by $ 2 $. When the root number of $E^{(d)}$ is $-1$ and the Tate-Shafarevich group $Sha(E^{(d)}/\mathbb{Q})[2^\infty] $ is finite, this yields quadratic twists with Mordell--Weil rank $ 1 $. These results support the conjectural expectation that, on average, half of the quadratic twists in a family have rank $ 0 $ and half have rank $ 1 $. In the cases we consider we obtain asymptotic lower bounds for the number of twists by squarefree numbers $d\leq X$ which match with the conjectured value up to an explicit power of $\log X$.</description>

      <title>$\ell$-Torsion in Class Groups via Dirichlet $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $\ell$, let $h_\ell(K)$ denote the $\ell$-part of the class number of the number field $K$. We investigate upper bounds for $h_\ell(K)$ when $K$ is quadratic or cubic, particularly in the case in which the discriminant of $K$ is smooth. This is achieved using properties of Dirichlet $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Whittaker normalization of $p$-adic ABV-packets and Vogan's conjecture for tempered representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that ABV-packets for $p$-adic groups do not depend on the choice of a Whittaker datum, but the function from the ABV-packet to representations of the appropriate microlocal equivariant fundamental group does, and we find this dependence exactly. We study the relation between open parameters and tempered parameters and Arthur parameters and generic representations. We state a genericity conjecture for ABV-packets and prove this conjecture for quasi-split classical groups and their pure inner forms. Motivated by this we study ABV-packets for open parameters and prove that they are L-packets, and further that the function from the packet to the fundamental group given by normalized vanishing cycles coincides with the one given by the Langlands correspondence. From this conclude Vogan's conjecture on A-packets for tempered representations: ABV-packets for tempered parameters are Arthur packets and the function from the packet to the fundamental group given by normalized vanishing cycles coincides with the one given by Arthur.</description>

      <title>Pointwise ergodic theorems along fractional powers of primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish pointwise convergence for nonconventional ergodic averages taken along $\lfloor p^c\rfloor$, where $p$ is a prime number and $c\in(1,4/3)$ on $L^r$, $r\in(1,\infty)$. In fact, we consider averages along more general sequences $\lfloor h(p)\rfloor$, where $h$ belongs in a wide class of functions, the so-called $c$-regularly varying functions. We also establish uniform multiparameter oscillation estimates for our ergodic averages and the corresponding multiparameter pointwise ergodic theorem in the spirit of Dunford and Zygmund. A key ingredient of our approach are certain exponential sum estimates, which we also use for establishing a Waring-type result. Assuming that the Riemann zeta function has any zero-free strip upgrades our exponential sum estimates to polynomially saving ones and this makes a conditional result regarding the behavior of our ergodic averages on $L^1$ to not seem entirely out of reach.</description>

      <title>Theta correspondence via group C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the well-known explicit construction of the local theta correspondence by Li has a simple interpretation in terms of group C*-algebras. In particular, we deduce that in two standard cases where Li's method work, local theta correspondence arises from a continuous functor. Moreover, using results from a companion paper, we treat global theta correspondence using C*-algebraic methods. As a byproduct, we exhibit that Rallis inner product formula can be interpreted as a certain natural inclusion being an isometry.</description>

Abstract: For $a \neq 1$ and $p$ prime, we define numbers of the form $pa^2$ to be Square-Prime (SP) Numbers. For example, 75 = 3 $\cdot$ 25; 108 = 3 $\cdot$ 36; 45 = 5 $\cdot$ 9. These numbers are listed in the OEIS as A228056. We study the properties of these numbers, their distribution/density and also develop a few claims on their distribution/density. We rely on computer programs to verify some conjectures up to large numbers.</description>

      <title>The Localization Method Applied to $k$-Elongated Plane Partitions and Divisibility by 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enumeration $d_k(n)$ of $k$-elongated plane partition diamonds has emerged as a generalization of the classical integer partition function $p(n)$. We have discovered an infinite congruence family for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 5. Classical methods cannot be used to prove this family of congruences. Indeed, the proof employs the recently developed localization method, and utilizes a striking internal algebraic structure which has not yet been seen in the proof of any congruence family. We believe that this discovery poses important implications on future work in partition congruences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical system generated by the iterated calculation of the high order gaps between neighboring terms of a sequence of natural numbers is remarkable and only incidentally characterized at the boundary by the notable Proth-Glibreath Conjecture for prime numbers.
  We introduce a natural extension of the original triangular arrangement, obtaining a growing hexagonal covering of the plane. This is just the base level of what further becomes an endless discrete helicoidal surface. % Although the repeated calculation of higher-order gaps causes the numbers that generate the helicoidal surface to decrease, there is no guarantee, and most often it does not even happen, that the levels of the helicoid have any regularity, at least at the bottom levels.
  However, we prove that there exists a large and nontrivial class of sequences with the property that their helicoids have all levels coinciding with their base levels. This class includes in particular many ultimately binary sequences with a special header. % For almost all of these sequences, we additionally show that although the patterns generated by them seem to fall somewhere between ordered and disordered, exhibiting fractal-like and random qualities at the same time, the distribution of zero and non-zero numbers at the base level has uniformity characteristics. Thus, we prove that a multitude of straight lines that traverse the patterns encounter zero and non-zero numbers in almost equal proportions.</description>

Abstract: We use the weighted version of the arithmetic-mean-geometric-mean inequality to motivate new results about Zaremba's function, $z(n) = \sum_{d|n} \frac{\log d}{d}$. We investigate record-setting values for $z(n)$ and the related function $v(n) = \frac{z(n)}{\log \tau(n)}$ where $\tau(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. We show that $v(n)$ takes on a maximum value and we give a list of all record-setting values for$v(n)$. Closely connected inequalities motivate the study of numbers which are pseudoperfect in a strong sense.</description>

      <title>Rational distances from given rational points in the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study sets of points in the plane with rational distances from r prescribed points P_1, ...,P_r. A crucial case arises for r = 3, where we provide simple necessary and sufficient conditions for the density of this set in the real topology. We show in the Main Theorem that these conditions can be checked effectively (via congruences), proving that a related class of K3 surfaces satisfies the local-global principle. In particular, these conditions are always satisfied when P_1, P_2, P_3 are rational. This result completes and goes beyond the analysis of Berry, who worked under stronger assumptions, not always fulfilled for instance in all the cases where P_1, P_2, P_3 are rational. On the other hand, for r\ge 4, we show that points with rational distances correspond to rational points in a surface of general type, hence conjecturally not Zariski dense. However, at the present, we lack methods to prove this, given the fact that the surface is simply-connected, as we shall show. We give explicit proofs as well as describe in detail the geometry of the surfaces involved. In addition we discuss certain analogues for points with distances in certain ring of integers.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field with $q$ elements, $F:=\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ and $F^{\operatorname{sep}}$ a separable closure of $F$. Set $A$ to denote the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a non-zero prime ideal of $A$, and $\mathscr{O}$ be the completion of $A$ at $\mathfrak{p}$. Given any integer $r\geq 2$, I construct a Galois representation $\rho:\operatorname{Gal}(F^{\operatorname{sep}}/F)\rightarrow \operatorname{GL}_r(\mathscr{O})$ which is unramified at all non-zero primes $\mathfrak{l}\neq \mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, and whose image is a finite index subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}_r(\mathscr{O})$. Moreover, if the degree of $\mathfrak{p}$ is $1$, then $\rho$ is also unramified at $\infty$.</description>

      <title>Approximation measures for shifted logarithms of algebraic numbers via effective Poincare-Perron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show new effective approximation measures for the shifted logarithm of algebraic numbers which belong to a number field of arbitrary degree. Our measures refine previous ones including those for usual logarithms. We adapt Pade approximants constructed by M. Kawashima and A. Poels in the rational case. Our key ingredient relies on the Poincare-Perron theorem which gives us asymptotic estimates at every archimedean place of the number field, that we apply to decide whether the shifted logarithm lies outside of the number field. We use Perron's second theorem and its modification due to M. Pituk to handle general cases.</description>

      <title>A finiteness condition for complex continued fraction algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is desirable that a given continued fraction algorithm is simple in the sense that the possible representations can be characterized in an easy way. In this context the so-called finite range condition plays a prominent role. We show that this condition holds for complex $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-Hurwitz algorithms with parameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in\mathbb{Q}^2$. This is equivalent to the existence of certain finite partitions related to these algorithms and lies at the root of explorations into their Diophantine properties. Our result provides a partial answer to a recent question formulated by Lukyanenko and Vandehey.</description>

      <title>The Shintani--Faddeev modular cocycle: Stark units from $q$-Pochhammer ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new interpretation of Stark units associated to real quadratic fields as real multiplication values of a modular cocycle. The cocycle of interest is a meromorphic factor describing the modular transformations of the $q$-Pochhammer symbol and is related to the Shintani--Barnes double sine function and the Faddeev quantum dilogarithm. We prove a refinement of Shintani's Kronecker limit formula that relates square roots of Stark class invariants to real multiplication values of the cocycle, which are cohomological invariants.</description>

      <title>Relative Lonely Runner spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a subtorus $T \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$, let $D(T)$ denote the $L^\infty$-distance from $T$ to the point $(1/2, \ldots, 1/2)$. For a subtorus $U \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$, define $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$, the Lonely Runner spectrum relative to $U$, to be the set of all values of $D(T)$ as $T$ ranges over the $1$-dimensional subtori of $U$ not contained in the union of the coordinate hyperplanes of $(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$. The relative spectrum $\mathcal{S}_1((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n)$ is the ordinary Lonely Runner spectrum that has been studied previously.
  Giri and the second author recently showed that the relative spectra $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$ for $2$-dimensional subtori $U \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$ essentially govern the accumulation points of the Lonely Runner spectrum $\mathcal{S}_1((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n)$. In the present work, we prove that such relative spectra $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$ have a very rigid arithmetic structure, and that one can explicitly find a complete characterization of each such relative spectrum with a finite calculation; carrying out this calculation for a few specific examples sheds light on previous constructions in the literature on the Lonely Runner Problem.</description>

      <title>Triple sums of Kloosterman sums and the discrepancy of modular inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of modular inverses modulo positive integers $c$ in a large interval. We provide upper and lower bounds for their box, ball and isotropic discrepancy, thereby exhibiting some deviations from random point sets. The analysis is based, among other things, on a new bound for a triple sum of Kloosterman sums.</description>

      <title>Construction of simple quotients of Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives and highest derivative multisegments I: reduction to combinatorics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13286v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a local non-Archimedean field. A sequence of derivatives of generalized Steinberg representations can be used to construct simple quotients of Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$. In the first of a series of articles, we introduce a notion of a highest derivative multisegment, which in turn gives a combinatorial approach to study problems about those simple quotients. We also prove a double derivative result along the way.</description>

      <title>Dual of the Geometric Lemma and the Second Adjointness Theorem for $p$-adic reductive groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P,Q$ be standard parabolic subgroups of a $p$-adic reductive group $G$. We study the smooth dual of the filtration on a parabolically induced module arising from the geometric lemma associated to the cosets $P\setminus G/Q$. We prove that the dual filtration coincides with the filtration associated to the cosets $P\setminus G/Q^-$ via the Bernstein-Casselman canonical pairing from the second adjointness of parabolic induction. This result generalizes a result of Bezrukavnikov-Kazhdan on the explicit description in the second adjointness. Along the way, we also study some group theoretic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Burde--de Rham theorem for finitely presented pro-$p$ groups under the assumption that the total degrees of all relators are $0$. We also give some concrete examples including higher-dimensional cases under Iwasawa theoretic conditions, and consider some cohomological interpretations.</description>

      <title>The multilinear circle method and a question of Bergelson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb Z_+$ and $(X, \mathcal B(X), \mu)$ be a probability space equipped with a family of commuting invertible measure-preserving transformations $T_1,\ldots, T_k \colon X\to X$. Let $P_1,\ldots, P_k\in\mathbb Z[\rm n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees. We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages \[A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, \]
  as $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture.
  In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theorem for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</description>
