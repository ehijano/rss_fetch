      <title>Random walk models of anisotropic diffusion on rectangular and hexagonal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusive transport of particles in anisotropic media is a fundamental phenomenon in computational, medical and biological disciplines. While deterministic models (partial differential equations) of such processes are well established, their inability to capture inherent randomness, and the assumption of a large number of particles, hinders their applicability. To address these issues, we present several equivalent (discrete-space discrete-time) random walk models of diffusion described by a spatially-invariant tensor on a two-dimensional domain with no-flux boundary conditions. Our approach involves discretising the deterministic model in space and time to give a homogeneous Markov chain governing particle movement between (spatial) lattice sites over time. The spatial discretisation is carried out using a vertex-centred element-based finite volume method on rectangular and hexagonal lattices, and a forward Euler discretisation in time yields a nearest-neighbour random walk model with simple analytical expressions for the transition probabilities. For each lattice configuration, analysis of these expressions yields constraints on the time step duration, spatial steps and diffusion tensor to ensure the probabilities are between zero and one. We find that model implementation on a rectangular lattice can be achieved with a constraint on the diffusion tensor, whereas a hexagonal lattice overcomes this limitation (no restrictions on the diffusion tensor). Overall, the results demonstrate good visual and quantitative (mean-squared error) agreement between the deterministic model and random walk simulations for several test cases. All results are obtained using MATLAB code available on GitHub (https://github.com/lukefilippini/Filippini2025).</description>

      <title>Constrained bilinear optimal control of reactive evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider constrained bilinear optimal control of second-order linear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reaction term on the half line, where control arises as a time-dependent reaction coefficient and constraints are imposed on the state and control variables. These PDEs represent a wide range of physical phenomena in fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer. Existing computational methods for this type of control problems only consider constraints on control variables. In this paper, we propose a novel optimize-then-discretize framework for computing constrained bilinear optimal control with both state and control constraints. Unlike existing methods that derive optimality conditions directly from the PDE constraint, this framework first replaces the PDE constraint with an equivalent integral representation of the PDE solution. The integral representation, derived from the unified transform method, does not involve differential operators, and thus explicit expressions for necessary conditions of optimality can be derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for infinite-dimensional optimization. Discretizing the optimality conditions results in a system of finite-dimensional smooth nonlinear equations, which can be efficiently solved using existing solvers without the need for specialized algorithms. This is in contrast with discretize-then-optimize methods that discretize the PDE first and then solve the optimality conditions of the approximated finite-dimensional problem. Computational results for two applications, namely nuclear reactivity control and water quality treatment in a reactor, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Towards In-Situ Failure Assessment: Deep Learning on DIC Results for Laminated Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting fracture load in laminated composites with stress raisers is challenging due to complex failure mechanisms such as delamination, fibre breakage, and matrix cracking, which are heavily influenced by fibre orientation, layup sequence, and notch geometry. This study aims to address this by developing a novel deep learning framework that leverages solely experimental strain field data from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for accurate, in-situ predictions--bypassing the need for finite element simulations or empirical calibrations. Two complementary architectures are explored: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that processes numerical values of maximum principal strain from a targeted rectangular region ahead of the notch, enhanced by advanced feature selection (mutual information, Lasso, and SHAP) to focus on critical data points; and a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on full-field strain images, bolstered by data augmentation to handle variability and prevent overfitting. Validated across 116 quasi-static tests encompassing 31 distinct configurations--including six layups (quasi-isotropic to highly anisotropic) with four off-axis angles for open-hole specimens, and one cross-ply layup with four off-axis and four on-axis notch orientations for U-notched specimens--the MLP and CNN achieve coefficients of determination (R^2) of 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. This framework captures a broad spectrum of damage modes and responses, from brittle fibre-dominated fracture to ductile delamination-driven failure, and due to its computational efficiency and reliance only on DIC measurements, the approach enables practical in-situ fracture load estimation.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Informed Method of Lines for Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid solver that fuses the dimensionality-reduction strengths of the Method of Lines (MOL) with the flexibility of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Instead of approximating spatial derivatives with fixed finite-difference stencils - whose truncation errors force extremely fine meshes - our method trains a neural network to represent the initial spatial profile and then employs automatic differentiation to obtain spectrally accurate gradients at arbitrary nodes. These high-fidelity derivatives define the right-hand side of the MOL-generated ordinary-differential system, and time integration is replaced with a secondary temporal PINN while spatial accuracy is retained without mesh refinement. The resulting "boundary-informed MOL-PINN" matches or surpasses conventional MOL in accuracy using an order of magnitude fewer collocation points, thereby shrinking memory footprints, lessening dependence on large data sets, and increasing complexity robustness. Because it relies only on automatic differentiation and standard optimizers, the framework extends naturally to linear and nonlinear PDEs in any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of $\textit{Less In More Out}$: modeling fabric-based soft robotic hearts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabric-based soft robots combine high load-carrying capacity, efficiency, and low weight with the ability to bend, twist, contract, or extend with ease, making them promising candidates for biomedical applications such as soft total artificial hearts. While recent experiments have demonstrated their potential, predictive numerical models are urgently needed to study their complex mechanics, guide design optimization and improve their reliability. We develop a computational model of the Less In More Out device, a fluidically actuated soft total artificial heart constructed from heat-sealed layers of woven fabric. Our model reproduces the nonlinear deformation, strain fields, and pressure-volume relationships measured in quasi-static experiments. Devices with fewer pouches deliver higher stroke volumes but exhibit up to 50% higher peak von Mises stresses. Fatigue analysis using a strain-life approach identifies heat-sealed seams and buckling regions as durability-limiting features. Our framework enables detailed evaluation of stress concentrations, buckling, and fatigue life, providing mechanistic insights that are difficult to obtain experimentally. It also offers a foundation for the optimization of artificial hearts and other fluid actuated fabric-based soft robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Fast spectral separation method for kinetic equation with anisotropic non-stationary collision operator retaining micro-model fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized, data-driven collisional operator for one-component plasmas, learned from molecular dynamics simulations, to extend the collisional kinetic model beyond the weakly coupled regime. The proposed operator features an anisotropic, non-stationary collision kernel that accounts for particle correlations typically neglected in classical Landau formulations. To enable efficient numerical evaluation, we develop a fast spectral separation method that represents the kernel as a low-rank tensor product of univariate basis functions. This formulation admits an $O(N \log N)$ algorithm via fast Fourier transforms and preserves key physical properties, including discrete conservation laws and the H-theorem, through a structure-preserving central difference discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model accurately captures plasma dynamics in the moderately coupled regime beyond the standard Landau model while maintaining high computational efficiency and structure-preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Cluster percolation and dynamical scaling in the Baxter--Wu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the percolation behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn--type clusters in the spin-$1/2$ Baxter--Wu model with three-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. The considered clusters are constructed by randomly freezing one of the three sublattices, resulting in effective pairwise interactions among the remaining spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine the percolation temperature of these stochastic clusters and show that it coincides with the exact thermal critical point of the model. The critical exponents derived from cluster observables are consistent with those of the underlying thermal phase transition. Finally, we analyze the dynamical scaling of the multi-cluster and single-cluster algorithms resulting from the cluster construction, highlighting their efficiency and scaling behavior with system size.</description>

      <title>Automotive Crash Dynamics Modeling Accelerated with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon-hydrogen system is of key interest for solar-cell devices, including both crystalline and amorphous modifications. Elemental amorphous Si is now well understood, but the atomic-scale effects of hydrogenating the silicon matrix remain to be fully explored. Here, we present a machine-learned interatomic potential model based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework that can describe a wide range of Si-H phases, from crystalline and amorphous bulk structures to surfaces and molecules. We perform numerical and physical validation across a range of hydrogen concentrations and compare our results to experimental findings. Our work constitutes an advancement toward the exploration of large structural models of a-Si:H at realistic device scales.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for PDE-based Inverse Problems using the Optimization of a Discrete Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are crucial for many applications in science, engineering and medicine that involve data assimilation, design, and imaging. Their solution infers the parameters or latent states of a complex system from noisy data and partially observable processes. When measurements are an incomplete or indirect view of the system, additional knowledge is required to accurately solve the inverse problem. Adopting a physical model of the system in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a potent method to close this gap. In particular, the method of optimizing a discrete loss (ODIL) has shown great potential in terms of robustness and computational cost. In this work, we introduce B-ODIL, a Bayesian extension of ODIL, that integrates the PDE loss of ODIL as prior knowledge and combines it with a likelihood describing the data. B-ODIL employs a Bayesian formulation of PDE-based inverse problems to infer solutions with quantified uncertainties. We demonstrate the capabilities of B-ODIL in a series of synthetic benchmarks involving PDEs in one, two, and three dimensions. We showcase the application of B-ODIL in estimating tumor concentration and its uncertainty in a patient's brain from MRI scans using a three-dimensional tumor growth model.</description>

      <title>Globalizing the Carleman linear embedding method for nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carleman embedding method is a widely used technique for linearizing a system of nonlinear differential equations, but fails to converge in regions where there are multiple fixed points. We propose and test three different versions of a global piecewise Carleman embedding technique, based on partitioning space into multiple regions where the center and size of the embedding region are chosen to control convergence. The first method switches between local linearization regions of fixed size once the trajectory reaches the boundary of the current linearization chart. During the transition, the embedding is reconstructed within the newly created chart, centered at the transition point. The second method also adapts the chart size dynamically, enhancing accuracy in regions where multiple fixed points are located. The third method partitions the state space using a static grid with precomputed linearization charts of fixed size, making it more suitable for applications that require high speed. All techniques are numerically tested on multiple integrable and chaotic nonlinear dynamical systems demonstrating their applicability for problems that are completely intractable for the standard Carleman embedding method. Simulations of chaotic dynamical systems such as various types of strange attractors demonstrate the power of the adaptive methods, if a sufficiently low tolerance is imposed. Still, the non-adaptive version of the method, with fixed centers and sizes of the linearization charts, can be faster in simulating dynamical systems while providing similar accuracy and may be more appropriate as the basis of algorithms for future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A HHO formulation for variable density incompressible flows where the density is purely advected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with variable density that provides exact conservation of volume and, accordingly, pure advection of the density variable. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity-density-pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited for the simulation of mixtures of immiscible incompressible fluids, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of volume enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the convection dominated regime thanks to upwind stabilizations, weak imposition of boundary conditions, implicit high-order accurate time stepping encompassing unsteady boundary conditions, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. Numerical validation is performed showcasing convergence rates, pressure-robustness and pure advection of the density, thus we tackle the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at Reynolds $1~000$ and $5~000$.</description>

      <title>Aiming for Proxima Centauri b: Gravitational effects on relativistic spacecraft trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How important are gravitational and relativistic effects for interstellar travel? We consider this question in the context of proposed laser-propelled spacecraft missions to neighboring stellar destinations. Our analysis applies to any spacecraft traveling at relativistic speeds. As a concrete example, we focus on a mission to Proxima Centauri b -- a terrestrial-sized planet in the habitable zone around our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri. We employ a Julia reimplementation of the PoMiN code, an N-body code modeling relativistic gravitational dynamics in the first post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation to general relativity (valid to linear order in Newton's constant $G$). We compute the gravitational influence of seven different celestial bodies and find that the Sun has the greatest influence on the trajectory of the interstellar spacecraft. We also study the differences between Newtonian and PM gravity, and find that if mission planners wish to hit Proxima Centauri b with an accuracy of better than about 690,000 kilometers, relativistic effects must be taken into account. To solve for the precise initial data needed to hit an intended target, we develop numerical fine-tuning methods and demonstrate that these methods can (within a given model) be precise to about a femtometer over a travel distance of $\sim4.25$ light years. However, we find that for the spacecraft trajectories we consider, higher order general relativistic effects (beyond the first PM approximation) from the Sun can displace the final position of the spacecraft by tens of kilometers. We also consider the variation in the initial direction of the spacecraft velocity and find that, even with relativistic effects properly taken into account, the miss distances can be dominated by the variation in the initial velocity that could arise from errors during the launch and boost phase of the spacecraft mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of complex quantum systems remains a central challenge due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space with system size. Tensor network methods have long been established as powerful approximation schemes, and their efficiency can be further enhanced by incorporating physics-informed priors. A prominent example is symmetry: recent progress on $U(1)$-symmetric tensor networks, accelerated on GPUs and scaled to supercomputers, shows how conserved charges induce block-sparse structures that reduce computational cost and enable larger simulations. The same principle extends to general symmetries, inspiring equivariant neural networks in machine learning and guiding symmetry-preserving ansatze in variational quantum algorithms. Beyond symmetry, physics-informed design also includes strategies such as hybrid tensor networks and parallel sequential circuits, which pursue efficiency from complementary principles. This Perspective argues that physics-informed tensor networks, grounded in both symmetry and beyond-symmetry insights, provide unifying strategies for scalable approaches in quantum simulation, computation, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>On the new and accurate (Goudsmit-Saunderson) model for describing e-/e+ multiple Coulomb scattering (Geant4 Technical Note)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new model, for the accurate simulation of multiple Coulomb scattering (MSC) of e-/e+, has been implemented in Geant4 recently and made available with version Geant4-10.4. The model is based on Goudsmit-Saunderson (GS) angular distributions computed by utilising the screen Rutherford (SR) DCS and follows very closely the formulation developed by Kawrakow [1, 2] and utilised in the EGSnrc toolkit [3]. Corrections, for taking into accountenergy loss [2] neglected by the GS theory, spin-relativistic effects [3] not included in the SR but might be accounted on the basis of Mott DCS as well as the so-called scattering power correction [4], i.e. appropriately incorporating deflections due to sub-threshold delta ray productions, are all included similarly to the EGSnrc model [3]. Furthermore, an accurate electron-step algorithm [5, 6, 2] is utilised for path length correction, i.e. for calculating the post-step position in each condensed history simulation steps such that the corresponding single-scattering longitudinal and lateral (post step point) distributions are very well reproduced. An e-/e+ stepping algorithm, including the simulation step-limit due to the MSC and boundary crossing [2]), free from step-size artefacts, makes the model complete. Details on this new model, including all the above-mentioned components and corrections, are provided in this Geant4 technical note.
  It must be noted, that a Goudsmit-Saunderson model for MSC was available before Geant4-10.4., documented in [7], that has been completely replaced by the model described in this technical note (keeping only the G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel name of the C++ class from that previous version)</description>

      <title>Real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient framework for real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Anti-Interference Communication Using Computational Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel anti-interference communication method leveraging computational antennas, utilizing time averaging and 1-bit reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to achieve robust signal modulation with minimal hardware complexity. We develop a communication model for computational antennas and propose an efficient signal processing algorithm optimized for temporal modulation. A USRP-based experimental platform is established to validate the approach under strong interference conditions (e.g., 5 dB jamming-to-signal ratio). Experimental results reveal up to an 80.9\% reduction in bit error rate (BER) and effective restoration of distorted images in transmission tests. Compared to conventional techniques like spread spectrum or frequency hopping, which require significant spectral resources, our method offers superior anti-interference performance without additional spectral overhead. This research provides valuable insights for radar detection, military communications, and next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity deficit reduction via finite nuclear size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. The decay rate dependence on the $^{26m}$Al charge radius is found to be four times higher than previously believed, necessitating precise determination. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|$.</description>

      <title>Scattering modeling by a nonlinear slab: exact solution of the full vector problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of light by a nonlinear, anisotropic slab under conical incidence and arbitrary polarization, within the framework of Maxwell's equations, where the nonlinearities are described by nonlinear susceptibility tensors. We develop a fully tensorial numerical method, free from standard simplifications such as the undepleted pump approximation or scalar field assumptions, based on an iterative scheme where each step is solved via the finite element method. The two-dimensional problem is reduced to one dimension by exploiting symmetry arguments. Energy considerations are also addressed. Several numerical experiments involving a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) slab and a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) photonic crystal are presented, including cases with incident TE and TM waves, as well as a rotation-based study highlighting the anisotropic capabilities of our numerical model. This work provides a practical and general tool to help the optics research community overcome the limitations of existing models. It may facilitate the design of more advanced experiments to test nonlinear optical theories or improve nonlinear devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scotogenic Parameter Spaces and Mapping Uncharted Dark Matter Phenomenology with Multi-Objective Search Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel artificial intelligence approach to explore beyond Standard Model parameter spaces by leveraging a multi-objective optimisation algorithm. We apply this methodology to a non-minimal scotogenic model which is constrained by Higgs mass, anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, dark matter relic density, dark matter direct detection, neutrino masses and mixing, and lepton flavour violating processes. Our results successfully expand on the phenomenological realisations presented in previous work. We compare between multi- and single-objective algorithms and we observe more phenomenologically diverse solutions and an improved search capacity coming from the former. We use novelty detection to further explore sparsely populated regions of phenomenological interest. These results suggest a powerful search strategy that combines the global exploration of multi-objective optimisation with the exploitation of single-objective optimisation.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the Ti-V Phase Diagram Using First-Principles Calculations and Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V) binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this disagreement, we use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential with Bayesian inference of free energy surface. This workflow enables construction of the Ti-V phase diagram across the full composition range with systematically reduced statistical and finite-size errors. The resulting diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because our simulations model a perfectly oxygen-free Ti-V system, the observed gap cannot originate from impurity effects, in contrast to recent CALPHAD reassessments.</description>

      <title>Ab initio density functional theory approach to warm dense hydrogen: from density response to electronic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.</description>

      <title>Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), especially pre-trained foundation models, are transforming computational materials science by enabling ab initio-level accuracy at molecular dynamics scales. Yet their rapid rise raises a key question: should researchers train specialist models from scratch, fine-tune generalist foundation models, or use hybrid approaches? The trade-offs in data efficiency, accuracy, cost, and robustness to out-of-distribution failure remain unclear. We introduce a benchmarking framework using defect migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band trajectories, as diagnostic probes that test both interpolation and extrapolation. Using Cr-doped Sb2Te3 as a representative two-dimensional material, we benchmark multiple training paradigms within the MACE architecture across equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. Fine-tuned models substantially outperform from-scratch and zero-shot approaches for kinetic properties but show partial loss of long-range physics. Representational analysis reveals distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings, indicating that different training strategies learn different aspects of system physics. This framework provides practical guidelines for MLFF development and establishes migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics linking performance to learned representations, guiding future uncertainty-aware active learning.</description>

      <title>Neural Transformer Backflow for Solving Momentum-Resolved Ground States of Strongly Correlated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials host a rich variety of exotic quantum phases but remain challenging to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce the Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB) framework, a powerful neural-network ansatz formulated within a multi-band projection formalism. NTB is mean-field transcendental, parameter-efficient and fermionic intrinsic, exhibiting superior performance compared with existing neural ansatzes. By naturally enforcing momentum conservation, NTB enables direct computation of momentum-resolved many-body ground states, providing detailed access to degeneracies and energy gaps. It achieves high accuracy on small systems and scales efficiently to larger sizes and higher-band truncations far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. We demonstrate the power of NTB in capturing diverse correlated phases in twisted MoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. This approach offers a generic, scalable route towards understanding and discovering quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Ultrasonic Weld Characterization Using Hierarchical Wave Modeling and Diffusion-Driven Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings (resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</description>
