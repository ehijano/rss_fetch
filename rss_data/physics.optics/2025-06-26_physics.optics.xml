      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that electromagnetic constitutive relations of materials, defined by a scalar permittivity, $\varepsilon$, and permeability, $\mu$, are the same for all inertial observers provided that $\varepsilon\mu = 1$ is satisfied. To highlight the practical power of our general result, we discuss schemes in which this property plays a significant role, such as Fresnel-Fizeau optical drag or modified Snell's law for moving dielectrics. We also proof that such a particular behavior can be extended to systems like uniaxial anisotropic media or negative refractive index metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training for Optical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive optical information processors have demonstrated significant promise in delivering high-speed, parallel, and energy efficient inference for scaling machine learning tasks. Training, however, remains a major computational bottleneck, compounded by large datasets and many simulations required for state-of-the-art classification models. The underlying linear transformations in such systems are inherently constrained to compositions of circulant and diagonal matrix factors, representing free-space propagation and phase and/or amplitude modulation of light, respectively. While theoretically established that an arbitrary linear transformation can be generated by such factors, only upper bounds on the number of factors exist, which are experimentally unfeasible. Additionally, physical parameters such as inter-layer distance, number of layers, and phase-only modulation further restrict the solution space. Without tractable analytical decompositions, prior works have implemented various constrained minimization techniques. As trainable elements occupy a small subset of the overall transformation, existing techniques incur unnecessary computational overhead, limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate significant reduction in training time by exploiting the structured and sparse nature of diffractive systems in training and inference. We introduce a novel backpropagation algorithm that incorporates plane wave decomposition via the Fourier transform, computing gradients across all trainable elements in a given layer simultaneously, using only change-of-basis and element wise multiplication. Given the lack of a closed-form mathematical decomposition for realizable optical architectures, this approach is not only valuable for machine learning tasks but broadly applicable for the generation of arbitrary linear transformations, wavefront shaping, and other signal processing tasks.</description>

      <title>All-Dielectric Metasurface with a Two-Dimensional Locally Flat Photonic Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic flatbands offer promising light-matter interaction due to their unique slow-light nature. In recent years, flatbands have also attracted significant interest in optical engineering because of their angle-insensitive resonant characteristics. However, most photonic flatbands demonstrated to date occur only in one dimension and for a specific polarization, limiting their applicability. To date, no studies have reported the dispersionless behavior of flatbands under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles. Here, we present a two-dimensional photonic flatband created using a silicon metasurface with a Lieb lattice structure which demonstrates a locally flat photonic band for both TE- and TM- polarized light. Employing Fourier imaging, we analyze its energy-momentum dispersion under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles, demonstrating dispersionless flatbands up to +/-60{\deg} or +/-10{\deg}, depending on the polarization state and incident angle. This geometry is adaptable for applications in local field enhancement, enhanced photodetection, and augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Unconventional high-harmonic generation in resonant membrane metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has rapidly emerged as a promising platform for creating compact attosecond sources and probing ultrafast electron dynamics. Resonant metasurfaces are essential for enhancement of the otherwise small harmonic generation efficiency through local field enhancement and are essential to circumvent the need of phase matching constraints. Until now, the metasurface-enhanced HHG was believed to follow the conventional integer-power scaling laws that hold for non-resonant bulk HHG. Here, we discover that highly resonant metasurfaces driven by quasi-bound states in the continuum break this principle, manifesting non-integer intensity dependencies of the generated harmonic powers. We show experimentally and theoretically that these unconventional nonlinearities arise from the high-Q resonances that generate local fields strong enough to substantially alter the contribution of higher order susceptibility tensors to the effective nonlinearities of the system. Our findings reveal how harmonic generation rooted in resonant field-driven modification of effective nonlinear susceptibilities can reshape our understanding of light-matter interaction at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Dual Synchronization Effects in Light Scattering by Spherical Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a novel and fundamental dual synchronization relationship between the scattering efficiency (Q$_{\text{sca}}$) and a specifically formulated angular distribution complexity parameter ($\widetilde{C}_{\text{p}}$) in spherical particle systems. Through extensive numerical simulations using the rigorous Multiple Sphere T-Matrix (MSTM) method, we found that Q$_{\text{sca}}$ exhibits a strong positive correlation with (1-$\widetilde{C}_{\text{p}}$) when the real part of the refractive index is varied, while it synchronizes strongly and positively with $\widetilde{C}_{\text{p}}$ when the imaginary part is varied. Our analysis reveals that this duality arises from the distinct ways the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index \textbf{perturb vs.~dampen electromagnetic resonances} within the particles, leading to different coupled responses in the total scattered energy and the angular distribution. This discovery provides unprecedented insights into how phase contrast and absorption processes distinctly modulate scattering properties and the angular distribution of scattered light, particularly in regimes dominated by resonance. It establishes that the specific formulation of $\widetilde{C}_{\text{p}}$ used here is sensitive to the overall balance of multipole contributions, making it a valuable parameter for capturing refractive index-driven changes. }.</description>

      <title>Shot-Noise-Limited Laser Frequency Stabilization Using a High-Resolution Wavelength Meter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact laser frequency stabilization method by locking a 556 nm laser to a high-precision wavelength meter. Unlike traditional schemes that rely on optical cavities or atomic references, we stabilize the laser frequency via a closed-loop feedback system referenced to a wavelength meter. This configuration effectively suppresses long-term frequency drifts, achieving frequency stability to the wavelength meter's shot-noise-limited resolution. The system enables sub-hundred-kilohertz stability without complex optical components, making it suitable for compact or field-deployable applications. Our results demonstrate that, with proper feedback design, wavelength meter-based locking can offer a practical and scalable solution for precision optical experiments requiring long-term frequency stability.</description>

      <title>300 mm Wafer-Scale SiN Platform for Broadband Soliton Microcombs Compatible with Alkali Atomic References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-integrated optical frequency combs (OFCs) based on Kerr nonlinear resonators are of great significance given their scalability and wide range of applications. Broadband on-chip OFCs reaching visible wavelengths are especially valuable as they address atomic clock transitions that play an important role in position, navigation, and timing infrastructure. Silicon nitride (SiN) deposited via low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is the usual platform for the fabrication of chip-integrated OFCs, and such fabrication is now standard at wafer sizes up to 200 mm. However, the LPCVD high temperature and film stress poses challenges in scaling to larger wafers and integration with electronic and photonic devices. Here, we report the linear performance and broadband frequency comb generation from microring resonators fabricated on 300 mm wafers at AIM Photonics, using a lower temperature, lower stress plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process that is suitable for thick ($\approx$ 700 nm) SiN films and compatible with electronic and photonic integration. The platform exhibits consistent insertion loss, high intrinsic quality factor, and thickness variation of $\pm$2 % across the whole 300 mm wafer. We demonstrate broadband soliton microcomb generation with a lithographically tunable dispersion profile extending to wavelengths relevant to common alkali atom transitions. These results are a step towards mass-manufacturable devices that integrate OFCs with electronic and active photonic components, enabling advanced applications including optical clocks, LiDAR, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Compact broadband thermal absorbers based on plasmonic fractal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently absorb thermal radiation within a small material volume is crucial for the realization of compact and high spatial resolution thermal imagers. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compact plasmonic metasurface for broadband absorption in the 6 to 14 microns wavelength range. As opposed to previous works, our metasurface leverages strongly localized electromagnetic modes to achieve high absorption within a compact form factor. We numerically investigate the spectral response of finite arrays of fractals and show that the absorption enhancement provided by arrays with greater than 6x6 fractals covering a total area of only 30x30 microns squared is similar to that of an infinitely periodic array. Furthermore, we experimentally validate our metasurface's absorption enhancement and demonstrate a good qualitative agreement between the measured and simulated spectral responses. Owing to its ability to achieve broadband absorption enhancement in a compact footprint, our metasurface provides new avenues for the realization of next generation infrared sensors and bolometers.</description>

      <title>Mirror-mediated long-range coupling and robust phase locking of spatially separated exciton-polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice arrays have been shown to have great value as simulators for complicated mathematical problems. In all physical lattices so far, coupling is only between nearest neighbors or nearest plus next-nearest neighbors; the geometry of the lattice controls the couplings of the sites. Realizing independently tunable, long-range interactions between distant condensates is a prerequisite for scalable analogue spin machines but has so far been restricted to short-range geometric coupling. In this work we show that it is possible using two-dimensional lattices of polariton condensates to use the third dimension to arbitrarily select two sites to couple coherently. Light emitted in the vertical direction from a condensate at one site can be imaged and sent back into the system to impinge on a different condensate at an arbitrary distance. We demonstrate this for the case of two condensates, in which we first ensure that they have no coupling within the plane of the lattice, and then use external imaging to phase lock the two together. Phase-resolved interferometry confirms clearly visible interference fringes and deterministic phase locking even when direct, planar coupling is suppressed. Analytical modeling reveals complementary mechanisms underpinning the robust coherence. Because the mirror adds no cameras, modulators, or electronic processing, the condensate pair operates as a pure, high-bandwidth analog element. Extension to dense graphs via segmented micro-mirror arrays is therefore ultimately limited only by the field of view and numerical aperture of the imaging optics. Our scheme thus paves the way to reconfigurable, energy-efficient polaritonic hardware for optimization, classification, clustering, and other neuromorphic tasks at the speed of light.</description>

      <title>Laser self-injection locking to fiber Fabry-Perot resonator for frequency comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that self-injection locking (SIL) of a distributed feedback (DFB) laser to a high-Q fiber Fabry Perot (FFP) resonator, fabricated with highly nonlinear fiber, allows optical frequency combs (OFC) generation with a laser power as low as 100 mW. More precisely, cavity soliton (CS) regime has been observed in this configuration, along with other types of combs. The laser stabilization using SIL is described. Then the system's behavior is analyzed through modeling the laser's dynamics and comparing the model results to experimental tuning curve measurements. Our findings highlight the critical role of the initial phase of the fiber link between laser and FFP in determining the stability and effectiveness of the locking process. We explore the dynamics of the nonlinear SIL process while varying the laser current, revealing the transition from modulation instability to chaotic comb states, and eventually to soliton formation as the system moves from an effective blue-detuned to an effective red-detuned regime. Notably, the inclusion of self-phase modulation (SPM) in the SIL model predicts accessibility of the narrow soliton existence range. These results highlight the potential of SIL in FFP resonators for low-power, stable OFC generation, offering a promising path forward for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable bound states in the continuum through hybridization of 1D and 2D metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to create and dynamically control quasi-Bound States in the Continuum (BIC) resonances through the hybridization of 1D and 2D metasurfaces using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). By introducing out-of-plane symmetry breaking through a silicon MEMS membrane positioned above a 1D silicon metasurface, the quasi-BIC resonance's central wavelength and quality factor are precisely tuned. The proposed design achieves ultranarrow resonance linewidths with the spectral tuning range exceeding 60 nm while maintaining a constant quality factor. This tuning capability, realized through both horizontal displacement within a 1D metasurface and vertical MEMS membrane movement, offers a new degree of freedom for manipulating quasi-BIC resonances. The proposed hybridization of 2D and 1D metasurfaces using MEMS mechanism provides a practical route to dynamic modulation of transmission resonance characteristics, making it a promising candidate for tunable filters, spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in monolithic photonic waveguides by leveraging intrinsic crystal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced photonic quantum technologies -- from quantum key distribution to quantum computing -- require on-chip sources of entangled photons that are both efficient and readily scalable. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in structurally simple waveguides by exploiting the intrinsic properties of nonlinear crystals. We thereby circumvent elaborate phase-matching strategies that commonly involve the spatial modulation of a waveguide's linear or nonlinear optical properties. We derive general criteria for the second-order susceptibility tensor that enable the generation of cross-polarized photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in single-material waveguides. Based on these criteria, we systematically categorize all birefringent, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes in terms of their suitability. Using coupled mode theory, we then numerically analyze cuboid waveguides made from two materials that are highly relevant to integrated photonics: lithium niobate, a well-established platform, and barium titanate, an emerging alternative. We find that barium titanate consistently outperforms lithium niobate by providing a higher nonlinear efficiency and high concurrence over a significantly broader spectral range. These findings outline a practical route toward highly efficient, fabrication-friendly, and scalable sources of polarization-entangled photons for integrated quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Spatial Filtering with Nonlocal Non-Hermitian Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial filtering of optical fields has widespread applications ranging from beam shaping to optical information processing. However, conventional spatial filters are bulky and alignment-sensitive. Here, we present nonlocal non-Hermitian metasurfaces that can act as exceptionally effective optical spatial filters while being highly compact and insensitive to both lateral and longitudinal displacements. The metasurface design is based on a resonant waveguide grating in which radiative losses of the modes are tailored to realize a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum in the middle of a non-Hermitian flat band. Using this design, we propose a compact spatial filtering device operating over an angular range of approximately 1 degree around normal incidence. In addition to being ultrathin and robust against translational misalignment, the proposed metasurfaces are easy to manufacture, which makes them an attractive alternative to conventional spatial filters, holding a potential to become a widely used optical component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of materials serves as the foundation for a broad range of vital applications, including but not limited to imaging, sensing, as well as classical and quantum communications. Here we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, a fundamentally new regime of electromagnetic material response originating from inherent material nonlocality, leading to effective ``spooky action at a distance''. We show that by structuring materials on the scale of their inherent nonlocality, it becomes possible to reveal the ``primordial'' nonlocal response of the components and design materials with strong overall nonlocality, easily detectable at room temperatures and in realistic (lossy) materials. Designer primordial nonlocality offers a new dimension in controlling light-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: Metalenses, owing to their ultra-thin planar structures, present a promising solution for reducing endoscopic invasiveness. However, achieving high-quality imaging with minimal invasiveness (short focal length of metalens) remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a deep learning assisted metalens with a 1mm focal length (corresponding to NA = 0.447) tailored for coherent fiber bundle, constituting the least invasive metalens-CFB system reported to date. To overcome the increased chromatic dispersion and aberrations associated with high NA metalens, we develop a Metalens Image Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network to restore images from metalens designed with angularly consistent modulation transfer functions. In parallel, Metal-Height Compensated Etching (MHCE) is applied to compensate for lateral etching at the bottom of high aspect ratio nanopillars, achieving uniform 90{\deg} vertical sidewalls throughout the metalens and improving the phase accuracy. Subsequent experiments with the metalens-CFB system confirm that the metalens expands the field of view of CFB to 48.3{\deg} and extends the depth of field beyond 125 mm. This work accelerates the development of ultra-minimally invasive endoscopic imaging system.</description>

      <title>Broadband nonlinear optical microresonator array for topological second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics enables robust light manipulation with third-order optical nonlinearity, yet integrating second-order optical nonlinearity into a topological system faces fundamental challenges: frequency-dependent topological bandgaps impede simultaneous edge states for pump and second harmonic photons at an octave. Here we present a broadband topological nonlinear photonic system via dual frequency topological bandgap engineering in a 2D nonlinear microresonator array. By designing a square lattice with synthetic magnetic fluxes, we achieve topological phase matching preserving unidirectional edge states for both frequencies while enabling efficient second-harmonic generation. The system exhibits flux-programmable SH chirality, where SH photons reverse propagation direction via Chern number transitions (e.g. C = -1 to +1) without sacrificing robustness. Moreover, we show that the design theoretically yields over 100 times higher SHG efficiency than single resonators at high powers via topology-enhanced coherent buildup. Our topological SHG works in a parameter regime that can be readily accessed by using existing low-loss integrated photon platforms like thin film lithium niobite.</description>

      <title>Mechanically Reconfigurable GRIN Lens Concept for Focusing and Beamforming Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a prospective concept of a mechanically reconfigurable Gradient Index (GRIN) lens for focusing and beamforming applications. The lens is formed by corrugated layers, each realizing a refractive index profile expressed in a basis of Chebyshev polynomials. The focal point position is controlled by shifting the GRIN lens layers. A geometrical optics-based approach is implemented for the three scenarios of focusing at varying focal distance. The geometrical optics results are validated by numerical simulations, with some discrepancies observed due to modeling approximations and structural granularity. We also discuss scalability of the proposed concept for operation at infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Laser-cut Patterned, Micrometer-thin Diamond Membranes with Coherent Color Centers for Open Microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum sensing and networking experiments, including the integration of color centers into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes. The method can be used to fabricate devices with micrometer thicknesses and edge lengths of typically 10 $\mu m$ to 100 $\mu m$. We compare this method with an established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers suitable for applications in quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Observing High-dimensional Nonlocality using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify nonlocality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Probing valence electron and hydrogen dynamics using charge-pair imaging with ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in ultrafast science has been to directly track the coupled motions of electrons and nuclei in real-space and real-time. This study presents a significant step towards this goal by demonstrating the feasibility of time-resolved real-space tracking of valence electron and hydrogen dynamics during the photodissociation of ammonia (NH3) using MeV ultrafast electron diffraction. It is demonstrated that the enhanced temporal resolution, in conjunction with the analysis of the charge-pair distribution function, enables the disentanglement of the correlated motion of valence electrons and hydrogens in photoexcited ammonia molecule. The methodology employed in this study, which utilizes the charge-pair distribution function from ultrafast electron scattering to retrieve intertwined electron and nucleus dynamics, may open up new opportunities in the study of quantum dynamics for a wide range of molecules.</description>

      <title>Anomalous refractive index modulation and giant birefringence in 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Additionally, we observe a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.</description>

      <title>Counter-propagating spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in lithium niobate on insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate, and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity, and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast photocurrent detection reveals that device efficiency is dominated by ultrafast exciton dissociation not exciton diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons diffusing to a charge-separating interface is a necessary step to convert energy into current in next-generation photovoltaics. In this report, made possible by a new ultrafast spectrometer design, we compare exciton dynamics measured using both photoabsorption- and photocurrent-detected transient and 2D spectroscopies. For a device with semiconducting carbon nanotubes as the exciton transport material, we find that photoabsorption detection greatly overestimates the importance of long-lived excitons for device performance. Excitons diffuse and transfer between nanotubes for several picoseconds, but the large majority of photocurrent is created within 30fs by excitons that diffuse little to the C60 electron transfer material. These results change our understanding of the material features most important for these photovoltaics. Photoabsorption detection measures all excitons, but not all photogenerated excitons generate current. To understand device efficiency, this study points to the necessity for directly measuring the exciton dynamics responsible for photocurrent.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Oscillating Window Driven by an Intense Laguerre Gaussian Laser Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation by the diffraction of an intense Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser beam through a small aperture is studied. It is found that the 2D peripheral electron dynamics on the rim can facilitate complex interplay between the spin and orbital angular momentum interaction, which leads to distinct selection rules for LG pulses with different polarization states. In particular, when the driver is linearly polarized, the harmonic beams no longer follow a simple orbital angular momentum conservation rule. Instead, multiple LG modes with different topological charges are produced in each harmonic beam, and the number of modes equals to the harmonic order. A theory is derived and validated by simulations, which can predict the harmonic topological charges as well as their relative intensities for LG drivers with different polarization states. Our work provides fundamental insight into the behavior of light in nonlinear optics, and paves the way towards high-intensity UV or X-ray pulses carrying controllable OAM, that can serve as versatile tools at frontiers of various scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave detectors have achieved remarkable sensitivity around 100 Hz, enabling ground-breaking discoveries. Enhancing sensitivity at higher frequencies in the kilohertz (kHz) range promises access to rich physics, particularly the extreme conditions during the merger stage of binary neutron stars. However, the high-frequency sensitivity of Michelson-based interferometers is fundamentally limited by their linear optical cavities, which are optimized for low-frequency signal enhancement. In [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)], a new configuration employing an L-shaped optical resonator was proposed to overcome this limitation, offering exceptional sensitivity in the kHz band. As a pathfinder, the 12-meter prototype at Beijing Normal University is designed to demonstrate the sensing and control schemes of this new kHz detector configuration and to explore its performance in the high-power regime with suspended optics. Beyond its primary scientific goal, the prototype also offers potential sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, potentially enabling constraints on exotic sources. This paper presents an overview of the prototype, including its optical design and current development status of key components.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser-written nano-ablations containing bright antibunched emitters on gallium nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser-writing offers distinct capabilities for fabrication, including three-dimensional, multi-material, and sub-diffraction-limited patterning. In particular, demonstrations of laser-written quantum emitters and photonic devices with superior optical properties have attracted attention. Recently, gallium nitride (GaN) has been reported to host quantum emitters with narrow and bright zero-phonon photoluminescence from ultraviolet to telecom ranges. However, emitters formed during epitaxy are randomly positioned, and until now, it has not been possible to fabricate quantum emitters in ordered arrays. In this paper, we employ femtosecond laser writing to create nano-ablations with sub-diffraction-limited diameter, and use rapid thermal annealing to activate co-located stable emitters. The emitters show MHz antibunched emission with a sharp spectral peak at room temperature. Our study not only presents an efficient approach to laser-written nanofabrication on GaN but also offers a promising pathway for the deterministic creation of quantum emitters in GaN, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved.</description>

      <title>Towards Navigation-Grade and Deployable Optomechanical Accelerometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design and experimentally demonstrate an architecture for achieving navigation-grade, fiber-packaged optomechanical accelerometers that can operate with a large dynamic range, over a wide temperature range, and without sophisticated laser sources. Our accelerometer architecture is based on a novel set of design principles that take advantage of the strengths of optomechanical accelerometry while eliminating many of its historical weaknesses. Displacement readout is provided by an integrated, differential strain-sensing Mach-Zehnder interferometer (DSMZI) attached to an ultra-rigid, bulk-micromachined proof mass having a 93.4 kHz fundamental resonance frequency (22.5 pm/g displacement). Despite the extreme rigidity, the high displacement sensitivity provides an insertion loss limited 4.2 $\mu g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ acceleration resolution, with a straight-forward path to achieving 330 $n g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by improving the fiber-to-chip coupling. Further, we show that the combination of high rigidity and intrinsic differential optical readout makes the device insensitive to the common causes of bias instability, and we measure a bias instability of 6.3 $\mu g$ at 243 seconds. The DSMZI provides a 17 nm optical bandwidth and a temperature operating range of greater than 20 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, both orders of magnitude larger than previous demonstrations of optomechanical accelerometers. The high rigidity and large optical bandwidth yield an expected dynamic range of 165.4 dB. The combination of high acceleration resolution, high dynamic range, low bias instability, and intrinsic insensitivity to wavelength, temperature, and package stresses makes our device well suited for deployment in realistic environments demanded by real-world applications and demonstrates a path for optomechanical accelerometers to ultimately exceed the performance of all other chip-based accelerometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04796v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral estimation problem of estimating the locations of a fixed number of point sources given multiple snapshots of Fourier measurements in a bounded domain. We aim to provide a mathematical foundation for sparsity-based super-resolution in such spectral estimation problems in both one- and multi-dimensional spaces. In particular, we estimate the resolution and stability of the location recovery when considering the sparsest solution under the measurement constraint, and characterize their dependence on the cut-off frequency, the noise level, the sparsity of point sources, and the incoherence of the amplitude vectors of point sources. Our estimate emphasizes the importance of the high incoherence of amplitude vectors in enhancing the resolution of multi-snapshot spectral estimation. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it also provides the first stability result in the super-resolution regime for the well-known sparse MMV problem in DOA estimation.</description>

Abstract: We compare two amplification schemes, photon addition and then subtraction ($\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$) and successive photon addition ($\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$), applied to hybrid entangled states (HESs) and superpositions of coherent states (SCSs). We show that the amplification schemes' fidelity and gain for HESs are the same as those of coherent states. On the other hand, SCSs show quite nontrivial behaviors by the amplification schemes, depending on the amplitudes of coherent states, number of coherent-state components, and relative phases between the components. This implies that appropriate amplification schemes for SCSs should be chosen depending on the tasks and specific forms of the states. To investigate the quality of amplified states, we calculate the quantum Fisher information, a measure of quantum phase estimation. In terms of the quantum Fisher information, the $\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$ scheme tends to show better performance for relatively small amplitudes while the $\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$ scheme is better in larger amplitude regime. The performance of the two schemes becomes indistinguishable as the amplitude grows sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via quantum interference</title>

Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Taken together with prior demonstrations of extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, this suggest that substantial performance gains are achievable with current technology under realistic, non-ideal conditions. This offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems. Fundamentally, the discovery that quantum interference and measurements, used together, are more robust to both loss and noise than standard measurement techniques opens the possibility of broad applications across quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22874</link>

Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are severely limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, which reveals a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating. Evaporation rates dramatically increase with short-wavelength illumination. Violet-light illumination achieves 4-10x higher evaporation enhancement compared to orange and IR light. Our results identify a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation and opportunities to employ ceramic wicks for salt harvesting. Such low-cost, low-energy desalination systems would reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>
