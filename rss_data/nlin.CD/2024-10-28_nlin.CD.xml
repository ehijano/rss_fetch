      <title>Singularity of Levy walks in the lifted Pomeau-Manneville map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Parallelization of Network Dynamics Computations in Heterogeneous Distributed Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of parallelizing computations to study non-linear dynamics in large networks of non-locally coupled oscillators using heterogeneous computing resources. The proposed approach can be applied to a variety of non-linear dynamics models with runtime specification of parameters and network topologies. Parallelizing the solution of equations for different network elements is performed transparently and, in contrast to available tools, does not require parallel programming from end-users. The runtime scheduler takes into account the performance of computing and communication resources to reduce downtime and to achieve a quasi-optimal parallelizing speed-up. The proposed approach was implemented, and its efficiency is proven by numerous applications for simulating large dynamical networks with 10^3-10^8 elements described by Hodgkin-Huxley, FitzHugh-Nagumo, and Kuramoto models, for investigating pathological synchronization during Parkinson's disease, analyzing multi-stability, for studying chimera and solitary states in 3D networks, etc. All the above computations may be performed using symmetrical multiprocessors, graphic processing units, and a network of workstations within the same run and it was demonstrated that near-linear speed-up can be achieved for large networks. The proposed approach is promising for extension to new hardware like edge-computing devices.</description>

      <title>Improved detection of chaos with Lagrangian descriptors using differential algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) based on the arc length of orbits previously demonstrated their utility in delineating structures governing the dynamics. Recently, a chaos indicator based on the second derivatives of the LDs, referred to as $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$, has been introduced to distinguish regular and chaotic trajectories. Thus far, the derivatives are numerically approximated using finite differences on fine meshes of initial conditions. In this paper, we instead use the differential algebra (DA) framework as a form of automatic differentiation to introduce and compute $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$ up to machine precision. We discuss and exemplify benefits of this framework, such as the determination of reliable thresholds to distinguish ordered from chaotic trajectories. Our extensive parametric study quantitatively assesses the accuracy and sensitivity of both the finite differences and differential arithmetic approaches by focusing on paradigmatic discrete models of Hamiltonian chaos, namely the Chirikov's standard map and coupled $4$-dimensional variants. Our results demonstrate that finite difference techniques for $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$ might lead to significant misclassification rate, up to $20\%$ when the phase space supports thin resonant webs, due to the difficulty to determine appropriate thresholds. On the contrary, $\vert\vert \Delta \rm{LD} \vert\vert$ computed through DA arithmetic leads to clear bimodal distributions which in turn lead to robust thresholds. As a consequence, the DA framework reveals as sensitive as established first order tangent map based indicators, independently of the underlying dynamical regime. Finally, the benefits of the DA framework are also highlighted for non-uniform depleted meshes of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>How high dimensional neural dynamics are confined in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High dimensional dynamics play a vital role in brain function, ecological systems, and neuro-inspired machine learning. Where and how these dynamics are confined in the phase space remains challenging to solve. Here, we provide an analytic argument that the confinement region is an M-shape when the neural dynamics show a diversity, with two sharp boundaries and a flat low-density region in between. Despite increasing synaptic strengths in a neural circuit, the shape remains qualitatively the same, while the left boundary is continuously pushed away. However, in deep chaotic regions, an arch-shaped confinement gradually emerges. Our theory is supported by numerical simulations on finite-sized networks. This analytic theory opens up a geometric route towards addressing fundamental questions about high dimensional non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>New Coevolution Dynamic as an Optimization Strategy in Group Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coevolution on social models couples the time evolution of the network with the time evolution of the states of the agents. This paper presents a new coevolution dynamic allowing more than one rewiring on the network. We explore how this coevolution can be employed as an optimization strategy for problem-solving capability of task-forces. We used an agent-based model study how this new coevolution dynamic can help a group of agents whose task is to find the global maxima of NK fitness landscapes. Each agent can replace more than one neighbors, and this quantity is a tunable parameter in the model. These rewirings is a way for the agent to obtain information from individuals that were not previously part of its neighborhood. Our results showed that this tunable coevolution can indeed produce gain on the computational cost under certain circunstances. At low average degree (using a random network to connect the agents) and on easy landscape, more rewirings return lower cost, helping the agents to find the global maximum faster. However, at larger average degree and difficult landscape, the effect is more complex. At medium size systems, the coevolution brings optimal results when 3 or 4 neighbors are replaced.</description>

      <title>A logarithm law for nonautonomous systems fastly converging to equilibrium and mean field coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a nonautonomous system has in a certain sense a fast convergence to equilibrium (faster than any power law behavior) then the time $\tau _{r}(x,y)$ needed for a typical point $x$ to enter for the first time in a ball $B(y,r)$ centered in $y$, with small radius \ $r $ scales as the local dimension of the equilibrium measure \ $\mu $ at $y$, i.e. $$ \underset{r\rightarrow 0}{\lim }\frac{\log \tau _{r}(x,y)}{-\log r}% =d_{\mu }(y).$$
  We then apply the general result to concrete systems of different kind, showing such a logarithm law for asymptotically authonomous solenoidal maps and mean field coupled expanding maps.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>

      <title>Impact of pressure anisotropy on the cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with biadiabatic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of ion pressure anisotropy on the energy cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with biadiabatic ions and isothermal electrons is evaluated in three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, using the exact (or third-order) law derived in \citet{simon_exact_2022}. It is shown that pressure anisotropy can enhance or reduce the cascade rate, depending on the scales, in comparison with the prediction of the exact law with isotropic pressure, by an amount that correlates well with pressure anisotropy $a_p=\frac{p_\perp}{p_\parallel}\neq1$ that develops in simulations initialized with an isotropic pressure (${a_p}_0=1$). A simulation with initial pressure anisotropy, ${a_p}_0=4$, confirms this trend, exhibiting a stronger impact on the cascade rate, both in the inertial range and at larger scales, close to the forcing scales. Furthermore, a Fourier-based numerical method, to compute exact laws in numerical simulations in the full $(\ell_\perp,\ell_\parallel)$ increment plane, is presented.</description>
