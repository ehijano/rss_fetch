      <title>Convex Order and Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wiesel and Zhang [2023] established that two probability measures $\mu,\nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite second moments are in convex order (i.e. $\mu \preceq_c \nu$) if and only if $W_2(\nu,\rho)^2-W_2(\mu,\rho)^2 \leq \int |y|^2\nu(dy) - \int |x|^2\mu(dx).$ Let us call a measure $\rho$ maximizing $W_2(\nu,\rho)^2-W_2(\mu,\rho)^2$ the optimal $\rho$. This paper summarizes key findings by Wiesel and Zhang, develops new algorithms enhancing the search of optimal $\rho$, and builds on the paper through constructing a model-independent arbitrage strategy and developing associated numerical methods via the convex function recovered from the optimal $\rho$ through Brenier's theorem. In addition to examining the link between convex order and arbitrage through the lens of optimal transport, the paper also gives a brief survey of functionally generated portfolio in stochastic portfolio theory and offers a conjecture of the link between convex order and arbitrage between two functionally generated portfolios.</description>

      <title>Linking Path-Dependent and Stochastic Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a link between stochastic volatility (SV) and path-dependent volatility (PDV) models. Using assumed density filtering, we map a given SV model into a corresponding PDV representation. The resulting specification is lightweight, improves in-sample fit, and delivers robust out-of-sample forecasts. We also introduce a calibration procedure for both SV and PDV models that produces standard errors for parameter estimates and supports joint calibration of SPX/VIX smile.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent Kyle equilibrium model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06395v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an auction type equilibrium model with an insider in line with the one originally introduced by Kyle in 1985 and then extended to the continuous time setting by Back in 1992. The novelty introduced with this paper is that we deal with a general price functional depending on the whole past of the aggregate demand, i.e. we work with path-dependency. By using the functional It\^o calculus, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an equilibrium. Furthermore, we consider both the cases of a risk-neutral and a risk-averse insider.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model revisited: a systematic derivation from an exact BBGKY hierarchy for the zero-intelligence limit-order book model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Santa Fe model is an established econophysics model for describing stochastic dynamics of the limit order book from the viewpoint of the zero-intelligence approach. While its foundation was studied by combining a dimensional analysis and a mean-field theory by E. Smith et al. in Quantitative Finance 2003, their arguments are rather heuristic and lack solid mathematical foundation; indeed, their mean-field equations were derived with heuristic arguments and their solutions were not explicitly obtained. In this work, we revisit the mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model from the viewpoint of kinetic theory -- a traditional mathematical program in statistical physics. We study the exact master equation for the Santa Fe model and systematically derive the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchical equation. By applying the mean-field approximation, we derive the mean-field equation for the order-book density profile, parallel to the Boltzmann equation in conventional statistical physics. Furthermore, we obtain explicit and closed expression of the mean-field solutions. Our solutions have several implications: (1)Our scaling formulas are available for both $\mu\to 0$ and $\mu\to \infty$ asymptotics, where $\mu$ is the market-order submission intensity. Particularly, the mean-field theory works very well for small $\mu$, while its validity is partially limited for large $\mu$. (2)The ``method of image'' solution, heuristically derived by Bouchaud-M\'ezard-Potters in Quantitative Finance 2002, is obtained for large $\mu$, serving as a mathematical foundation for their heuristic arguments. (3)Finally, we point out an error in E. Smith et al. 2003 in the scaling law for the diffusion constant due to a misspecification in their dimensional analysis.</description>

      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this paper formulates the Epstein-Zin preference for discounted dividends received by an investor as an Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We introduce a backward stochastic differential equation with an aggregator integrated with respect to a singular control, prove its well-posedness, and show that it coincides with the Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We then establish that this formulation is equivalent to a robust dividend policy chosen by the firm's executive under the Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. In particular, the robust dividend policy takes the form of a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process, where the threshold level is characterized as the free boundary of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>
