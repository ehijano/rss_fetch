      <description>arXiv:2601.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of lightweight flex PCBs and nanowire-based thermal interfaces for low-mass, high-performance detector modules are presented. A novel manufacturing approach targeting flex circuits with double-sided pad access, assembled using ACF and gold studs.

      <title>Recursive Manifold Coherence: A Geometric Framework for Deadtime Recovery in Distributed Trigger Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime and signal pile-up, leading to systematic inefficiencies in conventional coincidence-based trigger systems. Such triggers typically rely on binary temporal windows and assume continuous sensor availability, causing partial or complete loss of correlated signal information during non-live intervals. We introduce Recursive Manifold Coherence (RMC), a geometric framework that reformulates distributed trigger logic as a continuous state estimation problem in a low-dimensional information space defined by correlated charge and timing observables. Instead of applying hard vetoes during deadtime, the proposed method employs a recursive update rule that propagates a coherence state across sensor nodes, allowing partially obscured signals to be retained and evaluated consistently. Using simulation studies representative of large optical detector arrays, we demonstrate that RMC successfully recovers event-level coherence for high-multiplicity topologies even when direct coincidence chains are broken. By treating the detector response as a smooth manifold rather than discrete hits, the framework achieves superior robustness against data fragmentation compared to standard binary logic. The framework is detector-agnostic and compatible with software-defined trigger pipelines, providing a flexible foundation for deadtime-aware analysis and triggering strategies in future distributed detector systems.</description>

      <title>Industrial Deposition of Wavelength-Shifting Films for Liquid Argon Photon Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Phase-II Far Detector is considering an unprecedentedly large-area ~2000 m$^2$ photon detection system to achieve a target mean light yield of 180 PE/MeV. Meeting this requirement demands scalable, cost-effective, and high-quality wavelength-shifter (WLS) coatings capable of converting 127 nm liquid-argon scintillation light into visible photons with high efficiency. We report on the successful realization of an industrial physical vapor deposition (PVD) process for \textit{p}-terphenyl (pTP) coatings, adapted from vacuum deposition techniques developed for OLED display manufacturing, to produce uniform WLS layers on large-area inorganic substrates, a task traditionally challenged by adhesion and uniformity issues at organic--inorganic interfaces. Surface characterization by profilometry and spectroscopic measurements confirms sub-10% thickness uniformity for 1-2 $\mu$m films and emission spectra consistent with high-quality pTP reference samples. The industrial process demonstrates reproducibility, scalability, and significantly reduced production time compared to laboratory-based methods, while maintaining the optical quality required for large-scale liquid-argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) photon detection systems. These results establish a viable pathway for mass production of high-performance pTP coatings for DUNE FD3 and future neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Gamma-Neutron Source Classification in Water Cherenkov Detectors: Energy Threshold Screening and Machine Learning Pulse Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water Cherenkov detectors offer a robust and economical solution for real-time radiation monitoring by detecting Cherenkov light from charged particles moving faster than light in water. This work presents a novel two-stage classification framework for gamma-neutron discrimination: an initial physics-based energy threshold filters unambiguous low-energy gamma sources, followed by a machine learning ensemble that resolves ambiguities at higher energies. The detector response was characterized using $^{60}$Co (1.17/1.33~MeV), $^{137}$Cs (0.66~MeV), and a shielded $^{241}$AmBe source, with lead, paraffin, and cadmium shielding employed to isolate neutron and gamma interactions. Energy calibration established a linear ADU to MeV conversion ($R^2 = 0.966$), enabling identification of a neutron detection threshold at $2.62 \pm 0.77$~MeV via a $3\sigma$ significance analysis. Stage one categorizes sources as pure gamma (below threshold) or neutron-emitting (at threshold). For ambiguous cases above threshold, a machine learning pipeline utilizing pulse shape analysis was developed. A soft voting ensemble (Bagging, CatBoost, and MLP) achieved an accuracy of 0.816 and an AUC of 0.921. This hybrid scheme combines physics-based filtering with ML refinement, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for nuclear security, nonproliferation monitoring, and fundamental radiation research.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the beam-induced depolarization of the HJET target at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polarized Atomic Hydrogen Gas Jet Target (HJET) has played a central role in the absolute calibration of proton beam polarization at RHIC and is foreseen as a key element of the hadron polarimetry program at the future Electron--Ion Collider (EIC). The substantially higher beam current, reduced bunch spacing, and shorter bunch length planned for EIC operation motivate a careful reassessment of possible beam-induced depolarization of the jet target. In this paper, the depolarization of ground-state hydrogen atoms caused by the time-dependent magnetic field of the circulating polarized proton beam is quantitatively evaluated. The hydrogen atom is treated as a four-level hyperfine system in a holding magnetic field, and transitions driven by harmonic components of the bunch-induced magnetic field are analyzed using time-dependent quantum-mechanical evolution along atomic trajectories. Numerical tracking of hydrogen atoms through the beam region is performed using nominal EIC beam parameters. It is shown that, for a holding field of $120\,\mathrm{mT}$ (as used at RHIC), the resulting depolarization of the jet target at the EIC is negligibly small, $\lesssim 0.01\%$, and well below the level relevant for EIC polarization accuracy requirements. The stability of this result with respect to plausible variations of the EIC proton beam parameters is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Polyurethane-Based Scintillators for Neutron and Gamma Radiation Detection in Medical and Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic scintillators using a solid polyurethane (PU) matrix have been introduced to combine the robustness of a construction material with scintillating properties that allow gamma rays and fast neutrons to be detected efficiently and at low cost. This work compares two corresponding materials, the older M600 and the more recent M700, with EJ-276D and EJ-200 representing common plastic scintillators with and without pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) capabilities, respectively. Characterization measurements were performed with small samples of 26 mm diameter and 10 mm height, which were coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and simultaneously exposed to 252Cf fission neutrons and 137Cs gamma rays. M700 turned out to provide the best PSD performance and about the same light yield as EJ-276D, while its light pulses exhibit a shorter pulse decay. An accelerated ageing process applied in between two test campaigns was too short to trigger distinct performance degradation in any of the materials, though optical degradation was visible in EJ-276D and in EJ-200 but not in the PU-based materials. Nevertheless, the extremely robust polyurethane matrix promises advantages in medical and industrial applications where resilience and long-term stability are of crucial importance.</description>

      <title>Full event interpretation with machine-learning-based particle-flow reconstruction in the CMS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle-flow (PF) algorithm constructs a global description of each particle collision by producing a comprehensive list of final-state particles, and is central to event reconstruction in the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The existing PF implementation relies on physics-motivated heuristics and assumptions that can be replaced by machine-learning (ML) models trained directly on simulated data and naturally suited to modern graphics processing units (GPUs). A state-of-the-art ML-based PF (MLPF) reconstruction algorithm, implemented within the CMS software framework, is presented. The MLPF algorithm performs a learnable full-event reconstruction on GPUs, generalizes across detector conditions and collision energies, and replaces multiple modular reconstruction steps with a single unified model. Physics performance comparable to standard PF reconstruction is achieved in both simulation and data, with improved jet energy resolution and inference time. In simulated top quark-antiquark events under LHC Run-3 (2023$-$2024) conditions, the jet energy resolution improves by 10$-$20% for jets with transverse momentum between 30$-$100 GeV. Inference time is evaluated using simulated multijet events, with a median of 20 ms per event on an Nvidia L4 GPU, compared to approximately 110 ms for the standard CMS PF reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Design of a Miniature Kibble Balance for Kilogram-Scale Mass Calibration -- KBmini</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabletop version Kibble balances are a significant developing trend for mass realizations following the revised International System of Units. A key innovation through the miniaturization of the Kibble balance from a large-scale instrument into a tabletop device is making the quantum-based realization of mass accessible to a wider range of calibration laboratories and industries. This paper presents a tabletop Kibble balance design at Tsinghua University targeting E2-accuracy class mass calibrations from 1 g to 1 kg. For calibrating a mass of 1 kg, for instance, the required relative standard measurement uncertainty must be below 0.27 ppm to meet E2-accuracy class. Major components and features of the proposed system are discussed. A novel method of multi-harmonic excitation is proposed to improve the coil-motion linearity during velocity measurement. We show that injecting odd-order harmonics into the motion-driving current can significantly improve the uniformity of the coil's moving velocity, while the second-order component can address the asymmetry between upward and downward movements. This achieves a flat velocity $\Delta v/v&lt; 5\%$ over 60% of the motion cycle.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Deadtime in Distributed Optical Arrays: A Liveness-Aware Trigger Approach for High-Energy Neutrino Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime arising from photomultiplier saturation, digitizer limits, and front-end readout constraints. Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions. This method provides a robust foundation for next-generation firmware-level trigger strategies in large-scale, noise-dominated detector systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive Beam Monitoring via Secondary Radiation Detection with Ce-Doped Silica Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-destructive beam diagnostics are essential for low-energy medical cyclotrons, where even thin interceptive devices can severely degrade beam quality. We investigate an external fiber monitor (EFM) based on Ce-doped silica scintillating fibers that detects secondary radiation generated at existing beamline components of the 18 MeV Bern Medical Cyclotron beam transfer line (BTL). Three use cases were studied: (i) beam intensity monitoring around an electrically isolated, water-cooled beam dump; (ii) beam-loss monitoring around a 10 mm collimator under varying the beam focusing; and (iii) by steering a 6.5 mm $\times$ 6.5 mm beam spot on a beam dump. For case (i), the summed EFM signal exhibits a linear dependence on the current on target over nearly three orders of magnitude. In case (ii), a normalized EFM-based beam-loss proxy scales monotonically with an electrical loss proxy across several focusing settings. Furthermore, opposing-fiber signal ratios provide decoupled, monotonic sensitivity to horizontal and vertical beam displacements.</description>

      <title>Precision Light Yield and Crosstalk Characterization for the SuperFGD scintillator cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed study of a $5\times5\times5$ cube prototype of the SuperFGD detector was performed using a 730 MeV/$c$ pion beam at the SC-1000 synchrocyclotron (PNPI, Gatchina, Russia). The detector, based on plastic scintillation cubes with orthogonal wavelength-shifting (WLS) fiber readout and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), was tested to evaluate its performance in terms of light yield, spatial uniformity, and optical crosstalk. Using high-resolution tracking, the spatial distribution of light yield was mapped with a granularity of 0.5 mm. An average light response map was obtained by combining data from 27 cubes. Optical crosstalk between adjacent cubes was also measured and characterized in four directions (left, right, up, down). Position-dependent crosstalk values ranged from 2% to 6%, with the highest levels observed near cube interfaces. These results confirm the excellent performance and scalability of the SuperFGD design, and provide valuable input for simulation tuning and reconstruction algorithms in the ND280 upgrade of the T2K experiment. The obtained result on the response uniformity and crosstalk are reasonably well described by simple MC model of the setup.</description>

      <title>OptiGAN for Crystal Arrays: Physics-Informed Generative Modeling of Optical Photon Transport in PET Detector Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations of optical photon transport are computationally prohibitive for large-scale optical systems including detector arrays and PET systems, restricting practical use to single-crystal studies. This work presents an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network (optiGAN) replacing optical simulations at the crystal array level, extending our single-crystal approach to a 3x3 BGO array. We enhance the Wasserstein-GAN framework with Fourier feature encoding, a learnable latent mapping network, and a physics-informed loss enforcing momentum conservation. Training data is reduced eight-fold by exploiting symmetry. Evaluation employs three studies: a full array evaluation testing generalization from the fundamental domain to the complete geometry, a high-resolution study probing out-of-distribution generalization to untrained positions, and a pencil beam $\gamma$-photon study assessing practical applicability for experimental detector characterization. Performance is benchmarked against GATE10/Geant4 ground truth, using intrinsic fluctuations between independent Monte Carlo runs as baseline. OptiGAN achieves sliced Wasserstein similarity within 3$\sigma$-agreement of the baseline across all conditions, demonstrating successful generalization to the full array. The model transitions from electron-emission training data to realistic $\gamma$-photon interactions, producing flood maps that reproduce characteristic patterns including photopeak clusters and inter-crystal scatter lines. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that physics-informed generative models can accurately simulate optical photon transport in segmented scintillator arrays. The reproduction of experimentally relevant flood map features validates optiGAN for PET detector development and establishes a foundation for models generalizing across diverse array configurations.</description>

      <title>Detecting the full photoemission cone from laser-based ARPES experiments by leveraging deflector technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct access to the electronic band structure of solid and molecular systems. The momentum range accessible by this technique depends directly on the photon energy used, and low-photon-energy sources are insufficient to photoemit electrons over the full Brillouin zone of most quantum materials. In addition, while electrons are emitted over a 2$\pi$ solid angle, conventional hemispherical analyzers only collect a small subset of those electrons. A previous work [RSI 92, 123907 (2021)] demonstrated that electrons emitted over a larger field-of-view can be acquired in one fixed configuration by accelerating them towards the analyzer with a bias voltage. Here, we extend this work by leveraging the deflector technology of novel ARPES hemispherical analyzers. We demonstrate the ability to detect all $2\pi$ photoemitted electrons in a fixed configuration for various materials such as gold, cuprates and transition-metal dichalcogenides. This approach is especially advantageous for time-resolved ARPES, as electron dynamics over a large momentum range can be accessed with identical measurement conditions.</description>

Abstract: BUTTON-30 is a neutrino detector demonstrator located in the STFC Boulby underground facility in the north-east of England. The main goal of the project is to deploy and test the performance of the gadolinium-loaded water-based liquid scintillator for neutrino detection in an underground environment. This will pave the way for a future large-volume neutrino observatory that can also perform remote monitoring of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. This paper describes the design and construction of the watertight optical modules of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Athermal Phonon Responsivity in a Kinetic Inductance Detector with Integrated Phonon Collectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in light dark matter searches and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments as they can achieve low energy thresholds. The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.</description>

      <title>The use of spectral indices in environmental monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study aimed to evaluate the applicability of environmental indices in the monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps. A dump located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin served as the research site for a multi-method analysis combining remote sensing and field-based data. Two UAV survey campaigns were conducted, capturing RGB, infrared, and multispectral imagery. These were supplemented with direct ground measurements of subsurface temperature and detailed vegetation mapping. Additionally, publicly available satellite data from the Landsat and Sentinel missions were analysed. A range of vegetation and fire-related indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, BAI, among others) were calculated to identify thermally active zones and assess vegetation conditions within these degraded areas. The results revealed strong seasonal variability in vegetation indices on thermally active sites, with evidence of disrupted vegetation cycles, including winter greening in moderately heated root zones - a pattern indicative of stress and degradation processes. While satellite data proved useful in reconstructing the fire history of the dump, their spatial resolution was insufficient for detailed monitoring of small-scale thermal anomalies. The study highlights the diagnostic potential of UAV-based remote sensing in post-industrial environments undergoing land degradation but emphasises the importance of field validation for accurate environmental assessment.</description>
