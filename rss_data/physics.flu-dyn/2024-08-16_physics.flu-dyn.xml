      <title>Hydrodynamics of Semi-Submersible Vehicle Hulls with Variable Height-Width Ratio in Deep and Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-submersible vehicles keep most of their hulls underwater while maintaining a small platform above the water surface. These craft can find use for both naval operations and civil transportation due to special properties, including the low above-water hull profile, reduced wave drag in some speed regimes, and potentially better seaworthiness. However, hydrodynamics of these marine craft is not well studied. In this work, computational modeling is undertaken to explore steady hydrodynamic characteristics of several semi-submersible hull variations in a range of speeds in deep-water and finite-depth conditions. The validation and verification study is conducted using experimental data obtained with a Suboff model in a near-surface regime. Parametric simulations are performed for this hull and two others generated by modifying the original Suboff geometry to produce narrow and wide hull shapes with similar volumes. The computational results indicate that the narrow hull excels in deep water, having lower drag and experiencing lower downward suction force and smaller longitudinal moment. However, in shallow-water operations, the narrow hull exhibits noticeably larger resistance than other hulls with the same displacement due to smaller gap between the hull and sea floor. Main hydrodynamic characteristics of the studied hulls and illustrations of wave patterns are presented in the paper. These findings can be useful for designers of semi-submersible vehicles.</description>

      <title>Transport and mixing in control volumes through the lens of probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partial differential equation governing the global evolution of the joint probability distribution of an arbitrary number of local flow observations, drawn randomly from a control volume, is derived and applied to examples involving irreversible mixing. Unlike local probability density methods, this work adopts a global integral perspective by regarding a control volume as the sample space. Doing so enables the divergence theorem to be used to expose contributions made by uncertain or stochastic boundary fluxes and internal cross-gradient mixing in the equation governing the joint probability distribution's evolution. Advection and diffusion across the control volume's boundary result in source and drift terms, respectively, whereas internal mixing, in general, corresponds to the sign-indefinite diffusion of probability density. Several typical circumstances for which the corresponding diffusion coefficient is negative semidefinite are identified and discussed in detail. The global joint probability perspective is the natural setting for available potential energy and the incorporation of uncertainty into bulk, volume integrated, models of transport and mixing. Finer-grained information in space can be readily obtained by treating coordinate functions as observables. By extension, the framework can be applied to networks of interacting control volumes of arbitrary size.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of coexisting turbulent and rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating complex gas flows from turbulent to rarefied regimes is a long-standing challenge, since turbulence and rarefied flow represent contrasting extremes of computational aerodynamics. We propose a multiscale method to bridge this gap. Our method builds upon the general synthetic iterative scheme for the mesoscopic Boltzmann equation, and integrates the $k$-$\omega$ model in the macroscopic synthetic equation to address turbulent effects. We have not only validated this approach using the experimental data of turbulent flows, but also confirmed that the turbulence model exerts no undue influence on highly rarefied flows. Our method is then applied to opposing jet problems in hypersonic flight surrounding by rarefied gas flows, showing that the turbulence could cause significant impacts on the surface heat flux, which cannot be captured by the turbulent model nor the laminar Boltzmann solution alone. This study provides a viable framework for advancing our understanding of the interaction between turbulent and rarefied gas flows.</description>

      <title>A modern approach to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on circular vortex sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent the outermost shear interface of an eddy by a circular vortex sheet in two dimensions, and provide a new proof of linear instability via the Birkhoff-Rott equation. Like planar vortex sheets, circular sheets are found to be susceptible to a violent short-wave instability known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, with some modifications due to vortex sheet geometry. This result is in agreement with the classical derivation of (Moore 1974, Saffman 1992), but our modern approach provides greater clarity. We go on to show that the linear evolution problem can develop a singularity from analytic initial data in a time proportional to the square of the vortex sheet radius. Numerical evidence is presented that suggests this linear instability captures the wave-breaking mechanism observed in nonlinear point vortex simulations. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can contribute to the development of secondary instability for eddies in two-dimensional turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of Spatiotemporal Instabilities in Discontinuous Shear Thickening Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST) fluids exhibit unique instability properties in a wide range of flow conditions. We present numerical simulations of a scalar model for DST fluids in a planar simple shear using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach. The model reproduces the spatially homogeneous instability mechanism based on the competition between the inertial and microstructural timescales, with good congruence to the theoretical predictions. Spatial inhomogeneities arising from a stress-splitting instability are rationalised within the context of local components of the microstructure evolution. Using this effect, the addition of non-locality in the model is found to produce an alternative mechanism of temporal instabilities, driven by the inhomogeneous pattern formation. The reported arrangement of the microstructure is generally in agreement with the experimental data on gradient pattern formation in DST. Simulations in a parameter space representative of realistic DST materials resulted in aperiodic oscillations in measured shear rate and stress, driven by formation of gap-spanning frictional structures.</description>

      <title>Regimes of rotating convection in an experimental model of the Earth's tangent cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's fast rotation imposes the Taylor-Proudman Constraint that opposes fluid motion across an imaginary cylindrical surface called the Tangent Cylinder (TC) obtained by extruding the equatorial perimeter of the solid inner core along the rotation direction, and up to the core-mantle boundary (CMB). To date however, the influence of this boundary is unknown and this impedes our understanding of the flow in the polar regions of the core. We reproduce the TC geometry experimentally, where the CMB is modelled as a cold, cylindrical vessel, with a hot cylinder inside it acting as the inner solid core. The vessel is filled with water so as to optically map the velocity field in regimes of criticality and rotational constraint consistent with those of the Earth. We find that the main new mechanism arises out of the baroclinicity near the cold lateral boundary of the vessel, which drives inertia at the outer boundary of the TC, as convection in the equatorial regions of the Earth's core does. The baroclinicity just outside the TC suppresses the classical wall modes found in solid cylinder and the inertia there causes an early breakup of the TPC at the TC boundary. The flow remains dominated by the Coriolis force even up to criticality $\Rt=191$, but because of inertia near the TC boundary, geostrophic turbulence appears at much lower criticality than in other settings. The heat flux escapes increasingly through the TC boundary as the TPC becomes weaker. Hence inertia driven by baroclinicity outside the TC provides a convenient shortcut to geostrophic turbulence, which is otherwise difficult to reach in experiments. These results also highlight a process whereby the convection outside the TC may control turbulence inside it and bypass the axial heat transfer. We finally discuss how Earth's conditions, especially its magnetic field may change how this process acts within the Earth's core.</description>

      <title>Using Symmetries to Investigate the Complete Integrability, Solitary Wave Solutions and Solitons of the Gardner Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a scaling symmetry, it is shown how to compute polynomial conservation laws, generalized symmetries, recursion operators, Lax pairs, and bilinear forms of polynomial nonlinear partial differential equations thereby establishing their complete integrability. The Gardner equation is chosen as the key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which connect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling homogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation are derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these solutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the underlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large amplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative (defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard elastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of integrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate the applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms used in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for major computer algebra systems.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Horizontal Shear on Extracting Water Currents From Surface Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersive motion of surface waves is now routinely used to remotely measure the currents close beneath the surface of oceans and other natural flows. The current manifests as wavelength-dependent Doppler shifts in the spatiotemporal wave spectrum, which is obtained by performing a Fourier transform of an observed wave field, a procedure which assumes that the current is horizontally uniform within the field of view. This assumption is frequently not satisfied. We here analyze the effects of the presence of horizontal shear in the velocity field, with special emphasis on biases: ``measured'' velocities which differ systematically in magnitude and/or direction compared to the average current within the field of view. We generate random synthetic wave data according to a spectrum prescribed at the domain center while varying the current and its gradient, and the mean direction $\theta_0$ and angular spread of the waves' propagation direction, from which we extract Doppler shift velocities (DSVs) using one of the most common numerical schemes. Assuming currents vary by up to 10\% of a characteristic wave phase velocity across the field of view, we find that strong biases can occur for highly directional wave spectra, strongly dependent on $\theta_0$ and the current direction relative to that of its magnitude gradient. We discuss how biases arise in the DSV extraction procedure and suggest practical steps to discover the presence of biases.</description>

      <title>Local divergence-free velocity interpolation for the immersed boundary method using composite B-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to improve volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. These delta functions employ tensor product kernels using B-splines, whose polynomial degrees vary in normal and tangential directions based on the corresponding velocity component. Our method addresses the long-standing volume conservation issues in the conventional IB method, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances volume conservation, rivaling the performance of the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method introduced by Bao et al. while maintaining the local nature of the classical IB method. This avoids the computational overhead associated with the DFIB method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves. Numerical experiments show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels can maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We analyze the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with volume conservation errors primarily dominated by the time-stepping scheme's truncation error. This work offers a computationally efficient alternative for improving volume conservation in IB methods, particularly beneficial for large-scale, three-dimensional simulations. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Arrested on heating: controlling the motility of active droplets by temperature</title>

Abstract: Self-propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, we present an experimental system of self-propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the P\'eclet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which we can now tune by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. We quantify the droplet dynamics by analysing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, we experimentally observe, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self-propelled motility.</description>

      <title>Universal Translational and Rotational Mobility Expressions of Phoretic and Self-phoretic Particles with Arbitrary Interaction Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mobility of externally-driven phoretic propulsion of particles is evaluated by simultaneously solving the solute conservation equation, interaction potential equation, and the modified Stokes equation. While accurate, this approach is cumbersome, especially when the interaction potential decays slowly compared to the particle size. In contrast to external phoresis, the motion of self-phoretic particles is typically estimated by relating the translation and rotation velocities with the local slip velocity. While this approach is convenient and thus widely used, it is only valid when the interaction decay length is significantly smaller than the particle size. Here, by taking inspiration from Brady J. Fluid Mech. (2021), vol. 922, A10, which combines the benefits of two approaches, we reproduce their unified mobility expressions with arbitrary interaction potentials and show that these expressions can conveniently recover the well-known mobility relationships of external electrophoresis and diffusiophoresis for arbitrary double-layer thickness. Additionally, we show that for a spherical microswimmer, the derived expressions relax to the slip velocity calculations in the limit of the thin interaction lengthscales. We also employ the derived mobility expressions to calculate the velocities of an autophoretic Janus particle. We find that there is significant dampening in the translation velocity even when the interaction length is an order of magnitude larger than the particle size. Finally, we study the motion of a catalytically self-propelled particle, while it also propels due to external concentration gradients, and demonstrate how the two propulsion modes compete with each other.</description>

      <title>Experimental Insights into Droplet Behavior on Van der Waals and Non-Van der Waals Liquid-Impregnated Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet impact is a fascinating phenomenon that occurs when a liquid droplet collides with a surface. It is not only a fundamental area of scientific inquiry but also has practical implications across many industries and natural systems. The dynamics during droplet impact on liquid-impregnated surfaces are of special interest because the properties of the surface and impregnated liquid may significantly change the impact outcome. We present a detailed study of the impact and subsequent retraction of liquid droplets on a liquid-impregnated surface using high-speed imagery. Square-shaped textures with varying post-spacings of 5, 20, and 30 um on a silicon wafer were fabricated and functionalised using octadecyl trichlorosilane. Two different lubricants, silicone oil and hexadecane, were infused to investigate how their properties affect impact dynamics. Droplet impacts were investigated on these surfaces across a broad range of Weber numbers (28-495). Additionally, we measured the stability of the LIS surface by calculating spreading coefficients and contact angles. The experiments revealed that the properties of the infused oil play an insignificant role in droplet dynamics, including spreading, rebound, and unique phenomena related to oil interaction with surface textures. This study provides insights into the intricate dynamics of droplet interactions with LIS, offering valuable contributions to understanding surface-wetting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Effect of a shear flow on the Darrieus-Landau instability in a Hele-Shaw channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Darrieus--Landau instability of premixed flames propagating in a narrow Hele-Shaw channel in the presence of a strong shear flow is investigated, incorporating also the Rayleigh--Taylor and diffusive-thermal instabilities. The flow induces shear-enhanced diffusion (Taylor dispersion) in the streamwise direction, but not in the spanwise direction and this leads to anisotropic diffusion and flame propagation. To understand how such anisotropies affect flame stability, two important cases are considered. These correspond to initial unperturbed conditions pertaining to a planar flame propagating in the streamwise or spanwise directions. The analysis is based on a two-dimensional model derived by asymptotic methods and solved numerically. These address the influence of the shear-flow strength (or Peclet number $Pe$), preferential diffusion (or Lewis number $Le$) and gravity (or Rayleigh number $Ra$). Dispersion curves characterizing the perturbation growth rate are computed for selected values of $Pe$, $Le$ and $Ra$. Taylor dispersion induced by strong shear flows is found to suppress the Darrieus--Landau instability and to weaken the flame wrinkling when the flame propagates in the streamwise direction. In contrast, when the flame propagates in the spanwise direction, the flame is stabilized in $Le&lt;1$ mixtures, but destabilized in $Le&gt;1$ mixtures. In the latter case, Taylor dispersion coupled with gas expansion facilitates flame wrinkling in an unusual manner. Specifically, stagnation points and counter-rotating vortices are encountered in the flame close to the unburnt gas side. More generally, an original finding is the demonstration that vorticity can be produced by a curved flame in a Hele-Shaw channel even in the absence of gravity, whenever $Pe \neq 0$, and that the vorticity remains confined to the flame preheat and reaction zones.</description>

      <title>Mixed Convection and Entropy Generation Analysis of Carbon Nanotube-Water Nanofluid in a Square Cavity with Cylinders and Flow Deflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the mixed convection of carbon nanotube (CNT)-water nanofluid within a square cavity containing heated cylinders under the influence of a magnetic field, focusing on three geometric configurations: a single heated cylinder, two heated cylinders, and two heated cylinders with a flow deflector. The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number, Richardson number, Hartmann number, wavy wall peaks, nanoparticle volume fraction, Hartmann angle, rotational speed, and inclination angle, on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. Results reveal that multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanofluids consistently achieve higher Nusselt numbers than single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) nanofluids, indicating superior heat transfer capabilities. Introducing a second cylinder and a flow deflector enhances thermal interactions, while increasing Ha stabilizes the flow, improving thermal performance. Wavy wall peaks further enhance fluid mixing and heat transfer efficiency. Additionally, SWCNT nanofluids exhibit higher Bejan numbers, indicating a greater dominance of thermal entropy generation over fluid friction. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.</description>

Abstract: The ratio of the Lowes spectrum and the secular variation spectrum measured at the Earth's surface provides a time scale $\tau_{\rm sv}(l)$ as a function of spherical harmonic degree $l$. $\tau_{\rm sv}$ is often assumed to be representative of time scales related to the dynamo inside the outer core and its scaling with $l$ is debated. To assess the validity of this surmise and to study the time variation of the geomagnetic field $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ inside the outer core, we introduce a magnetic time-scale spectrum $\tau(l,r)$ that is valid for all radius $r$ above the inner core and reduces to the usual $\tau_{\rm sv}$ at and above the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We study $\tau$ in a numerical geodynamo model. Focusing on the large scales, we find that $\tau \sim l^{-1}$ at the CMB. Just below the CMB, $\tau$ undergo a sharp transition such that the scaling becomes shallower than $l^{-1}$. This transition stems from the magnetic boundary condition at the CMB that ties all three components of $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ together. In the interior of the outer core, the time variation of the horizontal magnetic field, which dominates $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$, has no such constraint. The upshot is $\tau_{\rm sv}$ becomes unreliable in estimating time scales inside the outer core. Another question concerning $\tau$ is whether a scaling argument based on the frozen-flux hypothesis can be used to explain its scaling. To investigate this, we analyse the induction equation in the spectral space. We find that away from both boundaries, the magnetic diffusion term is negligible in the power spectrum of $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$. However, $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ is controlled by the radial derivative in the induction term, thus invalidating the frozen-flux argument. Near the CMB, magnetic diffusion starts to affect $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ rendering the frozen-flux hypothesis inapplicable.</description>

      <title>All-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume-temperature equation of state of fluids in the diamond anvil cell</title>

Abstract: We have developed a new all-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) equation of state (EOS) of fluids and transparent solids in the diamond anvil high pressure cell by measuring the volume of the sample chamber. Our method combines confocal microscopy and white light interference with a new analysis method which exploits the mutual dependence of sample density and refractive index: Experimentally, the refractive index determines the measured sample chamber thickness (and therefore the measured sample volume/density), yet the sample density is by far the dominant factor in determining the variation in refractive index with pressure. Our analysis method allows us to obtain a set of values for the density and refractive index which are mutually consistent, and agree with the experimental data within error. We have conducted proof-of-concept experiments on a variety of samples (H$_{2}$O, CH$_{4}$, C$_{2}$H$_{6}$, C$_{3}$H$_{8}$, KCl and NaCl) at ambient temperature, and at high temperatures up to just above 500 K. Our proof-of-concept data demonstrate that our method is able to reproduce known fluid and solid EOS within error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method allows us to directly and routinely measure the PVT EOS of simple fluids at GPa pressures up to, at least, 514 K (the highest temperature reached in our study). A reasonable estimation of the known sources of error in our volume determinations indicates that the error is currently $\pm$ 2.7% at high temperature, and that it is feasible to reduce it to ca. $\pm$ 1% in future work.</description>

      <title>Kinetic representation of the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle method and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is a hybrid method for multiscale flow simulations, in which the contributions to the whole gas evolution from deterministic hydrodynamic wave and stochastic particle transport are combined simultaneously. Originally, the UGKWP method was developed as a direct modeling approach at discrete level. In this work, we revisit the time evolution of each part of the involved simulation particles and wave molecules in UGKWP, and present the corresponding kinetic equations. The resultant kinetic system can be viewed as a collision decomposition of the original kinetic equation, which can serve as a basis for developing other kinetic methods for flows in all flow regimes.</description>
