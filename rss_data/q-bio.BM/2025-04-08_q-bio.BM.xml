      <title>Prot42: a Novel Family of Protein Language Models for Target-aware Protein Binder Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlocking the next generation of biotechnology and therapeutic innovation demands overcoming the inherent complexity and resource-intensity of conventional protein engineering methods. Recent GenAI-powered computational techniques often rely on the availability of the target protein's 3D structures and specific binding sites to generate high-affinity binders, constraints exhibited by models such as AlphaProteo and RFdiffusion. In this work, we explore the use of Protein Language Models (pLMs) for high-affinity binder generation. We introduce Prot42, a novel family of Protein Language Models (pLMs) pretrained on vast amounts of unlabeled protein sequences. By capturing deep evolutionary, structural, and functional insights through an advanced auto-regressive, decoder-only architecture inspired by breakthroughs in natural language processing, Prot42 dramatically expands the capabilities of computational protein design based on language only. Remarkably, our models handle sequences up to 8,192 amino acids, significantly surpassing standard limitations and enabling precise modeling of large proteins and complex multi-domain sequences. Demonstrating powerful practical applications, Prot42 excels in generating high-affinity protein binders and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Our innovative models are publicly available, offering the scientific community an efficient and precise computational toolkit for rapid protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern drug pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</description>
