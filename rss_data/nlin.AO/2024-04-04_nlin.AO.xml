      <title>Evolutionary game on any hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation plays a fundamental role in societal and biological domains, and the population structure profoundly shapes the dynamics of evolution. Practically, individuals behave either altruistically or egoistically in multiple groups, such as relatives, friends and colleagues, and feedbacks from these groupwise interactions will contribute to one's cognition and behavior. Due to the intricacy within and between groups, exploration of evolutionary dynamics over hypergraphs is relatively limited to date. To uncover this conundrum, we develop a higher-order random walk framework for five distinct updating rules, thus establishing explicit conditions for cooperation emergence on hypergraphs, and finding the overlaps between groups tend to foster cooperative behaviors. Our systematic analysis quantifies how the order and hyperdegree govern evolutionary outcomes. We also discover that whenever following a group wisdom update protocol, choosing a high-fitness group to interact equally within its members, cooperators will significantly prevail throughout the community. These findings underscore a crucial role of higher-order interaction and interdisciplinary collaboration throughout a broad range of living systems, favoring social prosperity.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary theory of convective organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed patterns of convective cloud would be extremely improbable from random walks in an abstract space of configurations. Forcing is sometimes the driver, but complexity can also develop spontaneously. Here pattern evolution is considered as a natural selection process in a strategic game among configurations, akin to ecological succession. Information (entropy) quantifies improbability, interpreted as Darwinian fitness to the extent larger-scale forcings are properly accounted. Reconciling inferred or revealed fitness with energetics could make convection a showcase of evolutionary theory, simply as reinterpretation of spectral kinetic energy (KE) budgets for dry convection. For moist convection, the flux of a total energy E, the teleological reason for convection, is conjectured to be the central resource of an evolutionary game, with water playing a constraining role like nutrients in ecology. Shannon information H is reviewed in context of this evolutionary reasoning. Analysis of a new Cloud Botany shallow convection simulation set shows growth of H over tens of hours (perhaps more pertinently, it grows with KE throughput or cumulative buoyancy flux). Anisotropy and precipitation boost H in qualitatively distinct and contingent ways, like separate species or ecological guilds. Deep convection over lowland South America also shows many-hour evolution times, beyond simple convective adjustment notions. If evolving horizontal patterns contain or imply information about vertical density profiles, they could become a new resource in data assimilation to predict larger scale flow.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy Selection: New team ranking indicators for cyclist multi-stage races</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I report some investigation discussing team selection, whence hierarchy, through ranking indicators, for example when measuring professional cyclist team's sportive value, in particular in multistage races. A logical, it seems, constraint is introduced on the riders: they must finish the race. Several new indicators are defined, justified, and compared. These indicators are mainly based on the arriving place of (the best 3) riders instead of their time needed for finishing the stage or the race, - as presently classically used. A case study, serving as an illustration containing the necessary ingredients for a wider discussion, is the 2023 Vuelta de San Juan, but without loss of generality.
  It is shown that the new indicators offer some new viewpoint for distinguishing the ranking through the cumulative sums of the places of riders rather than their finishing times. On the other hand, the indicators indicate a different team hierarchy if only the finishing riders are considered. Some consideration on the distance between ranking indicators is presented.
  Moreover, it is argued that these new ranking indicators should hopefully promote more competitive races, not only till the end of the race, but also until the end of each stage. Generalizations and other applications within operational research topics, like in academia, are suggested.</description>

      <title>Complexity Heliophysics: A lived and living history of systems and complexity science in Heliophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review examines complexity science in Heliophysics, describing it not as a discipline, but as a paradigm. In the context of Heliophysics, complexity science is the study of a star, interplanetary environment, magnetosphere, upper and terrestrial atmospheres, and planetary surface as interacting subsystems. Complexity science studies entities in a system (e.g., electrons in an atom, planets in a solar system, individuals in a society) and their interactions, and is the nature of what emerges from these interactions. It is a paradigm that employs systems approaches and is inherently multi- and cross-scale. Heliophysics processes span at least 15 orders of magnitude in space and another 15 in time, and its reaches go well beyond our own solar system and Earth's space environment to touch planetary, exoplanetary, and astrophysical domains. It is an uncommon domain within which to explore complexity science.
  This review article excavates the lived and living history of complexity science in Heliophysics. It identifies five dimensions of complexity science. It then proceeds in three epochal parts: 1) A pivotal year in the Complexity Heliophysics paradigm: 1996; 2) The transitional years that established foundations of the paradigm (1996-2010); and 3) The emergent literature largely beyond 2010.
  The history reveals a grand challenge that confronts most physical sciences to understand the research intersection between fundamental science (e.g., complexity science) and applied science (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). A risk science framework is suggested as a way of formulating the challenges in a way that the two converge.
  The intention is to provide inspiration and guide future research. It will be instructive to Heliophysics researchers, but also to any reader interested in or hoping to advance the frontier of systems and complexity science.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibria of the spatially inhomogeneous Vicsek-BGK equation across a bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek-BGK equation is a kinetic model for alignment of particles moving with constant speed between stochastic reorientation events with sampling from a von Mises distribution. The spatially homogeneous model shows a steady state bifurcation with exchange of stability. The main result of this work is an extension of the bifurcation result to the spatially inhomogeneous problem under the additional assumption of a sufficiently large Knudsen number, which is shown to be necessary. A counterexample is derived in the form of an exponentially increasing travelling wave solution of the linearized equation, indicating a possible explanation of traveling bands, which have been observed in the literature in simulations with an individual based model. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation. The bifurcation result includes global existence of smooth solutions for close-to-equilibrium initial data. For large data smooth solutions might blow up in finite time whereas weak solutions with bounded Boltzmann entropy are shown to exist globally.</description>
