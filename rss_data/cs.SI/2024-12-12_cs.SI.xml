      <title>Rumor Detection on Social Media with Temporal Propagation Structure Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for detecting rumors on social media primarily focus on analyzing textual content, often struggling to capture the complexity of online interactions. Recent research has shifted towards leveraging graph neural networks to model the hierarchical conversation structure that emerges during rumor propagation. However, these methods tend to overlook the temporal aspect of rumor propagation and may disregard potential noise within the propagation structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates temporal information by constructing a weighted propagation tree, where the weight of each edge represents the time interval between connected posts. Drawing upon the theory of structural entropy, we transform this tree into a coding tree. This transformation aims to preserve the essential structure of rumor propagation while reducing noise. Finally, we introduce a recursive neural network to learn from the coding tree for rumor veracity prediction. Experimental results on two common datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning via Large Language Models: A Generalized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Two-way Node Popularity Model for Directed and Bipartite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been extensive research on community detection in directed and bipartite networks. However, these studies often fail to consider the popularity of nodes in different communities, which is a common phenomenon in real-world networks. To address this issue, we propose a new probabilistic framework called the Two-Way Node Popularity Model (TNPM). The TNPM also accommodates edges from different distributions within a general sub-Gaussian family. We introduce the Delete-One-Method (DOM) for model fitting and community structure identification, and provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis with novel technical skills dealing with sub-Gaussian generalization. Additionally, we propose the Two-Stage Divided Cosine Algorithm (TSDC) to handle large-scale networks more efficiently. Our proposed methods offer multi-folded advantages in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, as demonstrated through extensive numerical studies. We apply our methods to two real-world applications, uncovering interesting findings.</description>

      <title>Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</description>

      <title>Social Recommendation through Heterogeneous Graph Modeling of the Long-term and Short-term Preference Defined by Dynamic Time Spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social recommendations have been widely adopted in substantial domains. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been employed in recommender systems due to their success in graph representation learning. However, dealing with the dynamic property of social network data is a challenge. This research presents a novel method that provides social recommendations by incorporating the dynamic property of social network data in a heterogeneous graph. The model aims to capture user preference over time without going through the complexities of a dynamic graph by adding period nodes to define users' long-term and short-term preferences and aggregating assigned edge weights. The model is applied to real-world data to argue its superior performance. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-centric Machine Learning on Directed Graphs: a Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advances in processing structured data. However, most of them primarily adopted a model-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting them into undirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently limited in real-world applications due to the unavoidable information loss in simple undirected graphs and the model optimization challenges that arise when exceeding the upper bounds of this sub-optimal data representational capacity. As a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize improving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of graphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer distinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships, and directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a comprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular focus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel taxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from the data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving data representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed graphs and their quality plays a crucial role in model performance. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+ domains, highlighting their broad applicability. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges within the field, offering insights that can guide future research and development in directed graph learning.</description>
