      <title>Orbits in the integrable H\'enon-Heiles systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the form of the orbits in integrable generalized H\'enon-Heiles systems with Hamiltonians of the form $H = \frac{1}{2}(\dot{x}^2 + Ax^2 + \dot{y}^2 + By^2) + \epsilon(xy^2 + \alpha x^3).$ In particular, we focus on the invariant curves on Poincar\'e surfaces of section ($ y = 0$) and the corresponding orbits on the $x-y$ plane. We provide a detailed analysis of the transition from bounded to escaping orbits in each integrable system case, highlighting the mechanism behind the escape to infinity. Then, we investigate the form of the non-escaping orbits, conducting a comparative analysis across various integrable cases and physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Bohmian Chaos and Entanglement in a Two-Qubit System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the critical points of Bohmian flow, both in the inertial frame of reference (Y-points) and in the frames centered at the moving nodal points of the guiding wavefunction (X-points), and analyze their role in the onset of chaos in a system of two entangled qubits. We find the distances between these critical points and a moving Bohmian particle at varying levels of entanglement, with particular emphasis on the times at which chaos arises. Then, we find why some trajectories are ordered, without any chaos. Finally, we examine numerically how the Lyapunov Characteristic Number (LCN ) depends on the degree of quantum entanglement. Our results indicate that increasing entanglement reduces the convergence time of the finite-time LCN of the chaotic trajectories toward its final positive value.</description>

      <title>Computational modeling of diffusive dynamics in a bouncer system with an irregular surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The horizontal dynamics of a bouncing ball interacting with an irregular surface is investigated and is found to demonstrate behavior analogous to a random walk. Its stochastic character is substantiated by the calculation of a permutation entropy. The probability density function associated with the particle positions evolves to a Gaussian distribution, and the second moment follows a power-law dependence on time, indicative of diffusive behavior. The results emphasize that deterministic systems with complex geometries or nonlinearities can generate behavior that is statistically indistinguishable from random. Several problems are suggested to extend the analysis.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits underlying spatiotemporal chaos in the Lugiato-Lefever model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain and investigate theoretically a broad family of stable and unstable time-periodic orbits-oscillating Turing rolls (OTR)-in the Lugiato-Lefever model of optical cavities. Using the dynamical systems tools developed in fluid dynamics, we access the OTR solution branches in parameter space and elucidate their bifurcation structure. By tracking these exact invariant solutions deeply into the chaotic region of the modulation instability, we connect the main dynamical regimes of the Lugiato-Lefever model: continuous waves, Turing rolls, solitons, and breathers, which completes the classical phase diagram of the optical cavity. We then demonstrate that the OTR periodic orbits play a fundamental role as elementary building blocks in the regime of the intracavity field transition from stable Turing rolls to fully developed turbulent regimes. Depending on the cavity size, we observe that the chaotic intracavity field driven by modulation instability displays either spatiotemporal or purely temporal intermittancy between chaotic dynamics and different families of the OTR solutions, exhibiting locally the distinctive wave patterns and large amplitude peaks. This opens avenues for a theoretical description of optical turbulence within the dynamical systems framework.</description>

      <title>Topological gravity for arbitrary Dyson index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the well established duality of topological gravity to a double scaled matrix model with the Airy spectral curve to define what we refer to as topological gravity with arbitrary Dyson index $\upbeta$ ($\upbeta$ topological gravity). On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index between the Wigner-Dyson classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as interpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the gravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space volumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we study correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural properties, having clear implications on the generalised moduli space volumes. Additionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like recursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate whether $\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the BGS conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the last Wigner-Dyson class not studied in the literature, the symplectic one, and establish strong evidence for quantum chaos for this variety of the theory, and thus for all bosonic varieties of topological gravity. For the general $\upbeta$ case we also argue for the case of quantum chaoticity, based on novel constraints we find to be obeyed by genuinely non Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space volumes. As for the general $\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected from a chaotic system is not known analytically we give first steps how to obtain it, starting with the result of $\upbeta$ topological gravity and comparing then to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.</description>
