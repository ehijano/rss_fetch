      <title>Membership Queries for Convex Floating Bodies via Hilbert Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the convex floating body membership problem, which consists of efficiently determining when a query point $a\in\mathbb{R}^d$ belongs to the so-called $\varepsilon$-convex floating body of a given bounded convex domain $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. We consider this problem in an approximate setting, i.e., given a parameter $\delta&gt;0$, the query can be answered either way if the Hilbert distance in $K$ of $a$ from the boundary of a relatively-scaled $\varepsilon$-convex floating body is less than $\delta$. We present a data structure for this problem that has storage size $O(\delta^{-d}\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ and achieves query time of $O({\delta^{-1}}\ln 1/\varepsilon)$. Our construction is motivated by a recent work of Abdelkader and Mount on APM queries, and relies on a comparison of convex floating bodies with balls in the Hilbert metric on $K$.</description>

      <title>On $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the concepts of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips simplicial set and the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips complex of a metric space, where $1\leq p \leq \infty.$ This theory unifies two established theories: for $p=\infty,$ this is the classical theory of Vietoris-Rips complexes, and for $p=1,$ this corresponds to the blurred magnitude homology theory. We prove several results that are known for the Vietoris-Rips complex in the general case: (1) we prove a stability theorem for the corresponding version of the persistent homology; (2) we show that, for a compact Riemannian manifold and a sufficiently small scale parameter, all the "$\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces" are homotopy equivalent to the manifold; (3) we demonstrate that the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces are invariant (up to homotopy) under taking the metric completion. Additionally, we show that the limit of the homology groups of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces, as the scale parameter tends to zero, does not depend on $p$; and that the homology groups of the $\ell_p$-Vietoris-Rips spaces commute with filtered colimits of metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Facet-Hamiltonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider facet-Hamiltonian cycles of polytopes, defined as cycles in their skeleton such that every facet is visited exactly once. These cycles can be understood as optimal watchman routes that guard the facets of a polytope. We consider the existence of such cycles for a variety of polytopes, the facets of which have a natural combinatorial interpretation. In particular, we prove the following results:
  - Every permutahedron has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle. These cycles consist of circular sequences of permutations of $n$ elements, where two successive permutations differ by a single adjacent transposition, and such that every subset of $[n]$ appears as a prefix in a contiguous subsequence. With these cycles we associate what we call rhombic strips which encode interleaved Gray codes of the Boolean lattice, one Gray code for each rank. These rhombic strips correspond to simple Venn diagrams.
  - Every generalized associahedron has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle. This generalizes the so-called rainbow cycles of Felsner, Kleist, M\"utze, and Sering (SIDMA 2020) to associahedra of any finite type. We relate the constructions to the Conway-Coxeter friezes and the bipartite belts of finite type cluster algebras.
  - Graph associahedra of wheels, fans, and complete split graphs have facet-Hamiltonian cycles. For associahedra of complete bipartite graphs and caterpillars, we construct facet-Hamiltonian paths. The construction involves new insights on the combinatorics of graph tubings.
  We also consider the computational complexity of deciding whether a given polytope has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle and show that the problem is NP-complete, even when restricted to simple 3-dimensional polytopes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithm for the Planar Two-Center Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08784v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a fundamental problem in Computational Geometry, the planar two-center problem. In this problem, the input is a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane and the goal is to find two smallest congruent disks whose union contains all points of $S$. A longstanding open problem has been to obtain an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm for planar two-center, matching the $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound given by Eppstein [SODA'97]. Towards this, researchers have made a lot of efforts over decades. The previous best algorithm, given by Wang [SoCG'20], solves the problem in $O(n\log^2 n)$ time. In this paper, we present an $O(n\log n)$-time (deterministic) algorithm for planar two-center, which completely resolves this open problem.</description>

      <title>Online Duet between Metric Embeddings and Minimum-Weight Perfect Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-distortional metric embeddings are a crucial component in the modern algorithmic toolkit. In an online metric embedding, points arrive sequentially and the goal is to embed them into a simple space irrevocably, while minimizing the distortion. Our first result is a deterministic online embedding of a general metric into Euclidean space with distortion $O(\log n)\cdot\min\{\sqrt{\log\Phi},\sqrt{n}\}$ (or, $O(d)\cdot\min\{\sqrt{\log\Phi},\sqrt{n}\}$ if the metric has doubling dimension $d$), solving a conjecture by Newman and Rabinovich (2020), and quadratically improving the dependence on the aspect ratio $\Phi$ from Indyk et al.\ (2010). Our second result is a stochastic embedding of a metric space into trees with expected distortion $O(d\cdot \log\Phi)$, generalizing previous results (Indyk et al.\ (2010), Bartal et al.\ (2020)).
  Next, we study the \emph{online minimum-weight perfect matching} problem, where a sequence of $2n$ metric points arrive in pairs, and one has to maintain a perfect matching at all times. We allow recourse (as otherwise the order of arrival determines the matching). The goal is to return a perfect matching that approximates the \emph{minimum-weight} perfect matching at all times, while minimizing the recourse. Our third result is a randomized algorithm with competitive ratio $O(d\cdot \log \Phi)$ and recourse $O(\log \Phi)$ against an oblivious adversary, this result is obtained via our new stochastic online embedding. Our fourth result is a deterministic algorithm against an adaptive adversary, using $O(\log^2 n)$ recourse, that maintains a matching of weight at most $O(\log n)$ times the weight of the MST, i.e., a matching of lightness $O(\log n)$. We complement our upper bounds with a strategy for an oblivious adversary that, with recourse $r$, establishes a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{\log n}{r \log r})$ for both competitive ratio and lightness.</description>
