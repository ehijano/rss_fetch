      <title>Low energy resolvent estimates for slowly decaying attractive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the low energy resolvent estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator with slowly decaying attractive potential. The main results are Rellich's theorem, the limiting absorption principle and Sommerfeld's uniqueness theorem. For the proofs we employ an elementary commutator method due to Ito--Skibsted, for which neither of microlocal or functional-analytic techniques is required.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability via the KP Hierarchy for $\beta=L^2$ Random Matrix Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random matrix ensembles with Dyson index $\beta=L^{2}$ describe systems of $M$ charge-$L$ particles interacting logarithmically in the presence of an external potential, yet exact formulas for their physical observables have remained elusive for $L\neq 1,2$. We show that, for $L$ even, $\beta=L^{2}$ ensembles are governed by the KP hierarchy at finite particle number--paralleling the KP solvability of classical $\beta=1,2,4$ ensembles. The partition function is a hyperpfaffian $\tau$-function satisfying the Hirota bilinear identity, and correlation functions are generated by finite-order differential operators acting on this $\tau$-function. The key mechanism is an emergent quantized momentum that stratifies the system into discrete sectors, enforcing momentum conservation as a selection rule. This produces a dramatic dimensional reduction from ${LM\choose L}$ to $O(L^{2}M)$, enabling explicit computation of physical observables.</description>

      <title>A Globally Convergent Method for Finding the Number of Intrinsic Modes on Narrow-Banded Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) plays an important role in many scientific areas, especially for the area of signal processing. Unlike the traditional Fourier paradigm, it makes decomposition of a signal possible without any predefined function basis, which gives unprecedented flexibilities while handling narrow-banded signals of varieties. However, determining the number and central frequencies of intrinsic mode functions are still open questions in that few studies has been proposed to give a complete method that can theoretically guarantee the global convergence during decomposition. In this article, we propose a globally convergent numerical optimization method based on variational convex optimization to automatically determine the number and central frequency of IMFs without any prior knowledge for narrow banded signals, as long as the spectra of each sub-band are identifiable. Our method focuses on finding the support baseline of the spectral function, and further separating the significant frequency band regions above the support baseline. Unlike pioneer works that focus on optimizations on complex field, our method achieves obtaining the number of decomposed IMFs and center frequencies in real field by combining variational calculus, convex optimization, and numerical solutions of differential equations in real field and theoretical analysis shows our algorithm is guaranteed terminate to one of the optimum as close as possible. Experiments also shows that our algorithm converges quickly and can be used in practical engineering to determine the prior information of the number of intrinsic modes and evaluate initial center frequency as prior information to continue the VMD procedure.</description>

      <title>Poisson Centralisers and Polynomial Superintegrability for Magnetic Geodesic Flows on Reductive Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a method for formulating superintegrable magnetic geodesic flows on reductive homogeneous spaces $M=G/A$, with $G$ a compact semisimple Lie group and $A$ a closed subgroup of $G$. In the twisted cotangent bundle $(T^*M,\omega_\varepsilon)$, with $\omega_\varepsilon=\omega_{\mathrm{can}}+\varepsilon\,\pi^*\omega_{\mathrm{KKS}}$ being the canonical plus Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau (KKS) forms, we build two canonical and commuting families of polynomial first integrals: one pulled back from the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ via the magnetic moment map $P$, and one pulled back from a $\mathrm{Ad}(A)$-invariant affine slice of $\mathfrak{m} \cong T_{eA}M$, where $eA$ is the identity of $G/A$. Their common image generates a reduced Poisson algebra obtained from a fiber tensor product, and the natural multiplication map into a Poisson subalgebra of polynomial functions $\mathcal{O}(T^*M) \subset C^\infty(T^*M)$ is Poisson and injective. The center of this fiber tensor product is contained in the Poisson center of the symmetric algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. In a dense regular locus, the resulting projection chain realises a superintegrable system. As examples, two $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ cases are studied (regular torus and irregular $\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{U}(2)\times \mathrm{U}(1))$ quotients), which illustrate the construction and produce explicit action-angle coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For simple Lie algebras we construct characteristic identities for split (polarized) Casimir operators in representations $T \otimes Y_n$ and $T \otimes Y_n'$, where $T$ -- defining (minimal fundamental for exceptional Lie algebras) representation, $Y_n$ -- n-Cartan powers of the adjoint representations $ad = Y_1$ and Y_n' -- special representations appeared in the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of symmetric part of $ad^{\otimes n}$. By means of these characteristic identities, we derive (for all simple Lie algebras, except $\mathfrak{e}_8$) explicit formulae for invariant projectors onto irreducible subrepresentations arose in the decomposition of $T \otimes Y_n$. These projectors and characteristic identities are written in the universal form for all simple Lie algebras (except $\mathfrak{e}_8$) in terms of Vogel parameters. Universal formulas for the dimensions of the Casimir subrepresentations appeared in the decompositions of $T \otimes Y_n$ where found.</description>

      <title>Integrability enabled computations relating to the fixed trace Laguerre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of density matrices for random quantum states lead naturally to the fixed trace Laguerre ensemble in random matrix theory. Previous studies have uncovered explicit rational function formulas for moments of purity statistic (trace of the squared density matrix), and also a third order linear differential equation satisfied by the eigenvalue density. We further probe the origin of these results from the viewpoint of integrability, which is taken here to mean wider classes of recursions and differential equations, and give extensions. Prominent in our study are first order linear matrix differential equations. One application given is to the derivation of the third order scalar equation for the density. Another is to obtain the explicit rational function formula for the variance of the purity statistic in the $\beta$ generalised fixed trace Laguerre ensemble. In the original case ($\beta = 2$), the purity cumulants are expressed in terms of the large argument expansion of a particular $\sigma$-Painlev\'e IV transcendent. In a different but related direction, the exact computation of the two-point correlation for the fixed determinant circular unitary ensemble SU$(N)$ is given the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Optical dispersive shock waves of initial pulses in optical fibers with high-order dispersion and quintic nonlinearity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper probes the dispersive shock waves (DSWs) theory in nonlinear optical systems through Whitham modulation theory for the high-order Chen-Lee-Liu (HOCLL) equation. We systematically derived the one-phase periodic solutions and the corresponding Whitham equations. For all feasible initial discontinuous conditions, we delineate a classification of wave structures during the evolutionary process by virtue of the initial distribution of Riemann invariants, including both convex and non-convex cases. In this classification, we find that the evolved wave structures in non-convex cases incorporate an additional and more complex region-contact DSW region, compared with those in convex cases. So we analyze the propagation behavior of this region. Additionally, we also take into account the problem that the initial wave at the instant of wave breaking approximated by the cubic root function, and elaborately analyze the propagation of photons in optical fibers under the effects of high-order dispersion and quintic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation for Reaction-Diffusion Systems with Non-Local Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of reaction diffusion processes usually employ discrete lattice models with particles interacting at the same site, resulting in localized reactions in the continuum limit. Here, various non-local interactions are considered, and two features reported. Firstly, it is shown that sufficiently non-local interactions will regulate ultra-violet divergences that perturbative methods with local interactions produce. However, in asymptotic regimes, infra-red divergences persist and ultra-violet divergences can reappear. Renormalisation methods are shown to report the same universal behaviour as local interactions at critical points. Secondly, the renormalisation group can be interpreted as a space-time-field rescaling that preserves action structure. This can be used to extract solutions to Callan-Symanzik equations directly without having to solve (or construct) the equation. These observations are exemplified for two paradigm models; annihilation $A_p+A_q\rightarrow \phi$, and this process paired with branching, birth and death.</description>

      <title>Broadband quasistatic passive cloaking: bounds and limitations in the near-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider here several aspects of the following challenging question: is it possible to use a passive cloak to make invisible a dielectric inclusion on a finite frequency interval in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations for an observer close to the object? In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks.</description>

      <title>Defect Cocycles and the Structure of Finite Process Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study positive subunital maps on ordered effect spaces and introduce the defect $d(T) = u - T(u)$, which satisfies a cocycle identity under composition. Using only this identity and elementary order-theoretic arguments -- requiring no spectral decomposition or dimension-dependent techniques -- we prove that in any finite composition-closed family of positive subunital maps, defects are eventually annihilated under iteration (Theorem 4.1), with an explicit bound linear in the family size. Under a persistence hypothesis (nonzero positive elements map to nonzero positive elements), we establish that all maps in such families must be unital. For completely positive maps on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, we then prove a sharp dimension-dependent bound: the stabilization index satisfies $n_T \le d$ where $d$ is the Hilbert space dimension, independent of the family size. This bound is achieved by a shift channel construction. These results provide a structural explanation for why finite operational repertoires in process theories cannot sustain systematic information loss, with applications to quantum foundations and categorical probability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardy Inequality for Fractional Laplacians on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fractional Hardy inequality on the integer lattice. We prove null-criticality of the Hardy weight and hence optimality of the constant. More specifically, we present a family of Hardy weights with respect to a parameter and show that below a certain threshold the Hardy weight is positive critical while above the threshold it is subcritical. In particular, the Hardy weight at the threshold is optimal in the sense that any larger weight would fail to be a Hardy weight and the Hardy inequality does not allow for a minimizer. A crucial ingredient in our proof is an asymptotic expansion of the fractional discrete Riesz kernel.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Gravitational Wave Polarization in Metric f(R) Gravity with Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully gauge invariant analysis of gravitational wave polarizations in metric f(R) gravity with a particular focus on the modified Starobinsky model, whose constant curvature solution provides a natural deSitter background for both early and late time cosmology. Linearizing the field equations around this background, we derive the Klein Gordon equation for the curvature perturbation and show that the scalar propagating mode acquires a mass, highlighting how the same scalar degree of freedom governs inflationary dynamics at high curvature and the propagation of gravitational waves in the current accelerating Universe. Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures. The resulting framework connects the extra scalar polarization to cosmological observables, providing a unified, gauge invariant link between gravitational wave phenomenology and the cosmological implications of metric f(R) gravity.</description>

      <title>Molchanov's Formula and Quantum Walks: A Probabilistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a robust link between quantum dynamics and classical ones by deriving probabilistic representation for both continuous time and discrete time quantum walks. We first adapt Molchanov formula, originally employed in the study of Schrodinger operators on multidimensional integer lattice, to characterize the evolution of continuous time quantum walks. Extending this framework, we develop a probabilistic method to represent discrete time quantum walks on an infinite integer line, bypassing the locality constraints that typically inhibit direct application of Molchanov formula. The validity of our representation is empirically confirmed through a benchmark analysis of the Hadamard walk, demonstrating high fidelity with traditional unitary evolution. Our results suggest that this probabilistic lens offer a powerful alternative for learning multidimensional quantum walks and provides new analytical pathways for investigating quantum systems via classical stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering in Three Coupled Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum steering is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding correlations in multi-body systems. Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to y}(-\theta),\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to x}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to x}(-\theta)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to y}(-\theta)$. Therefore, we elucidate how excitation levels and mixing angles generate and enhance steering in three coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation-coagulation processes with advection or diffusion in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a continuous fragmentation--coagulation model in which the reacting particles can be transported in physical space through either advection or diffusion. We prove new results on the generation of $C_0$-semigroups with parameter and use them to show that the Abstract Cauchy Problem associated with a more general version of the advection/diffusion--fragmentation problem generates a positive $C_0$-semigroup in spaces $L_1(\mathbb R_+, X_x, (1+m^r)dm),$ where $m$ is the particle mass, $X_x$ is either the space of integrable or continuous functions with respect to the spatial variable, and the weight exponent $r$ is sufficiently large. These results enable us to prove the classical solvability of a wide range of advection/diffusion--fragmentation--coagulation equations with unbounded coagulation kernels.</description>

      <title>Point Particles as Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work surveys a recently developed approach to the study of free point particles on Riemannian manifolds, based on the Kirillov orbit method, geometric quantization, and the geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds. We discuss that given a Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ embedded in a product of coadjoint orbits and a Hamiltonian $H$ attaining its minimum on this submanifold, such a configuration naturally induces free point particle dynamics on $\mathcal{M}$. The metric governing this dynamics is precisely defined by the quadratic expansion of $H$ around its minimum. Upon quantization, this correspondence establishes a relation between the $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a corresponding spin chain Hilbert space as well as a spectral equivalence between Laplace-Beltrami operator on $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a spin Hamiltonian. Explicit examples of this construction are presented for particles moving on the complex plane, two-dimensional sphere, flag manifolds, and the hyperbolic plane.</description>

      <title>Shifted quantum groups via critical stable envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a symmetric quiver with potential, we develop a geometric construction of shifted Yangians acting on the critical cohomologies of antidominantly framed quiver varieties with extended potentials, using the $R$-matrices constructed from critical stable envelopes. We relate such Reshetikhin type Yangians to Drinfeld type Yangians arising from critical cohomological Hall algebras. Several detailed examples, including the trivial, Jordan, and tripled Jordan quivers are explicitly computed.
  For symmetric quiver varieties with potentials, by using the smallness property of their affinization maps, we derive explicit formulas for quantum multiplication by divisors in terms of Casimir elements of the associated Lie (super)algebras, extending results from Nakajima quiver varieties to the critical setting. A similar formula in the antidominantly framed case is also obtained, which includes Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb C^3$ as examples.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions of the FLRW cosmological model via invariants of the Hamilton-Jacobi method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we proceed to solve the field equations of the spatially flat Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model in the presence of the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) by making use of the Invariants of Hamilton-Jacobi method (IHJM). This method enables us to extract systematically two independent first integrals such as \(l_{\rm HJ,1}(a,\dot{a})=c_{1}\) and \(l_{\rm HJ,2}(t,a,\dot{a})=c_{2}\) associated to the transformations group keeping the form of the Hamilton's canonical equations (HCEs) of the cosmological model invariant. Extracting these invariants means not only finding the general solution of the field equations of the model, but also obtaining the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions for the model whose dynamics acts like the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional mini-super space \(\mathbb{Q}=(a)\). In addition, to obtain the general solution of the model, the IHJM have also solved the inverse problem of calculus of variation (IPCV) without resorting to Helmholtz conditions and whether the necessary conditions for the existence of the Lagrangian function are hold or not. The main part of the IHJM is to find the generating function of the canonical transformation (CT) and then extract two independent invariants for the desired model by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). This study shows that there is a close relationship between the group of the CTs of the Hamiltonian function of the particle and the one-parameter Lie group of transformations keeping invariant the Einstein-Friedmann dynamical equation (EFDE) \(\ddot{a}=F(a,\dot{a})\), so that both of them lead to the same result. In this way, having both the IHJM and the invariants of the symmetry groups method (ISGM), a comprehensive integration theory by unifying them can be achieved for studying the desired models.</description>

      <title>Learning Stiff Dynamical Operators: Scaling, Fast-Slow Excitation, and Eigen-Consistent Neural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff dynamical systems represent a central challenge in multi scale modeling across combustion, chemical kinetics, and nonlinear dynamical systems. Neural operator learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to approximate dynamical generators from data, yet stiffness imposes severe obstacles: training errors concentrate on slow manifold states, collapse of fast dynamics occurs, and the learned operator may fail to reproduce the true eigenstructure.
  We demonstrate three key advances enabling accurate learning of stiff operators and preserving spectral fidelity: (i) stiffness aware scaling of time derivatives, (ii) fast direction excitation via local trajectory cloud bursts, and (iii) autograd-based Jacobian diagnostics ensuring eigenstructure fidelity. Applied to the Davis-Skodje system, the approach recovers both slow and fast modes across stiffness regimes, reducing fast eigenvalue error by an order of magnitude while improving rollout fidelity. These results argue that spectral fidelity - not trajectory accuracy alone - should be a first-class target in data driven learning of stiff operators.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Bargmann Invariants: Geometric Foundations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bargmann invariants, a class of gauge-invariant quantities arising from the overlaps of quantum state vectors, provide a profound and unifying framework for understanding the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of Bargmann invariants, with a particular focus on their role in shaping the informational geometry of the state space. The core of this review demonstrates how these invariants serve as a powerful tool for characterizing the intrinsic geometry of the space of quantum states, leading to applications in determining local unitary equivalence and constructing a complete set of polynomial invariants for mixed states. Furthermore, we explore their pivotal role in modern quantum information science, specifically in developing operational methods for entanglement detection without the need for full state tomography. By synthesizing historical context with recent advances, this survey aims to highlight Bargmann invariants not merely as mathematical curiosities, but as essential instruments for probing the relational and geometric features of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Random-Matrix-Induced Simplicity Bias in Over-parameterized Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-parameterization is commonly used to increase the expressivity of variational quantum circuits (VQCs), yet deeper and more highly parameterized circuits often exhibit poor trainability and limited generalization. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bianchi I spacetimes within 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Bianchi I spacetimes within the framework of the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field theory. The field equations are formulated using dimensionless variables, and the asymptotic dynamics are studied through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained. In addition, a new family of solutions follows, describing a two-dimensional splitting of the background geometry. This behavior is similar to the previously observed pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in higher-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On the homogeneity of the quantum transition probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the years 1952 and 1965, H.-C. Wang and U. Hirzebruch showed that the two-point homogeneous compact spaces with convex metrics are isometric to the spheres, the real, complex, octonion projective spaces and the Moufang plane and as well to the sets of the minimal idempotents or pure states in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. Here we reveal the physical meaning of these mathematical achievements for the quantum mechanical transition probability. We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means. This is an important difference to many other recent approaches that aim to distinguish the entire state spaces among the convex compact sets. An interesting case with non-homogeneous transition probability arises, when the $E_6$-symmetric bioctonionic projective plane is used as quantum logic.</description>

      <title>Singular basins in multiscale systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. In this Letter, we show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of universal singular funnels. We use the term singular basins to refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels. We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances. Crucially, the presence of a singular funnel may prevent the usual dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination or time-averaging of the fast variables</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Weighted Weyl Fractional Operators: Aging, Infinite Memory, and the Amnesia Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous spectral framework for the Weighted Weyl Fractional Calculus, designed to model non-local systems exhibiting aging and subjective time scales. By constructing a conjugation map involving a time-dependent weight $\omega(t)$ and a scale function $\psi(t)$, we define a new class of fractional operators that preserve the spectral tractability of time-invariant systems. We derive the Spectral Mapping Theorem for these operators and prove that Weighted Mittag-Leffler functions act as their fundamental eigenfunctions, demonstrating that the Weighted Fourier Transform naturally diagonalizes the associated evolution equations. As a physical application, we formulate a constitutive law for aging viscoelastic materials with infinite memory. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate the "Amnesia Phenomenon": we prove that rapid aging modulates the system's history, effectively transforming the hereditary power-law decay into a short-range exponential relaxation. This result provides a closed-form explanation for the loss of memory in fast-aging media, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard discretization methods.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{U}^\imath)$ be a quasi-split affine quantum symmetric pair of type $\mathsf{AIII}$. This case is of particular interest thanks to the existence of geometric realizations and Schur--Weyl dualities. We establish factorization and coproduct formulae for the Drinfeld--Cartan series $\boldsymbol\Theta_i(z)$ in the Lu--Pan--Wang--Zhang `new Drinfeld'-style presentation, generalizing the split type results from [Prz23, LP25a]. As an application, we construct a boundary analogue of the $q$-character map, and show that it is compatible with Frenkel and Reshetikhin's original $q$-character homomorphism.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect in fractal superconductors: fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau theory for Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for nonreciprocal superconducting transport in Josephson junctions formed by fractal superconductors or superconducting media with nonlocal correlations, separated by a noncentrosymmetric normal layer. We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, global symplectification and the stability of Dry Ten Martini Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any fixed irrational frequency and trigonometric-polynomial potential, we show that every type I energy with positive Lyapunov exponent that satisfies the gap-labelling condition is a boundary of an open spectral gap. As a corollary, for the almost-Mathieu operator in the supercritical regime the "all spectral gaps are open" property is robust under a small trigonometric-polynomial perturbation at any irrational frequency. The proof introduces a geometric, all-frequency approach built from three ingredients: (i) the projective action on the Lagrangian Grassmannian and an associated fibred rotation number, (ii) monotonicity of one-parameter families of (Hermitian) symplectic cocycles, and (iii) a partially hyperbolic splitting with a two-dimensional center together with a global symplectification (holonomy-driven parallel transport). This provides a partial resolution to the stability of the Dry Ten Martini Problem in the supercritical regime, and answers a question by M. Shamis regarding the survival of periodic gaps.</description>

      <title>Schwarz maps with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of symmetry of quantum mechanical systems is applied to study the structure and properties of several classes of relevant maps in quantum information theory: CPTP, PPT and Schwarz maps. First, we develop the general structure that equivariant maps $\Phi:\mathcal A \to \mathcal B$ between $C^\ast$-algebras satisfy. Then, we undertake a systematic study of unital, Hermiticity-preserving maps that are equivariant under natural unitary group actions. Schwarz maps satisfy Kadison's inequality $\Phi(X^\ast X) \geq \Phi(X)^\ast \Phi(X)$ and form an intermediate class between positive and completely positive maps. We completely classify $U(n)$-equivariant on $M_n(\mathbb C)$ and determine those that are completely positive and Schwarz. Partial classifications are then obtained for the weaker $DU(n)$-equivariance (diagonal unitary symmetry) and for tensor-product symmetries $U(n_1) \otimes U(n_2)$. In each case, the parameter regions where $\Phi$ is Schwarz or completely positive are described by explicit algebraic inequalities, and their geometry is illustrated. Finally, we further show that the $U(n)$-equivariant family satisfies $\mathrm{PPT} \iff \mathrm{EB}$, while the $DU(2)$, symmetric $DU(3)$, $U(2) \otimes U(2)$ and $U(2) \otimes U(3)$, families obey the $\mathrm{PPT}^2$ conjecture through a direct symmetry argument. These results reveal how group symmetry controls the structure of non-completely positive maps and provide new concrete examples where the $\mathrm{PPT}^2$ property holds.</description>

      <title>A bottom-up approach to fluctuating hydrodynamics: Coarse-graining of stochastic lattice gases and the Dean-Kawasaki equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a quantitative, large-scale description of many-body systems in terms of smooth variables, with microscopic details entering only through a small set of transport coefficients. Although this framework has been highly successful in characterizing macroscopic fluctuations and correlations, a systematic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics from underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics remains obscure for broad classes of interacting systems. For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond na\"ive mean-field-type gradient expansions. We further extend this approach to interacting Brownian particles by coarse-graining the Dean-Kawasaki equation, revealing a mobility proportional to the density and a diffusivity determined by the thermodynamic pressure.</description>

      <title>Another look at regularity in transport-commutator estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in how regular a transport velocity field must be in order to control Riesz-type commutators. Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2&lt; s&lt;d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the merry-go-round fictitious forces are acting like centrifugal force and Coriolis force. Like the Lorentz force Coriolis force is velocity dependent and, following Arnold, can be modeled by twisting the symplectic form. If the merry-go-round is accelerated an additional fictitious force shows up, the Euler force.
  In this article we explain how one deals symplectically with the Euler force by considering time-dependent symplectic forms. It will turn out that to treat the Euler force one also needs time-dependent primitives of the time-dependent symplectic forms.</description>

Abstract: We formulate and study a generalized virial theorem for contact Hamiltonian systems. Such systems describe mechanical systems in the presence of simple dissipative forces such as Rayleigh friction, or the vertical motion of a particle falling through a fluid (quadratic drag) under the action of constant gravity. We find a generalized virial theorem for contact Hamiltonian systems which is distinct from that obtained earlier for the symplectic case. The `contact' generalized virial theorem is shown to reduce to the earlier result on symplectic manifolds as a special case. Various examples of dissipative mechanical systems are discussed. We also formulate a generalized virial theorem in the contact Lagrangian framework.</description>

      <title>Exact linear representations of the nonlinear Cauchy problems and their smooth solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper establishes conditions under which there are exact linear representations of nonlinear partial differential equations (Cauchy problems). By introducing a certain linear operator $A$, it is shown that under these conditions there are three equivalent equations (one linear and two nonlinear), while the formal operator solution is common for all of them and is the expansion of the desired function $v(t,x)$ into a formal Taylor series.
  Using the Borel-Whitney lemma, which states that any smooth function $v(t,x)$ in a neighborhood of a point is defined by its formal Taylor series, we obtain the following statement. If all parameters of the operator $A$ are smooth functions, then there exists a smooth function $\tilde{v}(t,x)$, which for $t=0$ has the same power expansion as $v(t,x) $ and this function solves all equivalent equations.
  The Navier-Stokes and Euler equations are considered as a non-trivial examples of this approach.</description>

      <title>Alternative representation of Magnus series by exact proper operator exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this report the emphasis is on an alternative representation of the Magnus series by proper operator (matrix) exponential solutions to differential equations (systems), both linear and nonlinear ODEs and PDEs. The main idea here is in \emph{exact} \emph{linear} representations of the \emph{nonlinear} DEs. We proceeded from Dyson's time-ordered solutions, and using only generalizations of the well-known Baker-Campbell- Hausdorff (BCH) and Zassenhaus formulae for $t$-dependent operators directly converted them to simple proper operator exponents. The method being explicit both in terms of the operator and in terms of expressing the formal solution as an ordinary exponential, makes it quite easy to calculate analytical expressions to solutions in the form of a Taylor function series in one variable $t$. If introduce a mutually invertible change of variable $t$ into the original equations and then find a solution to this new equation in the form with ordinary exponential, one can obtain a completely different Taylor expansion of the desired function. The essence of this method comes down to resuming the series.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Choi isomorphism with application to open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Completely positive transformations play an important role in the description of state changes in quantum mechanics, including the time evolution of open quantum systems. One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</description>

Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describing conservative systems naturally preserves the standard notion of phase-space volume, a result known as the Liouville's theorem which is central to the formulation of classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for invariant phase-space measures for certain (generally dissipative) mechanical systems, namely, systems described by conformal vector fields on symplectic manifolds that are cotangent bundles, contact Hamiltonian systems, and systems of the Li\'enard class. The latter class of systems can be described by certain generalized conformal vector fields on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The computation of the invariant measures is achieved by making use of the formalism of Jacobi last multipliers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on a general connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by generalized Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor that contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Contact Lie systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces: from scaling symmetries to curvature-dependent reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of the notion of scaling symmetries for the case of Lie-Hamilton systems, allowing their subsequent reduction to contact Lie systems. As an illustration of the procedure, time-dependent frequency oscillators and time-dependent thermodynamic systems are analyzed from this point of view. The formalism provides a novel method for constructing contact Lie systems on the three-dimensional sphere, derived from recently established Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental four-dimensional representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$. It is shown that these systems are a particular case of a larger hierarchy of contact Lie systems on a special class of three-dimensional homogeneous spaces, namely the Cayley-Klein spaces. These include Riemannian spaces (sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes. Under certain topological conditions, some of these systems retrieve well-known two-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems through a curvature-dependent reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is proposed. The work is inspired by and generalizes the work by E.H.~Lieb [E.H. Lieb, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 24(1983), pp.243--277] on density-functional theory (DFT). We introduce a Banach space for density matrices with finite kinetic energy. The dual space is a rich class of single-particle potentials, i.e., Hermitian forms. The ground state energy of an $N$-fermion system with external forces given by any such Hermitian form is expressed as the Legendre--Fenchel transform of a convex and lower semicontinuous ``universal'' reduced density matrix functional. The formalism is employed to provide a mathematical framework for density-functional theory (DFT). The main tool here is a rigorous definition of diagonals of reduced density matrices. The result is a refinement of Lieb's results on DFT applicable to a wide variety of models.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic stability and ergodic properties of quantum trajectories under imperfect measurement, extending previous results established for the ideal case of perfect measurement. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimated trajectory, initialized from an estimated state, to the true trajectory. This result is obtained assuming that the associated quantum channel is irreducible. Building on this, we prove the uniqueness of the invariant measure and demonstrate convergence toward this measure.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviors of an electron gas in the mean-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the momentum distribution of an electron gas in a $3$-dimensional torus. The goal is to compute the occupation number of Fourier modes for some trial state obtained through random phase approximation. We obtain the mean-field analogue of momentum distribution formulas for electron gas in [Daniel and Voskov, Phys. Rev. \textbf{120}, (1960)] in high density limit and [Lam, Phys. Rev. \textbf{3}, (1971)] at metallic density. The analysis in the present paper is majorly based on the work [Christiansen, Hainzl, Nam, Comm. Math. Phys. \textbf{401}, (2023)]. Our findings are related to recent results obtained independently by Benedikter, Lill and Naidu, and the analysis applies to a general class of singular potentials rather than just the Coulomb case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.03186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $\Gamma$ a quiver without 1-cycles, we show that the Braverman--Finkelberg--Najakima quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branch algebra $\mathscr{A}_\Gamma$ of the corresponding quiver gauge theory is isomorphic to the quantized universally Laurent algebra (upper cluster $X$-algebra) associated to an explicit initial seed $\Pi_\Gamma$. We also show that $\Pi_\Gamma$ admits a cluster Donaldson--Thomas transformation as defined by Keller.</description>

      <title>On the large-time asymptotics of the defocusing mKdV equation with step-like initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation with step-like initial data approaching nonzero constants $c_l$ and $c_r$ as $x \to -\infty$ and $x\to+\infty$, respectively. Assuming $c_l&gt;c_r&gt;0$, the solution exhibits a rarefaction wave structure. We first develop the inverse scattering transform for the solution satisfying these step-like boundary conditions. Using the associated scattering data, we prove that there exists a unique global solution of the Cauchy problem and characterize it in terms of a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem. By applying the nonlinear steepest descent method to this RH problem, we rigorously obtain large-time asymptotics of rarefaction wave solution in three distinct space-time regions, each characterized by a different leading order behavior. They are: (I) a left-field region where the solution approaches the left background constant, modulo a small oscillatory correction, (II) a central region where the solution exhibits a slowly varying profile that transitions between the two constants, and (III) a right-field region where the solution tends to the right background constant, up to an algebraically small correction. Rigorous derivations of the leading terms, sub-leading terms as well as the error bounds are presented.</description>

      <title>New Instantons for Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complete, nonperturbative content of random matrix models is described by resurgent-transseries -- general solutions to their corresponding string-equations. These transseries include exponentially-suppressed multi-instanton amplitudes obtained by eigenvalue tunneling, but they also contain exponentially-enhanced and mixed instanton-like sectors with no known matrix model interpretation. This work shows how these sectors can be also described by eigenvalue tunneling in matrix models -- but on the non-physical sheet of the spectral curve describing their large-N limit. This picture further explains the full resurgence of random matrices via analysis of all possible eigenvalue integration-contours. How to calculate these "anti" eigenvalue-tunneling amplitudes is explained in detail and in various examples, such as the cubic and quartic matrix models, and their double-scaling limit to Painleve I. This further provides direct matrix-model derivations of their resurgent Stokes data, which were recently obtained by different techniques.</description>

      <title>All the D-Branes of Resurgence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown how to account for all instantons of hermitian matrix models via (anti-) eigenvalue-tunneling -- including both exponentially-suppressed and exponentially-enhanced transseries-transmonomials which are predicted by resurgence. Matrix-model eigenvalue-tunneling corresponds to ZZ-branes. The present work shows how matrix-model anti-eigenvalues correspond to negative-tension ZZ-branes; and how to compute generic nonperturbative sectors -- with both ZZ and negative-tension-ZZ branes -- in the minimal-string free-energy. Negative-tension D-branes are herein a requirement of resurgence. This results in the construction of minimal-string free-energy transseries and the analytic computation of their resurgent Stokes data. Calculations are presented via Liouville boundary conformal field theory and via (matching) matrix model analysis. Minimal-string results are extended to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Building on the matrix model analysis, one extension towards topological string theory is obtained via the remodeling-conjecture -- which allows for addressing one-cut, toric Calabi-Yau geometries. Building on the Liouville theory calculation, one other extension towards critical string theory is obtained via the H3+ - Liouville correspondence -- which allows for addressing negative-tension D-instantons in AdS spacetime. Throughout, checks of the construction and formulae are made in several examples, against both Borel resurgent analysis and string-equation transseries data.</description>

      <title>Resource-Dependent Complexity of Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11304v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantifying the complexity of quantum channels, grounded in a suitably chosen resource set. This class of convex functions is designed to analyze the complexity of both open and closed quantum systems. By leveraging Lipschitz norms inspired by quantum optimal transport theory, we rigorously establish the fundamental properties of this complexity measure. The flexibility in selecting the resource set allows us to derive effective lower bounds for gate complexities and simulation costs of both Hamiltonian simulations and dynamics of open quantum systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this complexity measure exhibits linear growth for random quantum circuits and finite-dimensional quantum simulations, up to the Brown-Susskind threshold.</description>

      <title>A scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of non-Abelian Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in dimension four, as scaling limits of lattice Yang-Mills theories or otherwise, is a central open question of mathematical physics. This paper takes the following small step towards this goal. In any dimension $d\ge 2$, we construct a scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory coupled to a Higgs field (under the degenerate potential) transforming in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. After unitary gauge fixing and taking the lattice spacing $\varepsilon\to 0$, and simultaneously taking the gauge coupling constant $g\to 0$ and the Higgs length $\alpha\to \infty$ in such a manner that $\alpha g$ is always equal to $c\varepsilon$ for some fixed $c$ and $g= O(\varepsilon^{50d})$, a stereographic projection of the gauge field is shown to converge to a scale-invariant massive Gaussian field. This gives the first construction of a scaling limit of a non-Abelian lattice Yang-Mills theory in a dimension higher than two, as well as the first rigorous proof of mass generation by the Higgs mechanism in such a theory. Analogous results are proved for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ theory as well. The question of constructing a non-Gaussian scaling limit remains open.</description>

Abstract: We show that many tame modules of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra can be explicitly constructed in a purely combinatorial way using the theory of $q$-characters. The examples include families of evaluation modules obtained from analytic continuation and automorphism twists of Verma modules of the quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra. The combinatorial bases in the modules are labeled by colored plane partitions with various properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system operates as a quantum heat engine across the range of parameters considered. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Local spectral approximation of unbounded operators: non-asymptotic and unified error quantification for subspace methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for subspace methods which approximate the spectra of self-adjoint, unbounded operators in a local region. Using the projection-valued measure, we derive integrated spectral inequalities that also apply to unbounded operators. Our framework is non-asymptotic, gap-independent, and enables a unified error quantification of numerical routines subject to multiple error sources. Furthermore, we formalize the class of methods applicable to our framework, and establish a rigorous foundation for dimension detection in the presence of noise as solution to frequent numerical artifacts such as spectral pollution. The practical relevance of this non-asymptotic analysis is substantiated by its recent application to sampled prolate filter diagonalization, where it successfully predicted a sharp accuracy transition linking spectral density to the minimal observation time required to decompose a signal.</description>

      <title>Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parametrised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>Surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries in Shallow Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that two subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the first subsystem symmetry, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond the first subsystem symmetry, we also identify a second one, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</description>

Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions of finite directed polymers near a corrugated wall via two-replica analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional lattice model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is modeled as an $N$-step directed one-dimensional random walk on the half-line $x \ge 0$. Its interaction with the wall is described by a quenched, site-dependent, short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j = 1,\ldots,N$), distributed according to $Q(u_j)$ and localized at $x = 0$. By computing the first two disorder--averaged moments of the partition function, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, and by analyzing the analytic structure of the resulting expressions, we derive an explicit criterion for the coincidence or distinction of the pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, although the transition points of the annealed and quenched systems are always different in the thermodynamic limit, for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this difference is hardly detectable. Our results may help reconcile conflicting views on whether quenched disorder is marginally relevant.</description>

      <title>Volume-Distance-Ratio Asymptote and Spacetime Inextendibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops geometric criteria for determining the inextendibility of spacetimes near singularities based on asymptotic analysis of volume-distance relationships. We introduce and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the volume-distance-ratio (VDR), defined as the ratio of volumes of small chronological diamonds to appropriate powers of distances between their vertices. In $C^0$ and $C^{0,1}$ spacetimes (which are weaker than the classical $C^2$ regularity), we prove that VDR converges to the Minkowski value as chronological diamonds approach accumulation points.
  The central contribution is the establishment of inextendibility criteria showing that failure of VDR convergence to the Minkowski value implies inextendibility of the spacetime. These criteria apply to spacetime extensions satisfying $C^0$ locally-null-non-accumulating strongly-causal conditions and $C^{0,1}$ strongly-causal conditions, where the locally-null-non-accumulation condition is introduced as a fundamental structural property ensuring the validity of VDR-based inextendibility criteria.
  Concrete applications demonstrate the power and scope of these methods. We prove that $2$-dimensional Misner spacetime is $C^0$ strongly-causal inextendible and that spatially flat FLRW spacetimes with linear scale factor behavior are $C^0$ locally-null-non-accumulating strongly-causal inextendible. Furthermore, we establish $C^{0,1}$ strongly-causal inextendibility for Christodoulou's class of spherically symmetric self-similar naked singularity spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for Matrix-Product Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this Letter, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems dominated by strong nonlinearity are reformulated within a dynamical framework based on the Nambu bracket formalism. It is demonstrated that general complex nonlinear non-equilibrium systems can be locally reduced to a simple form of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET). Furthermore, mathematical and dynamical obstacles encountered in extending this reduction globally are discussed, and a generalized formulation that incorporates nonlinear effects through mixed higher-order tensors is proposed.</description>

      <title>Equivalence relations between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements play a fundamental role in quantum information. Therefore, increasing efforts are being made to construct symmetric measurement operators for qudit systems. A wide class of projective measurements corresponds to complex projective 2-designs, which include symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) POVMs and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). In this paper, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames, both of which are common generalizations of SIC POVMs and MUBs to operators of arbitrary rank. It turns out that there exist rich families of operators that belong to only one of those two classes. This raises important questions about which symmetries have to be preserved for applicational prominence.</description>

      <title>On the Martin boundary for discrete TASEP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of fourth-order quasilinear degenerate parabolic equations under both time-and space-dependent and time-and space-independent forces, modeling non-Newtonian thin-film flow over a solid surface in the "complete wetting" regime. By analyzing the quantitative properties of solutions to non-autonomous differential inequalities and employing refined integral estimates, we derive two-sided convergence rate estimates for the solution. Numerical simulations are further provided to illustrate the consistency of our main results with the observed physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Russo-Townsend formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out two examples in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and two particular potentials $W(\psi)$ are chosen such that integrating out $\psi$ gives: (i) the ModMaxBorn theory; and (ii) the ModMax theory. We also briefly discuss supersymmetric generalisations of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid coupling with operator inference and the overlapping Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Freidel-Maillet type equations on fused K-matrices over the positive part of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The positive part $U_q^+$ of the quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ has a reflection equation presentation of Freidel-Maillet type, due to Baseilhac 2021. This presentation involves a K-matrix of dimension $2 \times 2$. Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Field Wave Dynamics and Quasinormal Modes of the Teo Rotating Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalar field perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole. We also compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum using first order WKB approximation. After separation of variables, we obtain a Schroedinger type radial equation and a smooth barrier potential which is shaped by the localized frame-dragging effects of the wormhole throat. This barrier potential provides damped oscillatory modes for the range of spins that were examined. The QNM spectrum shows a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillating frequency of the scalar wave and its damping rate decrease, which indicates progressively longer lived modes in the absence of absorption due to a horizon. We have verified the correspondence in the Eikonal limit, by obtaining the radius of the photon ring, its orbital frequency, and the Lyaponov exponent. Next, we compared the Teo wormhole QNM with that of the Kerr black hole QNM to find that the Kerr QNM is dictated by absorption at the horizon and they also exhibit symmetric pro-grade retrograde mode splitting, whereas the Teo wormhole QNM shows a stronger, and spatially confined response to spin. The Teo wormhole also exhibit partial reflection at the throat and a very distinct one-sided mode splitting which rapidly saturates as the spin increases. Additionally, the rotating Teo wormhole allows an ergoregion with the possibility of frequency kinematics compatible with superradiance. Due to the absence of an event horizon or a dissipative boundary, there is no evidence of classical superradiant amplification that was seen in Kerr. The results we obtained clearly demonstrates how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects. They also provide certain characteristic spectral signatures that can be used to distinguish rotating wormhole spacetimes from rotating black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>
