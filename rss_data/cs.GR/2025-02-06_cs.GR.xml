      <title>INST-Sculpt: Interactive Stroke-based Neural SDF Sculpting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in implicit neural representations have made them a popular choice for modeling 3D geometry, achieving impressive results in tasks such as shape representation, reconstruction, and learning priors. However, directly editing these representations poses challenges due to the complex relationship between model weights and surface regions they influence. Among such editing tools, sculpting, which allows users to interactively carve or extrude the surface, is a valuable editing operation to the graphics and modeling community. While traditional mesh-based tools like ZBrush facilitate fast and intuitive edits, a comparable toolkit for sculpting neural SDFs is currently lacking. We introduce a framework that enables interactive surface sculpting edits directly on neural implicit representations. Unlike previous works limited to spot edits, our approach allows users to perform stroke-based modifications on the fly, ensuring intuitive shape manipulation without switching representations. By employing tubular neighborhoods to sample strokes and custom brush profiles, we achieve smooth deformations along user-defined curves, providing precise control over the sculpting process. Our method demonstrates that intricate and versatile edits can be made while preserving the smooth nature of implicit representations.</description>

      <title>MIND: Microstructure INverse Design with Generative Hybrid Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse design of microstructures plays a pivotal role in optimizing metamaterials with specific, targeted physical properties. While traditional forward design methods are constrained by their inability to explore the vast combinatorial design space, inverse design offers a compelling alternative by directly generating structures that fulfill predefined performance criteria. However, achieving precise control over both geometry and material properties remains a significant challenge due to their intricate interdependence. Existing approaches, which typically rely on voxel or parametric representations, often limit design flexibility and structural diversity. In this work, we present a novel generative model that integrates latent diffusion with Holoplane, an advanced hybrid neural representation that simultaneously encodes both geometric and physical properties. This combination ensures superior alignment between geometry and properties. Our approach generalizes across multiple microstructure classes, enabling the generation of diverse, tileable microstructures with significantly improved property accuracy and enhanced control over geometric validity, surpassing the performance of existing methods. We introduce a multi-class dataset encompassing a variety of geometric morphologies, including truss, shell, tube, and plate structures, to train and validate our model. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to generate microstructures that meet target properties, maintain geometric validity, and integrate seamlessly into complex assemblies. Additionally, we explore the potential of our framework through the generation of new microstructures, cross-class interpolation, and the infilling of heterogeneous microstructures. The dataset and source code will be open-sourced upon publication.</description>

      <title>MotionAgent: Fine-grained Controllable Video Generation via Motion Field Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MotionAgent, enabling fine-grained motion control for text-guided image-to-video generation. The key technique is the motion field agent that converts motion information in text prompts into explicit motion fields, providing flexible and precise motion guidance. Specifically, the agent extracts the object movement and camera motion described in the text and converts them into object trajectories and camera extrinsics, respectively. An analytical optical flow composition module integrates these motion representations in 3D space and projects them into a unified optical flow. An optical flow adapter takes the flow to control the base image-to-video diffusion model for generating fine-grained controlled videos. The significant improvement in the Video-Text Camera Motion metrics on VBench indicates that our method achieves precise control over camera motion. We construct a subset of VBench to evaluate the alignment of motion information in the text and the generated video, outperforming other advanced models on motion generation accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the early stages of interface design, designers need to produce multiple sketches to explore a design space. Design tools often fail to support this critical stage, because they insist on specifying more details than necessary. Although recent advances in generative AI have raised hopes of solving this issue, in practice they fail because expressing loose ideas in a prompt is impractical. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based approach to the low-effort generation of interface sketches. It breaks new ground by allowing flexible control of the generation process via three types of inputs: A) prompts, B) wireframes, and C) visual flows. The designer can provide any combination of these as input at any level of detail, and will get a diverse gallery of low-fidelity solutions in response. The unique benefit is that large design spaces can be explored rapidly with very little effort in input-specification. We present qualitative results for various combinations of input specifications. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model aligns more accurately with these specifications than other models.</description>

      <title>Seeing World Dynamics in a Nutshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently representing casually captured monocular videos in a spatially- and temporally-coherent manner. While existing approaches predominantly rely on 2D/2.5D techniques treating videos as collections of spatiotemporal pixels, they struggle with complex motions, occlusions, and geometric consistency due to absence of temporal coherence and explicit 3D structure. Drawing inspiration from monocular video as a projection of the dynamic 3D world, we explore representing videos in their intrinsic 3D form through continuous flows of Gaussian primitives in space-time. In this paper, we propose NutWorld, a novel framework that efficiently transforms monocular videos into dynamic 3D Gaussian representations in a single forward pass. At its core, NutWorld introduces a structured spatial-temporal aligned Gaussian (STAG) representation, enabling optimization-free scene modeling with effective depth and flow regularization. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NutWorld achieves high-fidelity video reconstruction quality while enabling various downstream applications in real-time. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/Nut-World/NutWorld.</description>

      <title>RayGauss: Volumetric Gaussian-Based Ray Casting for Photorealistic Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable volumetric rendering-based methods made significant progress in novel view synthesis. On one hand, innovative methods have replaced the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) network with locally parameterized structures, enabling high-quality renderings in a reasonable time. On the other hand, approaches have used differentiable splatting instead of NeRF's ray casting to optimize radiance fields rapidly using Gaussian kernels, allowing for fine adaptation to the scene. However, differentiable ray casting of irregularly spaced kernels has been scarcely explored, while splatting, despite enabling fast rendering times, is susceptible to clearly visible artifacts.
  Our work closes this gap by providing a physically consistent formulation of the emitted radiance c and density {\sigma}, decomposed with Gaussian functions associated with Spherical Gaussians/Harmonics for all-frequency colorimetric representation. We also introduce a method enabling differentiable ray casting of irregularly distributed Gaussians using an algorithm that integrates radiance fields slab by slab and leverages a BVH structure. This allows our approach to finely adapt to the scene while avoiding splatting artifacts. As a result, we achieve superior rendering quality compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining reasonable training times and achieving inference speeds of 25 FPS on the Blender dataset.

      <title>Assessing Open-world Forgetting in Generative Image Model Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced image generation capabilities. However, customizing these models with new classes often leads to unintended consequences that compromise their reliability. We introduce the concept of open-world forgetting to characterize the vast scope of these unintended alterations. Our work presents the first systematic investigation into open-world forgetting in diffusion models, focusing on semantic and appearance drift of representations. Using zero-shot classification, we demonstrate that even minor model adaptations can lead to significant semantic drift affecting areas far beyond newly introduced concepts, with accuracy drops of up to 60% on previously learned concepts. Our analysis of appearance drift reveals substantial changes in texture and color distributions of generated content. To address these issues, we propose a functional regularization strategy that effectively preserves original capabilities while accommodating new concepts. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both semantic and appearance drift. Our study highlights the importance of considering open-world forgetting in future research on model customization and finetuning methods.</description>

      <title>GS-LiDAR: Generating Realistic LiDAR Point Clouds with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS) has emerged as a novel task within LiDAR simulation, offering valuable simulated point cloud data from novel viewpoints to aid in autonomous driving systems. However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency.</description>
