      <title>An Obliquity Measurement of the Hot Neptune TOI-1694b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectral observations of the multiplanet host TOI-1694 during the transit of TOI-1694b, a 26.1 $M_\oplus$ hot Neptune with a 3.77-day orbit. By analyzing radial velocities obtained from the Keck Planet Finder, we modeled the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and constrained the sky-projected obliquity to ${9\degree}^{+22\degree}_{-18\degree}$, which is strong evidence for a nearly aligned orbit. TOI-1694b is one of fewer than ten small planets accompanied by confirmed outer giant planets for which the obliquity has been measured. We consider the significance of the outer planet TOI-1694c, a Jupiter-mass planet with a 1-year orbit, and its potential role in influencing the orbit of TOI-1694b to its current state. Incorporating our measurement, we discuss the bifurcation in hot Neptune obliquities and present evidence for an independent polar population. The observed polar planets nearly ubiquitously have periods of $\le 6$ days and mass ratios of $10^{-4}$. Early perturbations by outer companions from resonance crossings in the disk-dispersal stage provide the most compelling explanation for this population. Systems which lack the necessary configuration will retain their primordial obliquity, since hot Neptunes lack the angular momentum needed to realign their hosts on relevant timescales.</description>

      <title>Detailed Calculations of the Efficiency of Planetesimal Accretion in the Core-Accretion Model -III: The Contribution of Planetesimals Beyond Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing our initiative on advancing the calculations of planetesimal accretion in the core-accretion model, we present here the results of our recent study of the contributions of planetesimals around and beyond the orbit of Saturn. In our first two papers [ApJ, 899:45; 941:117], where our focus was on the effects of the Sun and Saturn, the initial distribution of planetesimals was limited to the regions around the accretion zone of a growing Jupiter. In this paper, we expanded that distribution to regions beyond the accretion zone of Saturn. We integrated the orbits of a large ensemble of planetesimals and studied the rate of their capture by the growing proto-Jupiter. In order to be consistent with our previous studies, we did not consider the effect of the nebular gas. Results demonstrated that the exterior planetesimals, especially those beyond 8 AU, have only slight contributions to the growth and metallicity of the growing Jupiter. The final mass and composition of this planet is mainly due to the planetesimals inside and around its accretion zone. Our study shows that although the rate of capture varies slightly by the size and composition of planetesimals, in general, the final results are independent of the size and material of these bodies. Results also pointed to a new finding: the rate of accretion follows the same trend as that of the evolution of Jupiter's envelope, with the largest accretion occurring during the envelope's collapse. We present details of our analysis and discuss the implications of their results.</description>

      <title>Results of numerical integrations of the orbits of fictive asteroids in vicinity of 2:1, 3:1 and 3:2 resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present our results of numerical integrations of orbits of fictive massless particle in vicinity of resonance. Our goal is to study the dependences of period (frequency) of resonance perturbations and the width of the resonance on mass and orbital eccentricity of perturbing planet and on the initial difference of longitude between test particle and perturbing planet. The main attention is paid to planar restricted three body problem, but some computations are done for a spatial case.</description>

      <title>Demographics of M Dwarf Binary Exoplanet Hosts Discovered by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs have become increasingly important in the detection of exoplanets and the study of Earth-sized planets and their habitability. However, 20-30% of M dwarfs have companions that can impact the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We use high-resolution imaging and Gaia astrometry to detect stellar companions around M dwarf exoplanet hosts discovered by TESS and determine the projected separation and estimated stellar masses for each system. We find 47 companions around 216 M dwarfs and a multiplicity rate of $19.4\pm2.7$% that is consistent with field M dwarfs. The binary projected separation distribution is shifted to larger separations, confirming the lack of close binaries hosting transiting exoplanets seen in previous studies. We correct the radii of planets with nearby companions and examine the properties of planets in M dwarf multi-star systems. We also note three multi-planet systems that occur in close binaries ($\lesssim 50$ au) where planet formation is expected to be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Potential Interior Structures and Habitability of Super-Earth Exoplanets LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b and TOI-1468 c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze four super-Earth exoplanets, LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b, and TOI-1468 c, which orbit M-dwarf stars in the habitable zone. Their relative proximity, within 40 parsecs, makes them prime candidates for follow-up observations and atmospheric and habitability studies. This paper aims to assess their internal structure and habitability, considering their tidal heating, atmospheric heating, and global transport. We model the interior structure of the planets by applying Bayesian inference to an exoplanet's interior model. A constant quality factor model is used to calculate the range of tidal heating, and a one-dimensional analytical model of tidally locked planets is used to assess their surface temperature distribution and habitability. Assuming no or only thin atmospheres, K2-18 b and TOI-1468 c are likely to be water worlds. However, TOI-1452 b and LHS 1140 b may have rocky surfaces. We find that tidal heating is not enough to raise the global mean surface temperature, but greenhouse heating can effectively do so. If the considered planets have retained thick atmospheres, K2-18 b, TOI-1468 c, and TOI-1452 b may, for significant atmospheric heating and heat transport factors, be too hot to sustain liquid water on their surface. However, the lower instellation of LHS 1140 b and the non-zero probability of it having a rocky surface give more space for habitable conditions on the planet.</description>

      <title>Characterization of seven transiting systems including four warm Jupiters from SOPHIE and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study of seven systems, three of which TOI-2295, TOI-2537, and TOI-5110 are newly discovered planetary systems. Through the analysis of TESS photometry, SOPHIE radial velocities, and high-spatial resolution imaging, we found that TOI-2295b, TOI-2537b, and TOI-5110b are transiting warm Jupiters with orbital periods ranging from 30 to 94 d, masses between 0.9 and 2.9 MJ, and radii ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 RJ. Both TOI-2295 and TOI-2537 each harbor at least one additional, outer planet. Their outer planets TOI-2295c and TOI-2537c are characterized by orbital periods of 966.5 +/- 4.3 and 1920^{+230}_{-140} d, respectively, and minimum masses of 5.61^{+0.23}_{-0.24} and 7.2 +/- 0.5 MJ, respectively. We also investigated and characterized the two recently reported warm Jupiters TOI-1836b and TOI-5076b, which we independently detected in SOPHIE RVs. Additionally, we study the planetary candidates TOI-4081.01 and TOI-4168.01. For TOI-4081.01, despite our detection in radial velocities, we cannot rule out perturbation by a blended eclipsing binary and thus exercise caution regarding its planetary nature. On the other hand, we identify TOI-4168.01 as a firm false positive. Finally, we highlight interesting characteristics of these new planetary systems. The transits of TOI-2295b are highly grazing, with an impact parameter of 1.056$^{+0.063}_{-0.043}$. TOI-2537b, in turn, is a temperate Jupiter with an effective temperature of 307+/-15 K and can serve as a valuable low-irradiation control for models of hot Jupiter inflation anomalies. We also detected significant transit timing variations (TTVs) for TOI-2537b, which are likely caused by gravitational interactions with the outer planet TOI-2537c. Finally, TOI-5110b stands out due to its orbital eccentricity of 0.75+/- 0.03, one of the highest planetary eccentricities discovered thus far.</description>

      <title>CHEOPS observations confirm nodal precession in the WASP-33 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We aim to observe the transits and occultations of WASP-33b, which orbits a rapidly-rotating $\delta$ Scuti pulsator, with the goal of measuring the orbital obliquity via the gravity-darkening effect, and constraining the geometric albedo via the occultation depth. Methods: We observed four transits and four occultations with CHEOPS, and employ a variety of techniques to remove the effects of the stellar pulsations from the light curves, as well as the usual CHEOPS systematic effects. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of low-resolution spectral and Gaia data to re-determine the stellar properties of WASP-33. Results: We measure an orbital obliquity 111.3 +0.2 -0.7 degrees, which is consistent with previous measurements made via Doppler tomography. We also measure the planetary impact parameter, and confirm that this parameter is undergoing rapid secular evolution as a result of nodal precession of the planetary orbit. This precession allows us to determine the second-order fluid Love number of the star, which we find agrees well with the predictions of theoretical stellar models. We are unable to robustly measure a unique value of the occultation depth, and emphasise the need for long-baseline observations to better measure the pulsation periods.</description>

      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>

      <title>Probing the gas that builds planets: Results from the JWST MINDS program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared observations with JWST open up a new window into the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disk (&lt;few au) where planets are built. Results from the MIRI GTO program MINDS (PI: Th. Henning, co-PI: I. Kamp) are presented for several disks around T Tauri and lower-mass stars. A large diversity in spectra is found. Some disks are very rich in H2O lines whereas other disks show prominent CO2. The spectra of disks around very low-mass stars (&lt;0.3 MSun, late-M type stars like Trappist-1) are dominated by C2H2 and other hydrocarbon features including those of benzene, suggesting volatile C/O&gt;1. Together these data point to a rich chemistry in the inner regions that is linked to the physical structure of these disks (e.g., dust traps) and that may be affected by processes such as radial drift of icy pebbles from the outer to the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Can Alfv\'enic Fluctuations Affect the Correlation and Complexity of Magnetic Fields in Magnetic Ejecta? A Case Study Based on Multi-Spacecraft Measurements at 1~au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether Alfv\'enic fluctuations (AFs) can affect the structure of magnetic ejecta (MEs) within interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We study an ICME observed on 2001 December 29 at 1 au by ACE and Wind, at a total angular separation of $\sim$0.8$^\circ$ ($\sim0.014$~au). We focus on the correlation and complexity of its magnetic structure measured between two spacecraft in association with large-amplitude AFs. The Alfv\'enicity of the ME is investigated in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations. We find that as for the event of interest, large-amplitude AFs occur in the rear region of the ME at both Wind and ACE with a duration of about six hours. We compare the correlation of the magnetic field strength and vector components measured between Wind and ACE, and investigate complexity in terms of the magnetic hodograms. The region showing AFs is found to be associated with a decreased correlation of the magnetic field components and an increased complexity of the ME magnetic configuration detected at ACE and Wind, which may be due to the fact that the two spacecraft crossing the same ME along different trajectories likely sampled AFs in different oscillation phases. Combining multi-point in-situ measurements and remote-sensing observations of the ICME source region, we further discuss different potential sources of the AFs.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Morning-to-Evening Limb Asymmetry on the Cool Low-Density Exoplanet WASP-107b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atmospheric properties of hot exoplanets are expected to be different between the morning and the evening limb due to global atmospheric circulation. Ground-based observations at high spectral resolution have detected this limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot (&gt;2000 K) exoplanets, but the prevalence of the phenomenon in the broader exoplanetary population remains unexplored. Here we use JWST/NIRCam transmission spectra between 2.5 and 4.0 $\mu$m to find evidence of limb asymmetry on exoplanet WASP-107 b. With its equilibrium temperature of 770 K and low density of 0.126 gm c$^{-3}$, WASP-107 b probes a very different regime compared to ultra-hot giant planets and was not expected to exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity according to atmospheric models. We infer instead a morning-evening temperature difference on the order of 100 K with a hotter evening limb. Further observations on other cooler exoplanets are needed to determine whether WASP-107 b is an outlier or the models underestimate the presence of limb asymmetry in exoplanets.</description>

Abstract: Terrestrial planets in the Habitable Zone of Sun-like stars are priority targets for detection and observation by the next generation of space telescopes. Earth's long-term habitability may have been tied to the geological carbon cycle, a process critically facilitated by plate tectonics. In the modern Earth, plate motion corresponds to a mantle convection regime called mobile-lid. The alternate, stagnant-lid regime is found on Mars and Venus, which may have lacked strong enough weathering feedbacks to sustain surface liquid water over geological timescales if initially present. Constraining observational strategies able to infer the most common regime in terrestrial exoplanets requires quantitative predictions of the atmospheric composition of planets in either regime. We use endmember models of volcanic outgassing and crust weathering for the stagnant- and mobile-lid convection regimes, that we couple to models of atmospheric chemistry and climate, and ocean chemistry to simulate the atmospheric evolution of these worlds in the Habitable Zone. In our simulations under the two alternate regimes, we find that the fraction of planets possessing climates consistent with surface liquid water is virtually the same. Despite this unexpected similarity, we predict that a mission capable of detecting atmospheric CO2 abundance above 0.1 bar in 25 terrestrial exoplanets is extremely likely (&gt;95% of samples) to infer the dominant interior convection regime in that sample with strong evidence (10:1 odds). This offers guidance for the specifications of the Habitable Worlds Observatory NASA concept mission and other future missions capable of probing samples of habitable exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Pebble Accretion</title>

Abstract: Pebble accretion refers to the growth of planetary bodies through the accretion of pebble-sized particles. Pebbles are defined in terms of their aerodynamically size $\tau_s$, which describes the level of coupling to the disk gas. Observations confirms the presence of pebble-sized particles in both protoplanetary disks and the early solar system. Pebble accretion proceeds through the settling mechanism, where particles settle to the surface of the planet. This Chapter discusses the key aspects of the pebble accretion framework: the accretion regimes, the planet initiation mass, and the planet isolation masses. The accretion behavior of loosely coupled $\tau_s &gt; 1$ particles, referred to as "large pebbles", is also examined. The pebble accretion probability, $\epsilon$, is shown to be a useful parameter for evaluating the efficiency of the process, though this quantity is not necessarily high. Distinctions between pebble and planetesimal accretion are outlined. Pebble accretion, in particular, can be a highly effective mechanism in dense rings, as witnessed with ALMA.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Dependence of Giant Planets around M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar metallicity ([Fe/H] and [M/H]) dependence of giant planets around M dwarfs by comparing the metallicity distribution of 746 field M dwarfs without known giant planets with a sample of 22 M dwarfs hosting confirmed giant planets. All metallicity measurements are homogeneously obtained through the same methodology based on the near-infrared spectra collected with a single instrument SpeX mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We find that 1) giant planets favor metal-rich M dwarfs at a 4-5$\sigma$ confidence level, depending on the band of spectra used to derive metallicity; 2) hot ($a/R_\ast\leq 20$) and warm ($a/R_\ast&gt; 20$) Jupiters do not show a significant difference in the metallicity distribution. Our results suggest that giant planets around M and FGK stars, which are already known to prefer metal-rich hosts, probably have a similar formation channel. In particular, hot and warm Jupiters around M dwarfs may have the same origin as they have indistinguishable metallicity distributions. With the refined stellar and planetary parameters, we examine the stellar metallicities and the masses of giant planets where we find no significant correlation. M dwarfs with multiple giant planets or with a single giant planet have similar stellar metallicities. Mid-to-late type M stars hosting gas giants do not show an apparent preference to higher metallicities compared with those early-M dwarfs with gas giants and field M dwarfs.</description>
