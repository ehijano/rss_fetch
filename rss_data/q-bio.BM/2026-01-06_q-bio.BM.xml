      <title>Fold-switching proteins push the boundaries of conformational ensemble prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A protein's function depends critically on its conformational ensemble, a collection of energy weighted structures whose balance depends on temperature and environment. Though recent deep learning (DL) methods have substantially advanced predictions of single protein structures, computationally modeling conformational ensembles remains a challenge. Here, we focus on modeling fold-switching proteins, which remodel their secondary and/or tertiary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli. These underrepresented members of the protein universe serve as test cases for a method's generalizability. They reveal that DL models often predict conformational ensembles by association with training-set structures, limiting generalizability. These observations suggest use cases for when DL methods will likely succeed or fail. Developing computational methods that successfully identify new fold-switching proteins from large pools of candidates may advance modeling conformational ensembles more broadly.</description>

      <title>Predicting Early and Complete Drug Release from Long-Acting Injectables Using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer-based long-acting injectables (LAIs) have transformed the treatment of chronic diseases by enabling controlled drug delivery, thus reducing dosing frequency and extending therapeutic duration. Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (&gt;0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Selective Imperfection as a Generative Framework for Analysis, Creativity and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.</description>

      <title>ETDock: A Novel Equivariant Transformer for Protein-Ligand Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the docking between proteins and ligands is a crucial and challenging task for drug discovery. However, traditional docking methods mainly rely on scoring functions, and deep learning-based docking approaches usually neglect the 3D spatial information of proteins and ligands, as well as the graph-level features of ligands, which limits their performance. To address these limitations, we propose an equivariant transformer neural network for protein-ligand docking pose prediction. Our approach involves the fusion of ligand graph-level features by feature processing, followed by the learning of ligand and protein representations using our proposed TAMformer module. Additionally, we employ an iterative optimization approach based on the predicted distance matrix to generate refined ligand poses. The experimental results on real datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Heteroskedasticity and Resolving Multicollinearity Paradoxes in Physicochemical Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24643</link>

Abstract: Lipophilicity (logP) prediction remains central to drug discovery, yet linear regression models for this task frequently violate statistical assumptions in ways that invalidate their reported performance metrics. We analyzed 426,850 bioactive molecules from a rigorously curated intersection of PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules databases, revealing severe heteroskedasticity in linear models predicting computed logP values (XLOGP3): residual variance increases 4.2-fold in lipophilic regions (logP greater than 5) compared to balanced regions (logP 2 to 4). Classical remediation strategies (Weighted Least Squares and Box-Cox transformation) failed to resolve this violation (Breusch-Pagan p-value less than 0.0001 for all variants). Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forest R-squared of 0.764, XGBoost R-squared of 0.765) proved inherently robust to heteroskedasticity while delivering superior predictive performance. SHAP analysis resolved a critical multicollinearity paradox: despite a weak bivariate correlation of 0.146, molecular weight emerged as the single most important predictor (mean absolute SHAP value of 0.573), with its effect suppressed in simple correlations by confounding with topological polar surface area (TPSA). These findings demonstrate that standard linear models face fundamental challenges for computed lipophilicity prediction and provide a principled framework for interpreting ensemble models in QSAR applications.</description>
