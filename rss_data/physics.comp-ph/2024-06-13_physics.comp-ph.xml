      <title>FireBench: A High-fidelity Ensemble Simulation Framework for Exploring Wildfire Behavior and Data-driven Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Wildfire research uses ensemble methods to analyze fire behaviors and assess uncertainties. Nonetheless, current research methods are either confined to simple models or complex simulations with limits. Modern computing tools could allow for efficient, high-fidelity ensemble simulations. Aims. This study proposes a high-fidelity ensemble wildfire simulation framework for studying wildfire behavior, ML tasks, fire-risk assessment, and uncertainty analysis. Methods. In this research, we present a simulation framework that integrates the Swirl-Fire large-eddy simulation tool for wildfire predictions with the Vizier optimization platform for automated run-time management of ensemble simulations and large-scale batch processing. All simulations are executed on tensor-processing units to enhance computational efficiency. Key results. A dataset of 117 simulations is created, each with 1.35 billion mesh points. The simulations are compared to existing experimental data and show good agreement in terms of fire rate of spread. Computations are done for fire acceleration, mean rate of spread, and fireline intensity. Conclusions. Strong coupling between these 2 parameters are observed for the fire spread and intermittency. A critical Froude number that delineates fires from plume-driven to convection-driven is identified and confirmed with literature observations. Implications. The ensemble simulation framework is efficient in facilitating parametric wildfire studies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of knowledge of wall-bounded turbulence via symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of high performance computer and experimental technology, the study of turbulence has accumulated a large number of high fidelity data. However, few general turbulence knowledge has been found from the data. So we use the symbolic regression(SR) method to find a new mixing length formula which is generally valid in wall-bounded turbulence, and this formula has physical interpretation that it has correct asymptotic relationships in viscous sublayer,buffer layer ,log-law region and outer region . Coupled with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS) solver, we test several classic cases. The prediction results fully demonstrate the accuracy and generalization of the formula. So far, we have found that SR method can help us find general laws from complex turbulent systems, and it is expected that through this 'white box' machine learning method, more turbulence knowledge with physical interpretation can be found in the future.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of General Noise Model Parameters from Surface Code's Syndrome Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active research on the surface code shows that its decoding performance can be significantly enhanced by utilizing the information of the noise model and optimizing the grid shape and decoding algorithm. Usually, the parameters in the noise model for the quantum error correction code must be prepared separately using some method, such as the quantum process tomography. There is a strong need to perform noise model estimation in parallel with the syndrome measurement during decoding to avoid the demanding prior tomography procedure. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-explored for Pauli noise, it remains under-studied for more complex noise models like amplitude damping. In this paper, we propose general noise model Bayesian inference methods that integrate the surface code's tensor network simulator, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, where the noise parameters are constant and do not change, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic situation, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present the numerical results of applying the proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and non-uniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-modulated topological phase transition in AlSb/InSe heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for controllable topological phase by means of external stimuli in two-dimensional (2D) material-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is currently an active field for both the underlying physics and practical applications. Here, using first-principles calculations, we investigate electric-field-modulated topological phase transition in a vdW heterobilayer formed by vertically stacking 2D AlSb and InSe monolayers. The AlSb/InSe heterobilayer studied possesses both dynamical and thermal stabilities, which is a direct bandgap semiconductor and forms a Z-scheme heterojunction. With inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and applying external electric field, the bandgap decreases at first and then increase, and a trivial insulator to topological insulator phase transition is observed. For the topological insulator phase, band inversion is ascribed to the strong SOC of p orbitals of Sb. Our work paves the way for the design and application of multifunctional nanoscale devices such as topological field effect transistor.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of two-dimensional interacting lattice electrons using symmetry-aware neural backflow transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent ground state of quantum many-body systems, including for fermionic systems. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in Neural Slater-Backflow-Jastrow wavefunction ansatzes, and demonstrate how our model allows us to target the ground state and low-lying excited states. To capture the Hamiltonian symmetries, we introduce group-equivariant backflow transformations. We study the low-energy excitation spectrum of the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling, and find that our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves the ground-state energies, and yields accurate low-lying excited states for up to 10x10 lattices. We additionally compute the two-point density-correlation function and the structure factor to detect the phase transition and determine the critical point. Finally, we quantify the variational accuracy of our model using the V-score.</description>

      <title>Numerical relativity simulations of compact binaries: comparison of cell- and vertex-centered adaptive meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the compact binary evolution problem of numerical relativity, in the finite-difference, block-based, adaptive mesh refinement context, choices must be made on how evolved fields are to be discretized. In GR-Athena++, the space-time solver was previously fixed to be vertex-centered. Here, our recent extensions to a cell-centered treatment, are described. Simplifications in the handling of variables during the treatment of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) evolution are found. A novelty is that performance comparison for the two choices of grid sampling is made within a single code-base. In the case of a binary black hole inspiral-merger problem, by evolving geometric fields on vertex-centers, an average $\sim 20\%$ speed increase is observed, when compared against cell-centered sampling. The opposite occurs in the GRMHD setting. A binary neutron star inspiral-merger-collapse problem, representative of typical production simulations is considered. We find that cell-centered sampling for the space-time solver improves performance, by a similar factor.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Machine Learning Model Comparison for Cherenkov and Scintillation Light Separation due to Particle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for novel detector mediums such as Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) has increased over the last few decades due to their capability for both low energy particle interactions and higher light yield. Recently, the usage of machine learning (ML) methods in high-energy physics has also been increasing. The ML and AI methods are used in many physics projects in the field since they provide effective and sensitive results. In this study, we aimed to develop a comprehensive analysis of water Cherenkov detectors and perform physics analyses to efficiently separate Cherenkov and scintillation photons with ML algorithms using the data from the WbLS detector environment. The main goal of this study was to produce more precise solutions to physics problems, such as signal classification, by applying ML techniques to the simulation and experimental data. Here, we trained more than 20 ML models, and our results revealed that three machine learning models, XGBoost, Light GBM, and Random Forest models, and their ensemble model gave us more than 95\% accuracy for separating Cherenkov and scintillation photons with balanced and unbalanced datasets. This is a significant increase in efficiency as compared with the results of the classical method by applying simple time cuts.</description>

      <title>Wavefront shaping simulations with augmented partial factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping can tailor multipath interference to control multiple scattering of waves in complex optical systems. However, full-wave simulations that capture multiple scattering are computationally demanding given the large system size and the large number of input channels. Recently, an "augmented partial factorization" (APF) method was proposed to significantly speed-up such full-wave simulations. In this tutorial, we illustrate how to perform wavefront shaping simulations with the APF method using the open-source frequency-domain electromagnetic scattering solver MESTI. We present the foundational concepts and then walk through four examples: computing the scattering matrix of a slab with random permittivities, open high-transmission channels through disorder, focusing inside disorder with phase conjugation, and reflection matrix computation in a spatial focused-beam basis. The goal is to lower the barrier for researchers to use simulations to explore the rich phenomena enabled by wavefront shaping.</description>

      <title>Propagation in rough waveguides: Forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss here the direct and inverse problems for wave propagation in a waveguide with rough internal surface and arbitrary mean shape. The high degree of multiple scattering inside the waveguide poses significant challenges both for the forward computation and for the recovery of the surface profile, and raises important questions about scattering cross-sections. This paper falls into two parts corresponding to these issues.
  We first apply Left-Right (L-R) operator splitting to calculate the scattered fields in 2- and 3-dimensional waveguides. Using this we illustrate the scattered fields and the effect of surface roughness. In the second part we formulate an algorithm for surface recovery from field measurements along the waveguide axis, which generalises recent work on surfaces in 2 dimensions. This method utilizes forward scattering assumptions in effect by formulating an integral equation in the unknown surface field, treated as a function of the surface. Although discussed in the context of waveguides, the formulae are given in a form applicable to a variety of geometries, with coefficients which will depend on and be determined by each specific application.</description>

      <title>Minimal Pole Representation and Controlled Analytic Continuation of Matsubara Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytical continuation is a central step in the simulation of finite-temperature field theories in which numerically obtained Matsubara data is continued to the real frequency axis for physical interpretation. Numerical analytic continuation is considered to be an ill-posed problem where uncertainties on the Matsubara axis are aplified exponentially. Here, we present a systematic and controlled procedure that approximates any Matsubara function by a minimal pole representation to within a predefined precision. We then show systematic convergence to the exact spectral function on the real axis as a function of our control parameter for a range of physically relevant setups. Our methodology is robust to noise and paves the way towards reliable analytic continuation in many-body theory and, by providing access to the analytic structure of the functions, direct theoretical interpretation of physical properties.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.</description>
