      <title>Direct prediction of saturated neoclassical tearing modes in slab using an equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate for the first time that the nonlinear saturation of neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) can be found directly using a variational principle based on Taylor relaxation, without needing to simulate the intermediate, resistivity-dependent dynamics. As in previous investigations of classical tearing mode saturation (Loizu et al. 2020; Loizu &amp; Bonfiglio 2023), we make use of SPEC (Hudson et al. 2012), an equilibrium solver based on the variational principle of the Multi-Region relaxed MHD, featuring stepped pressure profiles and arbitrary magnetic topology. We work in slab geometry and employ a simple bootstrap current model $J_\textrm{bs} = C \nabla p$ to study the bootstrap-driven tearing modes, scanning over the asymptotic matching parameter $\Delta'$ and the bootstrap current strength. Saturated island widths produced by SPEC agree well with the predictions of an initial value resistive MHD code (Huang &amp; Bhattacharjee 2016) while being orders of magnitude faster to calculate. Additionally, we observe good agreement with a simple analytical Modified Rutherford Equation, without requiring any fitting coefficients. The match is obtained for both linearly unstable classical tearing modes in the presence of bootstrap current, and neoclassical tearing modes, which are linearly stable but nonlinear-unstable due to the effects of the bootstrap current</description>

      <title>Fresnel drag in a moving magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The change in direction of the wavevector and group velocity experienced by a wave refracted at the interface of an anisotropic medium in uniform linear motion are determined analytically. These transmission conditions, which are shown to be consistent with generalized Snell's law written in the laboratory frame, are then used to examine the effect of motion on waves incident on a magnetized plasma. For an incident wave in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field the motion is observed to lead to non negligible deviation of the low-frequency X-mode, as well as to non-symmetrical total reflection angles. These effects are shown to be further complicated when the magnetic field is in the plane formed by the incident wavevector and the medium's velocity, as the anisotropy now competes with the motion-induced drag. Although obtained in simplified configurations, these results suggest that accounting for motion when modeling plasma waves trajectory could be important under certain conditions, calling for a more detailed quantification of the effect of motion in actual diagnostics and plasma control schemes.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron beam formation, vertical motion, termination and wall loads in EU-DEMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway electron loads onto material structures are a major concern for future large tokamaks due to the efficient avalanching at high plasma currents. Here, we perform predictive studies using the JOREK code for a plausible plasma configuration in the European DEMO fusion power plant with focus on a pessimistic scenario in which a multi mega-ampere runaway electron beam is formed. The work first comprises axisymmetric predictions of runaway electron beam formation in a mitigated scenario and of the simultaneous vertical motion of the beam due to loss of position control. The subsequent runaway electron beam termination triggered by a burst of MHD activity during the course of the vertical motion is then simulated in 3D with the runaway electron fluid self-consistently coupled to the MHD modes. Finally, the resulting deposition pattern of the runaway electrons onto wall structures is calculated with a relativistic test particle approach. This way, the suitability of a possible sacrificial limiter concept for the protection of first wall components is assessed.</description>

      <title>The role of the thermal properties of electrons on the dispersion properties of Alfv\'en waves in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The transition from left-hand to right-hand polarized Alfv\'en waves depends on the wavenumber, the ratio of kinetic to magnetic pressure $\beta$, temperature anisotropy, and ion composition of the plasma. Along with the temperature anisotropy, the electron-to-proton temperature ratio $T_e/T_p$ is of great relevance for the characterization of the thermal properties of a plasma. This ratio varies significantly between different space plasma environments. Thus, studying how variations on this ratio affect the polarisation properties of electromagnetic waves becomes highly relevant for our understanding of the dynamics of space plasmas. Aim. We present an extensive study on the effect of the thermal properties of electrons on the behaviour and characteristics of Alfv\'enic waves in fully kinetic linear theory, as well as on the transition from electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) to kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAW). Method. We solve the fully kinetic dispersion relation for oblique electromagnetic waves of the Alfv\'en branch in a homogenous Maxwellian electron-proton plasma. We quantify the effect of the thermal properties of electrons by varying the electron-to-proton temperature ratio for different configurations of the propagation angle, $\beta_p=8\pi nkT_p/B^2$, and wavenumber. Results. We show that the temperature ratio $T_e/T_p$ has strong and non-trivial effects on the polarisation of the Alfv\'enic modes, especially at kinetic scales and $\beta_e+\beta_p&gt;0.5$. We conclude that electron inertia plays an important role in the kinetic scale physics of the KAW in the warm plasma regime, and thus cannot be excluded in hybrid models for computer simulations.</description>

      <title>The study of propagation characteristics of millimeter-wave vortex in magnetized plasma by using FDTD Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is pointed out that millimeter-wave vortex may contribute an efficient plasma heating since it was found that the millimeter-wave vortex can propagate in magnetized plasma even in which the normal plane wave is in cut-off condition. Then, it was assumed that the vortex field was the Laguerre-Gaussian (L-G) mode which is free-space solution, but the generation and stable propagation of the L-G mode vortex are not easy in the millimeter frequency range. On the other hand, it is known that millimeter-wave hybrid mode of cylindrical corrugated waveguide has also vortex property. In this paper, we investigate propagation characteristics of millimeter-wave vortex of a hybrid mode of cylindrical corrugated waveguide in the magnetized plasma by using three dimensional numerical simulations with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.</description>

      <title>Decoupling NO production and UV emission intensity over the E-H mode transition in a low-pressure inductively coupled plasma device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-pressure double-inductively coupled plasma device is used to study the fundamental plasma parameters, plasma chemistry, and UV photon emission from the first excited state of nitric oxide, NO(A), in gas mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. In addition to the gas mixture, rf power and gas pressure are varied, and the E-H mode transition of the inductively coupled plasma is studied specifically. The gas temperature and UV photon emission are measured by optical emission spectroscopy (OES), the absolute density of the nitric oxide electronic ground state by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), as well as electron density and electron temperature by a multipole resonance probe (MRP). A simple collisional-radiative model for UV emission from NO(A) is developed, which takes the measured densities of ground state nitric oxide and electrons, as well as the electron temperature and neutral gas temperature, as input parameters. The results reveal the links between the absolute densities of ground state nitric oxide, the excitation of this species driven by electron impact and collisions with nitrogen metastables, quenching of the nitrogen metastables, and the resulting UV photon emission rate. The density of ground state nitric oxide is shown to increase with power, while the discharge remains in E-mode, and to decrease significantly with the transition into H-mode, when sufficient rf power is deposited in the discharge. Despite the lower densities of ground state nitric oxide in H-mode, the UV photon emission intensity increases continuously with higher rf powers and over the E-H transition. This effect is shown to be caused by increased excitation of NO(A) by nitrogen metastables in H-mode, which is sufficient to overcompensate the decrease in ground state nitric oxide density.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>

      <title>Phase space path integral representation of the dynamic structure factor. Monte Carlo simulation of strongly correlated soft-sphere fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic structure factor (DSF) is a mathematical function that contains information about inter-particle correlations and their time evolution. Mostly the classical molecular dynamics is used to calculate the DSF of the classical systems. On the contrary this article deals with quantum systems and the quantum dynamic structure factor. The Wigner formulation of quantum mechanics was used to derive the path integral representation of the DSF, which is based on the Wiener-Khinchin theorem showing relation of the the power spectrum of a random paths to their correlation function. The $3 {\rm D} $ quantum system of strongly correlated soft-sphere fermions was considered as an interesting physical example.
  The developed Wigner path integral Monte Carlo (WPIMC) approach has been developed to calculate the spin--resolved DSFs, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and other thermodynamic functions in a wide range of density and temperatures. The physical meaning of the peaks arising on the RDFs and DSF have been analyzed and explained by the manifestation of the interference effects of the exchange and interparticle interactions and, as well as, the wave interference between multiple-scattering. This phenomenon in the system of the soft-sphere scatterers may to be the precursor effect of the Anderson localization, which finds its origin in the wave interference between multiple-scattering paths.</description>

      <title>Towards the Use of Anderson Acceleration in Coupled Transport-Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of a magnetically confined fusion plasma over long time periods requires methods that can bridge the difference between transport and turbulent time scales. The nonlinear transport solver, Tango, enables simulations of very long times, in particular to steady state, by advancing each process independently with different time step sizes and couples them through a relaxed iteration scheme. We examine the use of Anderson Acceleration (AA) to reduce the total number of coupling iterations required by interfacing Tango with the AA implementation, including several extensions to AA, provided by the KINSOL nonlinear solver package in SUNDIALS. The ability to easily enable and adjust algorithmic options through KINSOL allows for rapid experimentation to evaluate different approaches with minimal effort. Additionally, we leverage the GPTune library to automate the optimization of algorithmic parameters within KINSOL. We show that AA can enable faster convergence in stiff and very stiff tests cases without noise present and in all cases, including with noisy fluxes, increases robustness and reduces sensitivity to the choice of relaxation strength.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Temperature Ratio in Transrelativistic Unmagnetized Shock Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly magnetized shock waves are paramount to a large diversity of environments, including supernova remnants, blazars, and binary-neutron-star mergers. Understanding the distribution of energy between electrons and ions within these astrophysical shock waves spanning a wide spectrum of velocities is a long-standing challenge. In this study, we present a unified model for the downstream electron temperature within unmagnetized shock waves. Encompassing velocities from Newtonian to relativistic, we probe regimes representative of the gradual deceleration of the forward shock in the late gamma-ray burst afterglow phase, such as GRB 170817A. In our model, heating results from an ambipolar electric field generated by the difference in inertia between electrons and ions, coupled with rapid electron scattering in the decelerating turbulence. Our findings demonstrate that the electron temperature consistently represents $10\%$ of the incoming ion kinetic energy in the shock front frame over the full range of shock velocities.</description>

      <title>Kappa-tail technique: Modeling and application to Solar Energetic Particles observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the kappa-tail fitting technique, which analyzes observations of power-law tails of distributions and energy-flux spectra and connects them to theoretical modeling of kappa distributions, to determine the thermodynamics of the examined space plasma. In particular, we (i) construct the associated mathematical formulation, (ii) prove its decisive lead for determining whether the observed power-law is associated with kappa distributions; and (iii) provide a validation of the technique using pseudo-observations of typical input plasma parameters. Then, we apply this technique to a case-study by determining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for a SEP event observed on April 17, 2021, by the PSP/ISOIS instrument suite onboard PSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of $\sim 1$ MeV and $ \sim 5 \cdot 10^{-7} $ cm$^{-3}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fluid and kinetic studies of tokamak disruptions using Bayesian optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When simulating runaway electron dynamics in tokamak disruptions, fluid models with lower numerical cost are often preferred to more accurate kinetic models. The aim of this work is to compare fluid and kinetic simulations of a large variety of different disruption scenarios in ITER. We consider both non-activated and activated scenarios; for the latter we derive and implement kinetic sources for the Compton scattering and tritium beta decay runaway electron generation mechanisms in our simulation tool DREAM [M. Hoppe et al 2021 Comp. Phys. Commun. 268, 108098]. To achieve a diverse set of disruption scenarios, Bayesian optimization is used to explore a range of massive material injection densities for deuterium and neon. The cost function is designed to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful disruption mitigation based on the runaway current, current quench time and transported fraction of the heat loss. In the non-activated scenarios, we find that fluid and kinetic disruption simulations can have significantly different runaway electron dynamics, due to an overestimation of the runaway seed by the fluid model. The primary cause of this is that the fluid hot-tail generation model neglects superthermal electron transport losses during the thermal quench. In the activated scenarios, the fluid and kinetic models give similar predictions, which can be explained by the significant influence of the activated sources on the RE dynamics and the seed.</description>

Abstract: We solve "half" the problem of finding three-dimensional quasisymmetric magnetic fields that do not necessarily satisfy force balance. This involves determining which hidden symmetries are admissible as quasisymmetries, and then showing explicitly how to construct quasisymmetric magnetic fields given an admissible symmetry. The admissibility conditions take the form of a system of overdetermined nonlinear partial differential equations involving second derivatives of the symmetry's infinitesimal generator.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect Edge Localized Modes in DIII-D from Doppler Backscattering measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In H-mode tokamak plasmas, the plasma is sometimes ejected beyond the edge transport barrier. These events are known as edge localized modes (ELMs). ELMs cause a loss of energy and damage the vessel walls. Understanding the physics of ELMs and by extension, how to detect and mitigate them, is an important challenge. In this paper, we focus on two diagnostic methods $\unicode{x2013}$ D-alpha spectroscopy and Doppler backscattering (DBS). The former detects ELMs by measuring Balmer alpha emission while the latter uses microwave radiation to probe the plasma. DBS has the advantage of having higher temporal resolution and robustness to damage. These advantages of DBS diagnostics may be beneficial for future operational tokamaks and thus data processing techniques for DBS should be developed in preparation. In sight of this, we explore the training of neural networks to detect ELMs from DBS data, using D-alpha data as the ground truth. With shots found in the DIII-D database, the model is trained to classify each time step based on the occurrence of an ELM event. The results are promising. When tested on shots similar to those used for training, the model is capable of consistently achieving a high f1-score of 0.93. This score is a performance metric for imbalanced datasets that ranges between 0 and 1. We evaluate the performance of our neural network on a variety of ELMs $\unicode{x2013}$ grasssy, suppressed, and wide pedestal $\unicode{x2013}$ finding broad applicability. Beyond ELMs, our work demonstrates the wider feasibility of applying neural networks to data from DBS diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) originating from the combined gravito-electrostatic interaction in complex dust molecular clouds (DMCs) is a canonical mechanism leading to the onset of astronomical structure formation dynamics. A generalized semi-analytic model is formulated to explore the effects of the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity, non-thermal (r, q)-distributed electrons, and dust-polarization force on the PMGC stability concurrently. The thermal ions are treated thermo-statistically with the Maxwellian distribution law and the non-thermal electrons with the (r, q)-distribution law. The constitutive partially ionized dust grains are modeled in the fluid fabric. A spherical normal mode analysis yields a generalized linear PMGC dispersion relation. Its oscillatory and propagation characteristics are investigated in a reasonable numerical platform. It is found that an increase in the polarization force and positive EiBI parameter significantly enhances the instability, causing the DMC collapse and vice versa. The electron non-thermality spectral parameters play as vital stabilizing factors, and so on. Its reliability and applicability are finally outlined in light of astronomical predictions previously reported in the literature.</description>
