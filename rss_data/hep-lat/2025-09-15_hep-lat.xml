      <title>Matrix-free Neural Preconditioner for the Dirac Operator in Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear systems arise in generating samples and in calculating observables in lattice quantum chromodynamics~(QCD). Solving the Hermitian positive definite systems, which are sparse but ill-conditioned, involves using iterative methods, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this process, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners. However, constructing useful preconditioners can be challenging, adding additional computational overhead, especially in large linear systems. We propose a framework, leveraging operator learning techniques, to construct linear maps as effective preconditioners. The method in this work does not rely on explicit matrices from either the original linear systems or the produced preconditioners, allowing efficient model training and application in the CG solver. In the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory in 1+1 spacetime dimensions with two degenerate-mass fermions), this preconditioning scheme effectively decreases the condition number of the linear systems and approximately halves the number of iterations required for convergence in relevant parameter ranges. We further demonstrate the framework learns a general mapping dependent on the lattice structure which leads to zero-shot learning ability for the Dirac operators constructed from gauge field configurations of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Sparse modeling study of extracting charmonium spectral functions from lattice QCD at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectral functions extracted from Euclidean-time correlation functions using sparse modeling (SpM). SpM solves inverse problems by considering only the sparsity of the target solution. To assess the applicability of the method, we first test it with mock data that mimic charmonium correlation functions. We show that, while resonance peaks in the spectral functions can be reconstructed using this method, it is difficult to reconstruct transport peaks without further assumptions beyond SpM. Then we extract charmonium spectral functions from correlation functions obtained from lattice QCD at temperatures below and above the critical temperature. We show that this method yields results qualitatively consistent with those obtained using the maximum entropy method, although the transport peak is not obtained clearly. This suggests that the results solely from the assumption of the sparse solution can partially reflect underlying physics.</description>

      <title>$\Xi_c \to \Xi$ Semileptonic Decays: An LCSR View on the Experiment-Lattice Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a light-cone QCD sum rule analysis of the semileptonic decays of $\Xi_c$ baryons, focusing on the channels $\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell$, and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. The transition form factors are calculated within the light-cone QCD sum rules framework, using the distribution amplitudes of the heavy $\Xi_c$ baryons. The obtained form factors are then used to compute the differential and total decay widths, as well as the branching fractions. Our numerical results for the branching fractions are $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell) = (3.73 \pm 1.04)~\%$ , $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \mu^+ \nu_\mu) = (3.59 \pm 1.01)~\%$, $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \ell^+ \nu_\ell) = (11.2 \pm 3.25)~\%$, and $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \mu^+ \nu_\mu) = (10.8 \pm 3.13)~\%$. These results are in good agreement with recent lattice QCD calculations, while being larger than the current experimental measurements and differing from the predictions of other theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>On Casimir effect in Yang-Mills theories in three and four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir energy for the configuration of two parallel plates coupled to nonabelian gauge fields with a Yang-Mills action. We consider both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions in the manifestly gauge-invariant formalism we have pursued over the last several years which allows us to factor out the gauge degrees of freedom. A boundary action in the functional integral, equivalent to the insertion of operators representing the plates, is used to enforce the required boundary conditions for the gauge fields. The result is for a kinematic regime corresponding to the exchange of gluons with a dynamically generated mass. We find good agreement in 2+1 dimensions and reasonable agreement in 3+1 dimensions with lattice-based numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.</description>
