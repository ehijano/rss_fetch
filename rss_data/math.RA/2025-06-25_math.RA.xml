      <title>Properties of the symmetric difference in lattices with complementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric difference in Boolean lattices can be defined in two different but equivalent forms. However, it can be introduced also in every bounded lattice with complementation where these two forms need not coincide. We study lattices with complementation and the variety of such lattices where these two expressions coincide and point out explicitly some interesting subvarieties. Using a result of J. Berman we estimate the size of free algebras in these subvarieties. It is well-known that the symmetric difference is associative in every Boolean lattice. We prove that it is just the property of Boolean lattices, namely the symmetric difference in a lattice with complementation is associative if and only if this lattice is Boolean. Similarly, we prove that a lattice with complementation is Boolean if and only if the symmetric difference satisfies a certain simple identity in two variables. We also characterize lattices with a unary operation satisfying De Morgan's laws.</description>

      <title>Homology and cohomology of crossed products by inverse monoid actions and Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a unital action $\theta $ of an inverse monoid $S$ on an algebra $A$ over a filed $K$ we produce (co)homology spectral sequences which converge to the Hochschild (co)homology of the crossed product $A\rtimes_\theta S$ with values in a bimodule over $A\rtimes_\theta S$. The spectral sequences involve a new kind of (co)homology of the inverse monoid $S,$ which is based on $KS$-modules. The spectral sequences take especially nice form, when $(A\rtimes_\theta S)^e $ is flat as a left (homology case) or right (cohomology case) $A^e$-module, involving also the Hochschild (co)homology of $A.$ Same nice spectral sequences are also obtained if $K$ is a commutative ring, over which $A$ is projective, and $S$ is $E$-unitary. We apply our results to the Steinberg algebra $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ over a field $K$ of an ample groupoid $\mathscr{G},$ whose unit space $\mathscr{G} ^{(0)}$ is compact. In the homology case our spectral sequence collapses on the $p$-axis, resulting in an isomorphism between the Hochschild homology of $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ with values in an $A_K(\mathscr{G})$-bimodule $M$ and the homology of the inverse semigroup of the compact open bisections of $\mathscr{G}$ with values in the invariant submodule of $M.$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a construction of Bell and Rogalski to realize new examples of $\mathbb{Z}^n$-graded simple rings. This construction also generalizes TGWAs of type $(A_1)^n$. In addition to considering basic properties of these algebras, we provide a classification of weight modules in the setting of torsion-free orbits, study their (twisted) tensor products, and provide a simplicity criterion.</description>

      <title>Embedding theorems as a bridge between supertraces and supergeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any algebra herein is intended over a field of characteristic 0. Let $E$ denote the infinite dimensional Grassman algebra. Given a power associative finite dimensional {$\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded-central-simple} $A$ and a supertrace algebra $B$, so that $B$ belongs to the same variety of $A\otimes E$, we study conditions on $B$ so that it can be embedded into $A\otimes\Xi$, where $\Xi$ is a supercommutative algebra, called $A$-universal supermap of $B$, provided $B$ satisfies all the supertrace identities of $A\otimes E$. We use this result in order to relate the formal smoothness of $B$ with that of its $A$-universal supermap.</description>

      <title>The homological spectrum for monoidal triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The authors develop a notion of homological prime spectrum for an arbitrary monoidal triangulated category, ${\mathbf C}$. Unlike the symmetric case due to Balmer, the homological primes of ${\mathbf C}$ are not defined as the maximal Serre ideals of the small module category ${\sf mod}\text{-}{{\mathbf C}}$, or via a noncommutative ring theory inspired version of this construction. Instead, the authors work with an extended comparison map from the Serre prime spectrum $\operatorname{Spc} ({\sf mod}\text{-}{{\mathbf C}})$ to the Balmer spectrum $\operatorname{Spc}{\mathbf C}$, and select the maximal elements of each fiber to define the homological spectrum $\operatorname{Spc}^{\text{h}}{\mathbf C}$.
  A surjective continuous homological comparison map $\operatorname{Spc}^{\text{h}}{\mathbf C} \to \operatorname{Spc}{\mathbf C}$ is constructed and used to formulate an extended Nerves of Steel Conjecture stating that this map is a homeomorphism. The conjecture is proved to hold under stratification and uniformity conditions on ${\mathbf C}$. The proof is based on a general theorem giving an explicit description of the Balmer--Favi support of the pure-injectives associated to all Serre primes of ${\sf mod}\text{-}{{\mathbf C}}$. It is shown that the validity of the conjecture carries over from ${\mathbf C}$ to a semidirect product ${\mathbf C} \rtimes G$ with an arbitrary group $G$, and when $G$ is infinite, this provides examples of monoidal triangulated categories satisfying the conjecture and whose thick ideals are not centrally generated. Important cases in which the conjecture is verified include the stable module categories of the coordinate rings of all finite group schemes and the Benson--Witherspoon Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>An Application of Maximality to Nilpotent and Finitely Generated L-Subgroups of an L-Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the study on maximal and Frattini L-subgroups of an L-group. The normality of the maximal L-subgroups of a nilpotent L-group is explored. Then, the concept of finitely generated L-subgroup is introduced and its relation with maximal condition on L-subgroups is established. Thereafter, several results pertaining to the notions of Frattini L-subgroup and finitely generated L-subgroups have been investigated.</description>

      <title>Computing finite index congruences of finitely presented semigroups and monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe an algorithm for computing the left, right, or 2-sided congruences of a finitely presented semigroup or monoid with finitely many classes, and an alternative algorithm when the finitely presented semigroup or monoid is finite. We compare the two algorithms presented with existing algorithms and implementations. The first algorithm is a generalization of Sims' low-index subgroup algorithm for finding the congruences of a monoid. The second algorithm involves determining the distinct principal congruences, and then finding all of their possible joins. Variations of this algorithm have been suggested in numerous contexts by numerous authors. We show how to utilize the theory of relative Green's relations, and a version of Schreier's Lemma for monoids, to reduce the number of principal congruences that must be generated as the first step of this approach. Both of the algorithms described in this paper are implemented in the GAP package Semigroups, and the first algorithm is available in the C++ library libsemigroups and in its python bindings libsemigroups_pybind11.</description>

      <title>Nil modules and the envelope of a submodule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring and $N$ be a submodule of an $R$-module $M$. The submodule $\langle E_M(N)\rangle$ generated by the envelope $E_M(N)$ of $N$ is instrumental in studying rings and modules that satisfy the radical formula. We show that: 1) the semiprime radical is an invariant on all the submodules which are respectively generated by envelopes in the ascending chain of envelopes of a given submodule; 2) for rings that satisfy the radical formula, $\langle E_M(0)\rangle$ is an idempotent radical and it induces a torsion theory whose torsion class consists of all nil $R$-modules and the torsionfree class consists of all reduced $R$-modules; and 3) Noetherian uniserial modules satisfy the semiprime radical formula and their semiprime radical is a nil module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a ring is strongly (resp. weakly) left Jacobson if every semiprime (resp. prime) left ideal is an intersection of maximal left ideals. There exist Jacobson rings that are not weakly left Jacobson, e.g. the Weyl algebra. Our main result is the following one-sided noncommutative Nullstellensatz: For any finite-dimensional F-algebra A the ring A[$x_1$,...,$x_n$] of polynomials with coefficients in A is strongly left Jacobson and every maximal left ideal of A[$x_1$,...,$x_n$] has finite codimension. We also prove that an Azumaya algebra is strongly left Jacobson iff its center is Jacobson and that an algebra that is a finitely generated module over its center is weakly left Jacobson iff it is Jacobson.</description>

Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers highlighting the applications of reduced and coreduced modules. Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring and $I$ be an ideal of $R$. We give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of $I$-reduced and $I$-coreduced $R$-modules for the functor $\text{Hom}_R(R/I, -)$ on the abelian full subcategory of the category of $R$-modules to be a radical. These conditions further provide a setting for the generalisation of Jans' correspondence, and lead to a new radical class of rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every $n$-tuple in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ has a first non-zero entry and a last non-zero entry. What do the positions of such entries in the elements of a subspace W of $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ reveal about W? It turns out, a great deal! This insight offers a beeline to the fundamental results on general bases and dimension (including dimensions of complements, rank of a transpose, Rank-Nullity Theorem, Full Rank Factorization, and existence/uniqueness of RREF), bypassing some of the traditional stumbling blocks and time sinks.</description>

      <title>Endocabling of involutive solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, with an application to solutions whose diagonal is a cyclic permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce endocabling as a technique to deform involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation (``solutions'', for short) by means of $\lambda$-endomorphisms of their associated permutation brace, thus generalizing the cabling method by Lebed, Vendramin and Ram\'{i}rez. In the first part of the article, we define endocabling and investigate the behaviour of solutions and their invariants under endocabling. In the second part, we apply our findings to solutions of size $n$ whose diagonal map is an $n$-cycle: we will prove that solutions with this property whose size is an odd prime power, are of finite multipermutation level. Furthermore, solutions with this property whose size is a power of $2$, will be proven either to be of finite multipermutation level or to admit an iterated retraction onto a unique solution of size $4$.
  We formulate our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>

      <title>Groups of $\mathrm{I}_G$-type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address a question posed by Dehornoy et al. in the book "Foundations of Garside Theory" that asks for a theory of groups of $\mathrm{I}_G$-type when $G$ is a Garside group. In this article, we introduce a broader notion than the one suggested by Dehornoy et al.: given a left-ordered group $G$, we define a group of $\mathrm{I}_G$-type as a left-ordered group whose partial order is isomorphic to those of $G$. Furthermore, we develop methods to give a characterization of groups of $\mathrm{I}_{\Gamma}$-type in terms of skew braces when $\Gamma$ is an Artin-Tits group of spherical type and classify all groups of $\mathrm{I}_{\Gamma}$-type where $\Gamma$ is an irreducible spherical Artin-Tits group, therefore providing an answer to another question of Dehornoy et al. concerning $\mathrm{I}_{B_n}$ structures where $B_n$ is the braid group on $n$ strands with its canonical Garside structure.</description>

      <title>A matrix criterion and algorithmic approach for the Peterson hit problem: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [15] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [15].</description>
