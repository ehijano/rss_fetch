      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_p$-torus actions on positively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider closed, positively curved $n$-manifolds admitting an isometric and effective $\mathbb{Z}_p^r$-action with a fixed point, with $p$ a prime, classifying such manifolds up to homotopy equivalence when $r$ satisfies the lower bound given in our main theorem and $p \in \{3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29\}$. In particular, for $p=3$ and $n\geq 1908$, we show that $r&gt;9n/32$. The lower bound we find for this range of primes represents an improvement over the approximately $3n/8$ bound found by Fang and Rong in even dimensions and by Ghazawneh in odd dimensions. To obtain this result, we derive a finite-length Elias-Bassalygo bound for $q$-ary codes that is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sharp Spectral Gap Estimates on Manifolds under Integral Ricci Curvature Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp spectral gap estimates on compact manifolds with integral curvature bounds. We generalize the results of Kr\"oger (Kr\"oger '92) as well as of Bakry and Qian (Bakry-Qian '00) to the case of integral curvature and confirm the conjecture in (Ramos et al. '20) for the case $n \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Lens rigidity in 2D: The reconstruction of a Riemann surface from its geodesic lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of whether a Riemannian manifold-with-boundary (M,g) in dimension two is uniquely determined from knowledge of the distances between points on its boundary. An affirmative answer is called boundary rigidity for (M,g); it is closely related to lens rigidity. The latter question originates in the problem of reconstructing the speed of sound in an unknown medium from measurements of the travel time of sound waves that are sent in and ultimately return to the boundary. We prove essentially optimal results on these rigidity questions:
  Our first result answers proves rigidity locally, near a convex portion of the boundary. Our second result proves rigidity globally, for manifolds with convex boundary, in the absence of trapping (closed geodesics), thus confirming a conjecture of Uhlmann. Our final result proves the optimal reconstruction for convex boundaries even in the presence of trapping, showing rigidity up to outermost trapped geodesics.
  Our results thus extend the classical work of Pestov and Uhlmann on rigidity of simple 2-manifolds, as well as the many prior results on injectivity of the X-ray transform, which address linearized versions of the rigidity problem. \par Our method is to treat the (non-linear) rigidity problem directly, where we simultaneously re-cast the lens data as generalized Riemannian circles, and obtain rigidity for these ``pseudo-circles'', by studying a system of equations that we show these objects must satisfy. The rigidity we obtain ultimately is proven via {novel} estimates that are reminiscent of energy-type estimates for hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Local noncommutative De Leeuw Theorems beyond reductive Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup of a unimodular locally compact group $G$. In Math. Ann. 388, 4251-4305 (2024), it was shown that the $L_p$ norm of a Fourier multiplier $m$ on $\Gamma$ can be bounded locally by its $L_p$-norm on $G$, modulo a constant $c(A)$ which depends on the support $A$ of $m$. In the context where $G$ is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we develop tools to find explicit bounds on $c(A)$. We show that the problem reduces to:
  1) The adjoint representation of the semisimple quotient $\mathfrak{s} = \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ by the radical $\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ (which was handled in the paper mentioned above).
  2) The action of $\mathfrak{s}$ on a set of real irreducible representations that arise from quotients of the commutator series of $\mathfrak{r}$.
  In particular, we show that $c(G) = 1$ for unimodular connected solvable Lie groups.</description>

      <title>$m$-Pseudo-effectivity and a Monge-Amp\`ere-Type Equation for Forms of Positive Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $n$-dimensional compact K\"ahler manifold, we continue our study of $m$-positivity in two ways. We first propose generalisations of the notions of pseudo-effective and big Bott-Chern cohomology classes of bidegree $(1,\,1)$ by relaxing the standard positivity hypotheses to their $m$-counterparts after we have proved a Lamari-type duality lemma in bidegree $(m,\,m)$. Independently, we propose a Monge-Amp\`ere-type non-linear pde whose distinctive feature is that its solutions, if any, are forms of positive degree rather than functions. We prove a form of uniqueness for the solutions and, under the assumption that a solution exists, we give a geometric application involving the $m$-bigness notion introduced in the first part.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic curvature via Jacobi-Maupertuis and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of electromagnetic systems, we propose a new definition of electromagnetic Ricci curvature, naturally derived via the classical Jacobi-Maupertuis reparametrization from the recent works of Assenza [IMRN, 2024] and Assenza, Marshall Reber, Terek [Communications in Mathematical Physics, 2025]. On closed manifolds, we show that if the magnetic force is nowhere vanishing and the potential is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ norm, then this Ricci curvature is positive for energies close to the maximum value of the potential $e_0$. As a main application, under these assumptions, we extend the existence of contractible closed orbits at energy levels near $e_0$ from almost every to everywhere.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs: A perspective towards nonequilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more. In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.</description>

      <title>Differential Models for Anderson Dual to Twisted $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-Bordism and Twisted Anomaly Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct differential models for twisted $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-bordism and for its Anderson dual, and employ the latter to define a twisted anomaly map whose source is the differential twisted $K$-theory. Our differential model for the twisted Anderson dual follows the formalism developed in [YY23]. To connect these constructions with the geometric framework of the Atiyah-Singer index theory, we further present a gerbe-theoretic formulation of our models in terms of bundle gerbes and gerbe modules [Mur96] [BCMMS02].
  Within this geometric setting, we define the twisted anomaly map \[ \widehat{\Phi}_{\widehat{\mathcal{G}}}\colon
  \widehat{K}^{0}(X,\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{-1})
  \longrightarrow
  \bigl(\widehat{I\Omega^{\mathrm{Spin}^c}_{\mathrm{dR}}}\bigr)^{n}(X,\widehat{\mathcal{G}}), \] whose construction naturally involves the reduced eta-invariant of Dirac operators acting on Clifford modules determined by the twisted data. Conceptually, this map is expected to encode the anomalies of twisted $1|1$-dimensional supersymmetric field theories, in accordance with the perspectives developed in [ST11] and [FH21].</description>

      <title>Regularity for quasilinear elliptic equations in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article we prove second-order and Lipschitz regularity for quasilinear elliptic equations in metric spaces endowed with a lower bound on the Ricci curvature. The estimates we obtain are quantitative and cover a large class of elliptic equations with polynomial growth. As a particular case we settle the Lipschitz regularity of $p$-harmonic functions for all values of $p\in(1,\infty)$, proving also a Cheng-Yau type inequality. These results are the first in this setting that simultaneously address a wide family of elliptic operators and extend beyond the classical H\"older regularity theory. Our strategy rests on the use of Galerkin's method, which we employ as an alternative to the traditional difference quotients technique.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new systems of PDE on initial data sets $(M,g,k)$ whose solutions model double-null foliations. This allows us to generalize Geroch's monotonicity formula for the Hawking mass under inverse mean curvature flow to initial data sets satisfying the dominant energy condition. We study the existence theory of these systems and give geometric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the notion of quasi-isometry between two Riemannian manifolds has been introduced. This idea is also imposed to study quasi-isometry between two almost contact metric manifolds. Moving further, some curvature properties of two quasi-isometrically embedded almost contact metric manifolds, $N(k)-$contact metric manifolds and Sasakian manifolds are investigated. Next, an illustrative example of a quasi-isometry between two Sasakian structures is constructed. Finally, a relation between the scalar curvature and the quasi-isometric constants for two quasi-isometric Riemannian manifolds has been established.</description>

      <title>Geometric Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for integer Quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for an integer Quantum Hall state. Given an effective reduced divisor on a compact connected Riemann surface, using the canonical holomorphic section of the associated canonical line bundle as well as certain initial data and local normalisation data, we construct a canonical non-zero element in the determinant line of the cohomology of the $p$-tensor power of the line bundle.
  When endowed with proper metric data, the square of the $ L^{2} $-norm of our canonical element is the partition function associated to an integer Quantum Hall state. We establish an asymptotic expansion for the logarithm of the partition function when $ p\to +\infty$. The constant term of this expansion includes the holomorphic analytic torsion and matches a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann's prediction.
  Our proof relies on Bismut-Lebeau's embedding formula for the Quillen metrics, Bismut-Vasserot and Finski's asymptotic expansion for the analytic torsion associated to the higher tensor product of a positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factorization structures occur in toric differential and discrete geometry, and can be viewed in multiple ways, e.g., as objects determining substantial classes of explicit toric Sasaki and K\"ahler geometries, as special coordinates on such, or as an apex generalisation of cyclic polytopes featuring a generalised Gale's evenness condition. This article presents a comprehensive study of factorization structures. It establishes their structure theory and introduces their use in the geometry of cones and polytopes. The article explains the construction of polytopes and cones compatible with a given factorization structure, and exemplifies it for product Segre-Veronese and Veronese factorization structures, where the latter case includes cyclic polytopes. Further, it derives the generalised Gale's evenness condition for compatible cones, polytopes and their duals, and explicitly describes faces of these. Factorization structures naturally provide generalised Vandermonde identities, which relate normals of any compatible polytope, and which are used for Veronese factorization structure to find examples of Delzant and rational Delzant compatible polytopes. The article offers a myriad of factorization structure examples, which are later characterised to be precisely factorization structures with decomposable curves, and raises the question if these encompass all factorization structures, i.e., the existence of an indecomposable factorization curve.</description>

      <title>Random Systems of Holomorphic Sections of a Sequence of Line bundles on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes an asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$ in a general non-Gaussian setting. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmic decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent for unbounded convex functions on Hadamard manifolds and its applications to scaling problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of continuous- and discrete-time gradient flows of a ``lower-unbounded" convex function $f$ on a Hadamard manifold $M$, particularly, their convergence properties to the boundary $M^{\infty}$ at infinity of $M$. We establish a duality theorem that the infimum of the gradient-norm $\|\nabla f(x)\|$ of $f$ over $M$ is equal to the supremum of the negative of the recession function $f^{\infty}$ of $f$ over the boundary $M^{\infty}$, provided the infimum is positive. Further, the infimum and the supremum are obtained by the limit of the gradient flow of $f$. Our results feature convex-optimization ingredients of the moment-weight inequality for reductive group actions by Georgoulas, Robbin, and Salamon, and are applied to noncommutative optimization by B\"urgisser et al. FOCS 2019. We show that gradient descent of the Kempf-Ness function for an unstable orbit converges to a destabilizing 1-parameter subgroup in the Hilbert-Mumford criterion, and the associated moment-map sequence converges to the minimum-norm point of the moment polytope. We show further refinements for operator scaling -- the left-right action on a matrix tuple $A= (A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N)$. We characterize the gradient-flow limit of operator scaling by a vector-space generalization of the classical Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition of a bipartite graph. For a special case of $N = 2$, we reveal that the limit determines the Kronecker canonical form of a matrix pencil $s A_1+A_2$.</description>

      <title>Stolz Positive Scalar Curvature Structure Groups, Proper Actions and Equivariant 2-Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study equivariant versions of Stolz' $R$-groups, the positive scalar curvature structure groups $R^{\rm spin}_n(X)^G$, for proper actions of discrete groups $G$. We define the concept of a fundamental groupoid functor for a $G$-space, encapsulating all the fundamental group information of all the fixed point sets and their relations. We construct classifying spaces for fundamental groupoid functors. As a geometric result, we show that Stolz' equivariant $R$-group $R^{\rm spin}_n(X)^G$ depends only on the fundamental groupoid functor of the reference space $X$. The proof covers at the same time in a concise and clear way the classical non-equivariant case.</description>

      <title>Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis: Information Geometry Approach for Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction maps labeled data into a low-dimensional feature space while preserving class discriminability. A common approach is to maximize a statistical measure of dissimilarity between classes in the feature space. Information geometry provides an alternative framework for measuring class dissimilarity, with the potential for improved insights and novel applications. Information geometry, which is grounded in Riemannian geometry, uses the Fisher information metric, a local measure of discriminability that induces the Fisher-Rao distance. Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a linear dimensionality reduction method that maximizes Fisher-Rao distances between class-conditional distributions, under Gaussian assumptions. We motivate the Fisher-Rao distance as a good proxy for discriminability. We show that SQFA features support good classification performance with Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) on three real-world datasets. SQFA provides a novel framework for supervised dimensionality reduction, motivating future research in applying information geometry to machine learning and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>A nongraphical obstacle problem for elastic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an obstacle problem for the length-penalized elastic bending energy for open planar curves pinned at the boundary. We first consider the case without length penalization and investigate the role of global minimizers among graph curves in our minimization problem for planar curves. In addition, for large values of the length-penalization parameter $\lambda&gt;0$, we expose an explicit threshold parameter above which minimizers touch the obstacle, regardless of its shape. On contrary, for small values of $\lambda&gt;0$ we show that the minimizers do not touch the obstacle, and they are given by an explicit elastica.</description>

      <title>Density-Aware Noise Mechanisms for Differential Privacy on Riemannian Manifolds via Conformal Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) enables privacy-preserving data analysis by adding calibrated noise. While recent works extend DP to curved manifolds such as diffusion-tensor MRI or social networks by adding geodesic noise, these assume uniform data distribution and are not always practical. Hence, these approaches may introduce biased noise and suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for non-uniform data. To address these shortcomings, we develop a density-aware differential privacy mechanism based on conformal transformations over Riemannian manifolds, which calibrates perturbations according to local density while preserving intrinsic geometric structure. We construct the conformal factor based on local kernel density estimates and establish that it inherently adapts to variations in data density. Our mechanism achieves a local balance of sample density and redefines geodesic distances while faithfully preserving the intrinsic geometry of the underlying manifold. We demonstrate that, through conformal transformation, our mechanism satisfies epsilon-differential privacy on any complete Riemannian manifold and derives a closed-form expected geodesic error bound that is contingent solely on the maximal density ratio, independent of global curvature. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our mechanism substantially improves the privacy-utility tradeoff in heterogeneous manifold settings and remains on par with state-of-the-art approaches when data are uniformly distributed.</description>
