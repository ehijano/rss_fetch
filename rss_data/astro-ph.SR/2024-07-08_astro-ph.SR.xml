      <title>Supernova Shocks Cannot Explain the Inflated State of Hypervelocity Runaways from White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have found a growing number of hypervelocity stars with speeds of $\approx 1500-2500\,$km\,s$^{-1}$ which could have only been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Most of the observed hypervelocity runaways in this class display a surprising inflated structure: their current radii are roughly an order of magnitude greater than they would have been as white dwarfs filling their Roche lobe. While many simulations exist studying the dynamical phase leading to supernova detonation in these systems, no detailed calculations of the long-term structure of the runaways have yet been performed. We use an existing \textsc{Arepo} hydrodynamical simulation of a supernova in a white dwarf binary as a starting point for the evolution of these stars with the 1 dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We show that the supernova shock is not enough to inflate the white dwarf over timescales longer than a few thousand years, significantly shorter than the $10^{5-6}$ year lifetimes inferred for observed hypervelocity runaways. Despite experiencing a shock from a supernova less than $\approx 0.02\,R_\odot$ away, our models do not experience significant interior heating, and all contract back to radii around $0.01\,R_\odot$ within about $10^4$\,years. Explaining the observed inflated states requires either an additional source of significant heating or some other physics that is not yet accounted for in the subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Planet Formation and Disk Chemistry: Dust and Gas Evolution during Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, progress in observational capabilities, combined with theoretical advancements, have transformed our comprehension of the physics and chemistry during planet formation. Despite these important steps forward, open questions persist on the chemical and physical evolution of solids in their journey from the collapsing molecular cores to disks and planetary bodies. This chapter is a repository of such burning questions. It has the ambition to identify the most promising avenues for future research based on current observational and modeling opportunities.</description>

      <title>Isochrone fitting to the open cluster M67 in the era of Gaia and improved model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has provided highly accurate observations that have significantly reduced the scatter in the colour-magnitude diagrams of open clusters. As a result of the improved isochrone sequence of the open cluster M67, we have created new stellar models that avoid commonly used simplifications in 1D stellar modelling, such as mass-independent core overshooting and a constant mixing length parameter. This has enabled us to deliver a precise isochrone specifically designed for M67, available for download. We follow a commonly used qualitative approach to adjust the input physics to match the well-defined colour-magnitude sequence, and we test the model-predicted masses against a known eclipsing binary system at the main sequence turnoff of the cluster. Despite using improvements in photometry and stellar physics we cannot match the masses of both binary components with the same theoretical isochrone. A chi-square-based isochrone fitting approach using our preferred input physics results in a cluster age of 3.95+0.16-0.15 Gyrs.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic oscillations of flare loops and slipping motion of ribbon substructures during a C-class flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic oscillations in solar flaring emission have been observed over the past few decades. To date, the underpinning processes resulting in the quasi-periodic oscillations remain unknown. In this paper, we report a unique event that exhibits both the long-duration quasi-periodic intensity oscillations of flare loops and the quasi-periodic slipping motion of ribbon substructures during a C9.1-class flare (SOL2015-03-15-T01:15), using the observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The high-temperature flare loops rooted in the straight part of ribbons display a "bright-dim" intensity oscillation, with a period of about 4.5 minutes. The oscillation starts just after the flare onset and lasts over 3 hours. Meanwhile, the substructures within the ribbon tip display the quasi-periodic slipping motion along the ribbon at 1400 \AA images which has a similar periodicity to the stationary intensity oscillation of the flare loops in the straight part of the flare ribbons. We suggest that the quasi-periodic pattern is probably related to the loop-top dynamics caused by the reconnection outflow impinging on the flare loops.</description>

      <title>Measuring stellar surface rotation and activity with the PLATO mission -- I. Strategy and application to simulated light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars mission (PLATO) will allow us to measure surface rotation and monitor photometric activity of tens of thousands of main sequence solar-type and subgiant stars. This paper is the first of a series dedicated to the preparation of the analysis of stellar surface rotation and photospheric activity with the near-future PLATO data. We describe in this work the strategy that will be implemented in the PLATO pipeline to measure stellar surface rotation, photometric activity, and long-term modulations. The algorithms are applied on both noise-free and noisy simulations of solar-type stars, which include activity cycles, latitudinal differential rotation, and spot evolution. PLATO simulated systematics are included in the noisy light curves. We show that surface rotation periods can be recovered with confidence for most of the stars with only six months of observations and that the {recovery rate} of the analysis significantly improves as additional observations are collected. This means that the first PLATO data release will already provide a substantial set of measurements for this quantity, with a significant refinement on their quality as the instrument obtains longer light curves. Measuring the Schwabe-like magnetic activity cycle during the mission will require that the same field be observed over a significant timescale (more than four years). Nevertheless, PLATO will provide a vast and robust sample of solar-type stars with constraints on the activity-cycle length. Such a sample is lacking from previous missions dedicated to space photometry.</description>

      <title>New O-Cs for the Classical Cepheids RY Cas and V Lac over a Century (1873-2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give here new O-C diagrams of the two classical Cepheids RY Cas and V Lac, established on a large basis of times of maximum of light, which covers more than a century. These two Cepheids present a variation of their period for which it is possible to calculate an annual rate. This rate equals +1.86 s/yr for RY Cas and -0.81 s/yr for V Lac. Based on these two new O-C diagrams neither of them seems to show any association to a binary system.</description>

      <title>Testing a non-local 1-equation turbulent convection model: A solar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent convection models treat stellar convection more physically than standard mixing-length theory by including non-local effects. We recently successfully applied the Kuhfuss version to convective cores in main sequence stars. Its usefulness for convective envelopes remains to be tested. The solar convective envelope constitutes a viable test bed for investigating the usefulness of the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model. We used the one-dimensional stellar evolution code GARSTEC to calculate a standard solar model with the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model, and compared it to helioseismic measurements and a solar model using standard mixing-length theory. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the additional free parameters of the convection model on the solar structure. The 1-equation Kuhfuss model reproduces the sound-speed profile and the lower boundary of the convective region less well than the mixing-length model, because the inherent non-local effects overestimate the amount of convective penetration below the Schwarzschild boundary. We trace this back to the coupling of the temperature gradient to the convective flux in the 1-equation version of the Kuhfuss theory. The temperature stratification of the solar convective envelope is not well modelled by the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model, and the more complex 3-equation version is needed to improve the modelling of convection in the envelopes of 1D stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Unexpected frequency of horizontal oscillations of magnetic structures in the solar photosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the dominant frequency of oscillations in the solar photosphere is $\approx$3 mHz, which is the result of global resonant modes pertaining to the whole stellar structure. However, analyses of the horizontal motions of nearly 1 million photospheric magnetic elements spanning the entirety of solar cycle 24 have revealed an unexpected dominant frequency, $\approx$5 mHz, a frequency typically synonymous with the chromosphere. Given the distinctly different physical properties of the magnetic elements examined in our statistical sample, when compared to largely quiescent solar plasma where $\approx$3 mHz frequencies are omnipresent, we argue that the dominant $\approx$5 mHz frequency is not caused by the buffeting of magnetic elements, but instead is due to the nature of the underlying oscillatory driver itself. This novel result was obtained by exploiting the unmatched spatial and temporal coverage of magnetograms acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our findings provide a timely avenue for future exploration of the magnetic connectivity between sub-photospheric, photospheric, and chromospheric layers of the Sun's dynamic atmosphere.</description>

      <title>SDSSJ0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN 1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN 1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN 1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN 1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN 1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN 1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN 1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN 1a are and possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Properties of observable mixed inertial/gravito-inertial modes in {\gamma} Doradus stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In {\gamma} Doradus ({\gamma} Dor) stars, gravito-inertial modes in the radiative zone and inertial modes in the convective core can interact resonantly, which translates into the appearance of dip structures in the period spacing of modes. Those dips are information-rich as they are related to the star core characteristics. We aim at characterising these dips according to stellar properties and thus developing new seismic diagnostic tools to constrain the internal structure of {\gamma} Dor stars, especially their core. We used the two-dimensional oscillation code TOP to compute sectoral prograde and axisymmetric dipolar modes in {\gamma} Dor stars at different rotation rates and evolutionary stages. We then characterised the dips we obtained by their width and location on the period spacing diagram. We found that the width and the location of the dips depend quasi-linearly on the ratio of the rotation rate and the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency at the core interface. This allowed us to determine empirical relations between width and location of dips on the one hand, and on the other, resonant inertial mode frequency in the core and Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency at the core/radiative zone interface. We also propose an approximate theoretical model to support and discuss these empirical relations. The empirical relations we established could be applied to dips observed in data, which would allow for the estimate of frequencies of resonant inertial modes in the core and of the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a jump at the interface between the core and the radiative zone. As those two parameters are both related to the evolutionary stage of the star, their determination could lead to more accurate estimations of stellar ages.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XII. A new grid of northern standards for the spectral classification of B-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, automated stellar parameter determination has become commonplace. Nevertheless, spectral classification still offers a quick and useful alternative for obtaining parameter estimates for large samples of spectra of varying quality. We present a new atlas of stellar spectra covering the B-type range, with the intention of providing detailed classification criteria valid for modern spectra and improving the grid of reliable standards. This new grid will be used in future works to provide classification criteria beyond the classical classification range and addressing, in particular, the use of Gaia/RVS spectra. We analysed historical standards by means of multiple high-resolution spectra, marking out problematic cases and complementing the grid with a new set of reliable comparators. We then elaborated on a new set of classification criteria based on high-quality R=4000 spectra. Our new classification grid is much thicker than any previous set of standards, presenting a high degree of self-consistency. Although it is based entirely on morphological criteria, the grid demonstrates a much better correlation with different physical parameters. The new grid can be used to study classification criteria in other spectral ranges, providing a valuable tool for the study of B-type stars that covers a very wide range of temperatures, luminosities, and stellar masses. The very process of classification also offers valuable insights into stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>The SOHO LASCO CME Catalog -- Version 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an update on the coronal mass ejection (CME) catalog maintained at the CDAW Data Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list). This is version 2 (v2) of the Catalog that has been made as the default version as of May 1, 2024. The new features of the Catalog v2 are (i) online measurement tool, (ii) combination JavaScript movies from the STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions, and (iii) insertion of newly identified CMEs for the period 1996 to 2004. The CME identification was revisited resulting in a set of $\sim$3000 new CMEs added to the Catalog. A vast majority of these CMEs are weak and narrow. The resulting statistical properties of CMEs are not significantly different from those reported using version 1.</description>

      <title>Kappa-tail technique: Modeling and application to Solar Energetic Particles observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the kappa-tail fitting technique, which analyzes observations of power-law tails of distributions and energy-flux spectra and connects them to theoretical modeling of kappa distributions, to determine the thermodynamics of the examined space plasma. In particular, we (i) construct the associated mathematical formulation, (ii) prove its decisive lead for determining whether the observed power-law is associated with kappa distributions; and (iii) provide a validation of the technique using pseudo-observations of typical input plasma parameters. Then, we apply this technique to a case-study by determining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for a SEP event observed on April 17, 2021, by the PSP/ISOIS instrument suite onboard PSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of $\sim 1$ MeV and $ \sim 5 \cdot 10^{-7} $ cm$^{-3}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey DR5.1 and Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec: a comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) The third data release of Gaia, has provided stellar parameters, metallicity [M/H], [{\alpha}/Fe], individual abundances, broadening parameter from its RVS spectra for about 5.6 million objects thanks to the GSP-Spec module. The catalogue publishes the radial velocity of 33 million sources. We took advantage of the intersections between Gaia RVS and Gaia-ESO to compare their stellar parameters, abundances and radial and rotational velocities. We aimed at verifying the overall agreement between the two datasets, considering the various calibrations and the quality-control flag system suggested for the Gaia GSP-Spec parameters. For the targets in common between Gaia RVS and Gaia-ESO, we performed several statistical checks on the distributions of their stellar parameters, abundances and velocities of targets in common. For the Gaia surface gravity and metallicity we considered both the uncalibrated and calibrated values. We find an excellent agreement between the Gaia and Gaia-ESO radial velocities given the uncertainties affecting each dataset. Less than 25 of ~2100 Gaia-ESO spectroscopic binaries are flagged as non-single stars by Gaia. The temperature scales are in good agreement. The calibrated GSP-Spec gravity should be preferred. We note that the quality (accuracy, precision) of the GSP-Spec parameters degrades quickly for objects fainter than G~11. We find that the somewhat imprecise GSP-Spec abundances due to its medium-resolution spectroscopy over a short wavelength window and the faint G regime of the sample under study can be counterbalanced by working with averaged quantities. We studied some properties of the open-cluster population: our combined sample traces very well the radial [Fe/H] and [Ca/Fe] gradients, the age-metallicity relations in different radial regions, and it places the clusters in the thin disc.</description>

      <title>Relationship between TIGRE solar S-index and USET Ca II K full disk images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full disk observations of the solar chromosphere in the Ca II K line represent a valuable dataset for studies of solar magnetic activity. The S-index is widely used to investigate the magnetic activity of stars, however, its connection to the coverage of stellar magnetic structure is still poorly understood. We use the archives of full disk Ca II K images taken by the Royal Observatory of Belgium with the USET to derive the area fraction of the brightest chromospheric structures over the last decade. These data allowed us to study the end of the solar cycle 24 and the beginning of solar cycle 25. The brightest regions of the solar surface were then segmented using an algorithm based on an intensity threshold. We computed the area fraction over the solar disk and compared it with the S-index from TIGRE. For the detection of periodic modulations, we applied a discrete Fourier power spectrum method to both datasets. A tight linear relationship was found between the USET area fraction and the TIGRE S-index, with an improved correlation obtained in the low-activity regime by considering the enhanced network. In both time series, we detected the modulation caused by the rotation of bright structures on the solar disk. However, this detection is constrained in the case of TIGRE due to its observation strategy. We studied the correlation between the disk coverage with chromospheric structures and the variability of the S-index on an overlapping period of ten years. We concluded that the disk coverage index is a good proxy for the S-index and will be useful in future studies of the magnetic activity of solar-type stars. The USET area fraction dataset is most appropriate for evaluating the solar rotation period and will be used in future works to analyze the impact of the inclination of the stellar rotation axis on the detectability of such periodic modulations in solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopic and kinematic survey of fast hot subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarfs (sdO/B) are the stripped helium cores of red giants formed by binary interactions. Close hot subdwarf binaries with massive white dwarf companions have been proposed as possible progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). If the supernova is triggered by stable mass transfer from the helium star, the companion should survive the explosion and should be accelerated to high velocities. The hypervelocity star US 708 is regarded as the prototype for such an ejected companion. To find more of those objects we conducted an extensive spectroscopic survey. Candidates for such fast stars have been selected from the spectroscopic database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and several ground-based proper motion surveys. Follow-up spectroscopy has been obtained with several 4m- to 10m-class telescopes. Combining the results from quantitative spectroscopic analyses with space-based astrometry from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) we determined the atmospheric and kinematic parameters of 53 fast hot subdwarf stars. None of these stars is unbound to the Galaxy, although some have Galactic restframe velocities close to the Galactic escape velocity. 21 stars are apparently single objects, which crossed the Galactic disc within their lifetimes in the sdO/B stage and could be regarded as potential candidates for the SN Ia ejection scenario. However, the properties of the full sample are more consistent with a pure old Galactic halo population. We therefore conclude that the fast sdO/B stars we found are likely to be extreme halo stars.</description>

      <title>Implications of the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections for the strength of solar cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the relative strength of solar cycle (SC) 25 with respect to SCs 23 and 24 based on the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We make use of the halo CME database (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/halo/halo.html) to compare the halo CME abundance during the first four years in each of SCs 23 to 25. The main result is that in several aspects such as the abundance, occurrence rate, source locations, and halo heights, halo CMEs are similar between SCs 24 and 25 but different from SC 23. This result follows from the fact that weaker cycles have low heliospheric total pressure, whose backreaction on CMEs allows them to expand more and hence enhancing the chance of becoming a halo. The solar cycle variation of halo CME properties is consistent with the precursor-based cycle prediction methods that indicate SC 25 is similar to or only slightly stronger than SC 24.</description>

      <title>Anticipating Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares commonly have a hot onset precursor event" (HOPE), detectable from soft X-ray observations. Detecting this requires subtraction of pre-flare fluxes from the non-flaring Sun prior to the event, fitting an isothermal emission model to the flare excess fluxes by comparing the GOES passbands at 1-8 A and 0.5-4 A, and plotting the timewise evolution of the flare emission in a diagram of temperature \textit{vs} emission measure. The HOPE then appears as an initial "horizontal branch" in this diagram. It precedes the non-thermal impulsive phase of the flare and thus the flare peak in soft X-rays as well. We use this property to define a "flare anticipation index" (FAI), which can serve as an alert for observational programs aimed at solar flares based on near-real-time soft X-ray observations. This FAI gives lead times of a few minutes and produces very few false positive alerts even for flare brightenings too weak to merit NOAA classification.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter and Mid-Infrared Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the M17SWex Intermediate-Mass Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability within the M17 Southwest Extension (M17 SWex), using 3.5 years of monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) and 9 years from the NEOWISE mission at mid-infrared (mid-IR). Our study encompasses observations of 147 bright sub-mm peaks identified within our deep JCMT co-added map as well as 156 YSOs in NEOWISE W1 and 179 in W2 that were previously identified in Spitzer surveys. We find three robust sub-mm variables: two are candidate YSOs and one is a likely extragalactic source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 47 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This is similar to what has previously been observed for low-mass YSO variability within the Gould Belt. However, we observe less overall variability in M17SWex at both the sub-mm and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower fraction is due to the greater distance to M17 SWex. Our findings showcase the utility of multi-wavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Dynamic Alignment in MHD Turbulence: Insights into Intermittency, Compressibility, and Imbalance Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale-Dependent Dynamic Alignment (SDDA) in Els\"asser field fluctuations is theorized to suppress nonlinearities and modulate the energy spectrum. Limited empirical evidence exists for SDDA within the solar wind turbulence's inertial range. We analyzed data from the WIND mission to assess the effects of compressibility, intermittency, and imbalance on SDDA. SDDA consistently appears at energy-containing scales, with a trend toward misalignment at inertial scales. Compressible fluctuations show no increased alignment; however, their impact on SDDA's overall behavior is minimal. The alignment angles inversely correlate with field gradient intensity, likely due to "anomalous" or "counterpropagating" wave packet interactions. This suggests that SDDA originates from mutual shearing of Els\"asser fields during imbalanced ($\delta \boldsymbol{z}^{\pm} \gg \delta \boldsymbol{z}^{\mp}$) interactions. Rigorous thresholding on field gradient intensity reveals SDDA signatures across much of the inertial range. The scaling of Els\"asser increments' alignment angle, $\Theta^{z}$, steepens with increasing global Alfv\'enic imbalance, while the angle between magnetic and velocity field increments, $\Theta^{ub}$, becomes shallower. $\Theta^{ub}$ only correlates with global Els\"asser imbalance, steepening as the imbalance increases. Furthermore, increasing alignment in $\Theta^{ub}$ persists deep into the inertial range of balanced intervals but collapses at large scales for imbalanced ones. Simplified theoretical analysis and modeling of high-frequency, low-amplitude noise in the velocity field indicate significant impacts on alignment angle measurements even at very low frequencies, with effects growing as global imbalance increases.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden Inside of Gaia Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered binaries containing single BHs and visible stars without mass transfer, so-called Gaia BHs. One important question is if Gaia BHs have binary BHs (BBHs), hereafter Gaia BBHs, instead of single BHs. We have investigated how efficiently Gaia BBHs are formed in open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of Gaia BHs, by means of gravitational $N$-body simulations. Limiting Gaia BHs' periods to $10^2$-$10^4$ days, we have found that there are no Gaia BBHs in the solar-metallicity environments, while the formation efficiency of Gaia BBHs is not small ($\sim 10^{-6} M_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ % of Gaia BHs) in subsolar-metallicity environments. However, the probability of Gaia BBHs hidden in Gaia BHs is only $\sim 1$ %. This is because most of the BBHs merge within $1$ Gyr through gravitational wave radiation. Note that the ages of discovered Gaia BHs are more than $1$ Gyr. If we extend Gaia BHs' periods to $10^4$-$10^5$ days, the probability becomes higher to $\sim 10$ %. In this case, a large fraction of BBHs can have enough wide orbits not to merge within the Hubble time. The probability would not be high for Gaia BHs already discovered and to be discovered in the near future. Nevertheless, we have shown the BH/BBH mass, visible star mass, and eccentricity distributions of Gaia BHs and Gaia BBHs, which will be helpful for follow-up observations to discover Gaia BBHs. A Gaia BH would be more likely to be a Gaia BBH if it has younger age, longer period, lower-mass companion, more circular orbit, lower metallicity, and more massive BH. Our results have implied that Gaia BH3 is unlikely to be a Gaia BBH.</description>

      <title>Stability of a realistic astrophysical pulsar and its mass-radius relation in higher-order curvature gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this research is to explore compact celestial objects while considering the framework of an extended gravitational theory known as $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. The notations $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ denote the Ricci scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, respectively. Radio pulsars, which are neutron stars with masses greater than 1.8 times that of the Sun ($M_\odot$), provide exceptional opportunities for delving into fundamental physics in extraordinary environments unparalleled in the observable universe and surpassing the capabilities of experiments conducted on Earth. Through the utilization of both the linear and quadratic expressions of the function { $f(\mathcal{G}) = \alpha_1 \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\alpha_1$ (with dimensional units of [${\textit length}^6$]) are incorporated}, we have achieved an accurate analytical solution for anisotropic perfect-fluid spheres in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. By integrating the dimensional parameters $\alpha_1$ and the compactness factor, defined as ${\mathcal C=\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}$, we showcase our capacity to encompass and depict all physical characteristics within the stellar structure. We illustrate that the model is capable of producing a stable arrangement encompassing its physical and geometric properties. We illustrate that by utilizing the quadratic form of $\mathcal{G}$ in the $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ framework, the ansatz of Krori-Barua establishes connection between pressure in the radial direction ($p_r$) using semi-analytical methods, pressure in the tangential direction ($p_t$), and density ($\rho$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type IIb supernovae are important subclass of stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe), which show H lines only at early times. Their progenitors are believed to contain a low-mass H envelope before explosion. This work reports the discovery of a progenitor candidate in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images for the Type IIb SN~2017gkk. With detailed analysis of its spectral energy distribution and local environment, we suggest that the progenitor is most likely a yellow supergiant with significant circumstellar extinction and has an initial mass of about 16 $M_\odot$, effective temperature log($T_{\rm eff}/K)=3.72\pm0.08$ and luminosity log($L/L_{\odot})=5.17\pm0.04$. This progenitor is not massive enough to strip envelope through stellar wind, and it supports an interacting binary progenitor channel and adds to the growing list of direct progenitor detections for Type~IIb SNe. Future late-time observations will confirm whether this progenitor candidate has disappeared and reveal the putative binary companion that has survived the explosion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter in the Universe is still an open question in astrophysics and cosmology. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) offer a compelling solution, and traditionally ground-based experiments have eagerly, but to date unsuccessfully, searched for these hypothetical low-mass particles that are expected to be produced in large quantities in the strong electromagnetic fields in the interior of stars. This work offers a fresh look at axions and ALPs by leveraging their conversion into X-rays in the magnetic field of the Sun's atmosphere rather than a laboratory magnetic field. Unique data acquired with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) during the solar minimum in 2020 allows us to set stringent limits on the coupling of axions to photons using state-of-the-art magnetic field models of the solar atmosphere. We report pioneering limits on the axion-photon coupling strength of $6.9\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 2\times 10^{-7}$ eV, surpassing current ground-based searches and further probing unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to axion masses of $m_a \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Formation of neutron stars inside planetary nebulae via accretion-induced collapse and core-merger-induced collapse from white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First, I demonstrate the possible formation channel for neutron stars (NSs) via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) composition white dwarfs (WDs) inside planetary nebulae (PNe; also so-called symbiotic nebulae). A heavy mass loss via the stellar wind or during the the roche-lobe overfilling (RLOF) mass-transfer may happen at the late evolutionary phase of ONeMg WD - red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, and it might form nebulae with central accreting WD binaries. The nebulae might be ionized the hot cores of giant stars or accreting WDs. Therefore, the accreting WD inside the symbiotic nebulae might grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit mass and collapse. Peculiar NSs born via the AIC of WDs inside the symbiotic nebulae (PNe) may finally have WD companions and become the NS-WD systems, and the Milky Way may contain tens of such kind of systems. Second, I introduce another possibility for the formation of PNe (or pulsar wind nebulae) with newborn NS via the core-merger-induced collapse during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries.</description>

Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It is approved for a Phase B study. In this work, we report on the accurate simulation of the detector's response to evaluate the scientific performance. A GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the physical interactions of the source photons with the detector and the passive materials. Using this approach, we implemented a detailed CUSP Mass Model. In this work, we report on the evaluation of the detector's effective area as a function of the beam energy.</description>

Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project aims to develop a constellation of two CubeSats orbiting the Earth to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter on board of each satellite. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures. CUSP is a project approved for a Phase B study by the Italian Space Agency in the framework of the Alcor program aimed to develop CubeSat technologies and missions. In this paper we describe the a method for a multi-physical simulation analysis while analyzing some possible design optimization of the payload design solutions adopted. In particular, we report the mechanical design for each structural component, the results of static and dynamic finite element analysis, the preliminary thermo-mechanical analysis for two specific thermal cases (hot and cold orbit) and a topological optimization of the interface between the platform and the payload.</description>

      <title>Characterization of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission</title>

Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow the study of the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. It is approved for a Phase B study. In this work, we report on the characterization of the Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) that will be used as readout sensors of the absorption stage of the Compton polarimeter. We assessed the APDs gain and energy resolution as a function of temperature by irradiating the sensor with a \textsuperscript{55}Fe radioactive source. Moreover, the APDs were also characterized as being coupled to a GAGG scintillator.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Binary Planets within Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. We find that critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9\% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 = 10$--20~au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$~Myr~pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.</description>

      <title>MIRI MRS Observations of Beta Pictoris II. The Spectroscopic Case for a Recent Giant Collision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling observations of the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic, obtained in 2023 January with the MIRI MRS on board JWST, reveals significant differences compared with that obtained with the IRS on board Spitzer. The bright 5 - 15 $\mu$m continuum excess modeled using a $\sim$600 K black body has disappeared. The previously prominent 18 and 23 $\mu$m crystalline forsterite emission features, arising from cold dust ($\sim$100 K) in the Rayleigh limit, have disappeared and been replaced by very weak features arising from the hotter 500 K dust population. Finally, the shape of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature has changed, consistent with a shift in the temperature of the warm dust population from $\sim$300 K to $\sim$500 K and an increase in the crystalline fraction of the warm, silicate dust. Stellar radiation pressure may have blown both the hot and the cold crystalline dust particles observed in the Spitzer spectra out of the planetary system during the intervening 20 years between the Spitzer and JWST observations. These results indicate that the $\beta$ Pic system has a dynamic circumstellar environment, and that periods of enhanced collisions can create large clouds of dust that sweep through the planetary system.</description>

      <title>The TROY project III. Exploring co-orbitals around low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-orbital objects, also known as trojans, are frequently found in simulations of planetary system formation. In these configurations, a planet shares its orbit with other massive bodies. It is still unclear why there have not been any co-orbitals discovered thus far in exoplanetary systems or even pairs of planets found in such a 1:1 mean motion resonance. Reconciling observations and theory is an open subject in the field. The main objective of the TROY project is to conduct an exhaustive search for exotrojans using diverse observational techniques. In this work, we analyze the radial velocity time series informed by transits, focusing the search around low-mass stars. We employed the alpha-test method on confirmed planets searching for shifts between spectral and photometric mid-transit times. This technique is sensitive to mass imbalances within the planetary orbit, allowing us to identify non-negligible co-orbital masses. Among the 95 transiting planets examined, we find one robust exotrojan candidate with a significant 3-sigma detection. Additionally, 25 exoplanets show compatibility with the presence of exotrojan companions at a 1-sigma level, requiring further observations to better constrain their presence. For two of those weak candidates, we find dimmings in their light curves within the predicted Lagrangian region. We established upper limits on the co-orbital masses for either the candidates and null detections. Our analysis reveals that current high-resolution spectrographs effectively rule out co-orbitals more massive than Saturn around low-mass stars. This work points out to dozens of targets that have the potential to better constraint their exotrojan upper mass limit with dedicated radial velocity observations. We also explored the potential of observing the secondary eclipses of the confirmed exoplanets to enhance the exotrojan search.</description>

      <title>Properties of self-excited pulsations in 3D simulations of AGB stars and red supergiants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristic variability of cool giants and supergiants is attributed to a combination of stellar pulsation and large-scale convective flows. Full 3D radiation-hydrodynamical modelling is an essential tool for understanding the nature of these dynamical processes. The parameter space in our 3D model grid of red giants has expanded in recent years. These models can provide many insights on the nature and properties of the pulsations, including the interplay between convection and pulsations. We treat 3D dynamical models of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants similar to observational data. We aim to explore the relation between stellar parameters and the properties of the self-excited pulsations. Output from global 'star-in-a-box' models computed with the CO5BOLD radiation-hydrodynamics code were analysed, particularly in regards to the pulsation properties, to find possible correlations with input and emergent stellar parameters. The fast Fourier transform was applied to spherically averaged mass flows to identify possible radial pulsation periods beneath the photosphere of the modelled stars. Stellar parameters were investigated for correlations with the extracted pulsation periods. We find that the pulsation periods varied with the stellar parameters in good agreement with the current expectations. The pulsation periods follow Ritter's period-mean density relation well and our AGB models agree with period-luminosity relations derived from observations. A mass estimate formula was derived from the 3D models, relating the stellar mass to the fundamental mode pulsation period and the stellar radius. While the non-linearity of the interplay between the self-excited pulsations and the self-consistent convection complicates analyses, the resulting correlations are in good agreement with respect to current theoretical and observational understandings.</description>

      <title>Formation of millisecond pulsars with wide orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are a kind of radio pulsars with short spin periods, playing a key role in many aspects of stellar astrophysics. In recent years, some more MSPs with wide orbits ($&gt;30\,\rm d$) have been discovered, but their origin is still highly unclear. In the present work, according to an adiabatic power-law assumption for the mass-transfer process, we carried out a large number of complete binary evolution computations for the formation of MSPs with wide orbits through the iron core-collapse supernova (CCSN) channel, in which a neutron star (NS) originating from a CCSN accretes matter from a red-giant (RG) star and spun up to millisecond periods. We found that this channel can form the observed MSPs with wide orbits in the range of $30-1200\,{\rm d}$, in which the WD companions have masses in the range of $0.28-0.55\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We also found that almost all the observed MSPs can be reproduced by this channel in the WD companion mass versus orbital period diagram. We estimate that the Galactic numbers of the resulting MSPs from the CCSN channel are in the range of $\sim 4.8-8.5\times10^{5}$. Compared with the accretion-induced collapse channel, the CCSN channel provides a main way to produce MSPs with wide orbits.</description>

      <title>The Brown Dwarf Kinematics Project (BDKP). VI. Ultracool Dwarf Radial and Rotational Velocities from SDSS/APOGEE High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: We present precise measurements of radial (RV) and projected rotational ($v\sin{i}$) velocities, effective temperatures, and surface gravities of a sample of 258 M6 to L2 dwarfs with multi-epoch, high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 22500), near-infrared (1.514-1.696 $\mu$m) spectroscopic observations reported in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17. The spectra were modeled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling method which achieved median precisions of $\sigma_\text{RV}$ = 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{v\sin{i}}$ = 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. One-half of our sample (138 sources) are previously known members of nearby young clusters and moving groups, and we identified three new kinematic members of the Argus or Carina Near moving groups, 2MASS J05402570+2448090, 2MASS J14093200+4138080, and 2MASS J21272531+5553150. Excluding these sources, we find that the majority of our sample has kinematics consistent with the Galactic thin disk, and eleven sources are associated with the intermediate thin/thick disk. The field sample has a velocity dispersion of 38.2$\pm$0.3 km s$^{-1}$, equivalent to an age of 3.30$\pm$0.19 Gyr based on empirical age-velocity dispersion relations; and a median $v\sin{i}$ of 17 km s$^{-1}$. For 172 sources with multi-epoch observations, we identified 37 as having significant radial velocity variations, and determined preliminary orbit parameters for 26 sources with four or more epochs. For 40 sources with photometric variability periods from the literature less than 5 days and $v\sin{i}$ $&gt;$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, we find a decline in projected radii $R\sin{i}$ with age congruent with evolutionary models. Finally, we also present multi-epoch RV and vsini measurements for additional 444 candidate ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the high-resolution spectroscopy of AW UMa and Epsilon CrA: Is the Lucy model valid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A re-examination of high-resolution spectral monitoring of the W UMa-type binaries AW UMa and Epsilon CrA casts doubt on the widely utilized Lucy (1968a, 1968b) model of contact binaries. The detection of the very faint profile of the secondary component in AW UMa leads to a new spectroscopic determination of the mass ratio, q(sp) = 0.092 +/- 0.007, which is close to the previous, medium-resolution spectroscopic result of Pribulla &amp; Rucinski (2008), q(sp) = 0.101 +/- 0.006, and remains substantially different from a cluster of generally accepted photometric results by several authors, concentrated around q(ph) = 0.080 +/- 0.005. The two approaches are independent, with the spectroscopic technique being more direct yet more demanding on telescope/spectrograph resources, while the photometric determinations are accessible to smaller telescopes but entirely dependent on the Lucy model. A survey of binaries with the best-determined values of the mass ratio shows a common tendency for q(ph) &lt; q(sp). The tendency for systematically smaller values of q(ph) may result from the overfilling of the primary lobe and underfilling of the secondary lobe relative to the Roche model geometry, as predicted by the Stepien (2009) model; the tendency may be variable in time. Despite the observed moderate inter-systemic velocities, the photometric Lucy model may remain useful in providing approximate, though biased, results for the mass ratio. A complicating factor in detailed spectral analysis may be the occurrence of Enhanced Spectral-line Perturbations (ESP) projected over the secondary profiles, appearing in different numbers in the two studied binaries. The ESPs are tentatively identified within the Stepien model as collision fronts or fountains of hot, primary-component gas from the circumbinary, energy-carrying flow.</description>

      <title>The DBL Survey I: discovery of 34 double-lined double white dwarf binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first discoveries of the double-lined double white dwarf (DBL) survey that targets over-luminous sources with respect to the canonical white dwarf cooling sequence according to a set of well-defined criteria. The primary goal of the DBL survey is to identify compact double white dwarf binary star systems from a unique spectral detection of both stars, which then enables a precise quantification of the atmospheric parameters and radial velocity variability of a system. Our search of 117 candidates that were randomly selected from a magnitude limited sample of 399 yielded a 29% detection efficiency with 34 systems exhibiting a double-lined signature. A further 38 systems show strong evidence of being single-lined or potentially-double-lined double white dwarf binaries and 7 single-lined sources from the full observed sample are radial velocity variable. The 45 remaining candidates appear as a single WD with no companion or a non-DA white dwarf, bringing the efficiency of detecting binaries to 62%. Atmospheric fitting of all double-lined systems reveals a large fraction that have two similar mass components that combine to a total mass of 1.0-1.3 solar masses - a class of double white dwarf binaries that may undergo a sub-Chandrasekhar mass type Ia detonation or merge to form a massive O/Ne WD, although orbital periods are required to infer on which timescales. One double-lined system located 49pc away, WDJ181058.67+311940.94, is super-Chandrasekhar mass, making it the second such double white dwarf binary to be discovered.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems II: A 1 to 20 Micron Spectrum of the Planetary-Mass Companion VHS 1256-1257 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the highest fidelity spectrum to date of a planetary-mass object. VHS 1256 b is a $&lt;$20 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ widely separated ($\sim$8\arcsec, a = 150 au), young, planetary-mass companion that shares photometric colors and spectroscopic features with the directly imaged exoplanets HR 8799 c, d, and e. As an L-to-T transition object, VHS 1256 b exists along the region of the color-magnitude diagram where substellar atmospheres transition from cloudy to clear. We observed VHS 1256~b with \textit{JWST}'s NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS modes for coverage from 1 $\mu$m to 20 $\mu$m at resolutions of $\sim$1,000 - 3,700. Water, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sodium, and potassium are observed in several portions of the \textit{JWST} spectrum based on comparisons from template brown dwarf spectra, molecular opacities, and atmospheric models. The spectral shape of VHS 1256 b is influenced by disequilibrium chemistry and clouds. We directly detect silicate clouds, the first such detection reported for a planetary-mass companion.</description>
