      <title>inrep: A Comprehensive Framework for Adaptive Testing in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inrep package provides a comprehensive framework for implementing computerized adaptive testing (CAT) in R. Building upon established psychometric foundations from TAM, the package enables researchers to deploy production-ready adaptive assessments through an integrated shiny interface. The framework supports all major item response theory models (1PL, 2PL, 3PL, GRM) with real-time ability estimation, multiple item selection algorithms, and sophisticated stopping criteria. Key innovations include dual estimation engines for optimal speed-accuracy balance, comprehensive multilingual support, GDPR-compliant data management, and seamless integration with external platforms. Empirical validation demonstrates measurement accuracy within established benchmarks while reducing test length efficiently. The package addresses critical barriers to CAT adoption by providing a complete solution from study configuration through deployment and analysis, making adaptive testing accessible to researchers across educational, psychological, and clinical domains.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Average Hazard as Harmonic Mean" by Chiba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article published in Pharmaceutical Statistics, Chiba proposed a reinterpretation of the average hazard as a harmonic mean of the hazard function and questioned the validity of the Kaplan-Meier plug-in estimator when the truncation time does not coincide with an observed event time. In this commentary, we examine the arguments presented and highlight several points that warrant clarification. Through simulation studies, we further show that the plug-in estimator provides reliable estimates across a range of truncation times, even in small samples. These support the continued utilization of the Kaplan-Meier plug-in estimator for the average hazard and help clarify its proper interpretation and implementation.</description>

      <title>Estimating the variance-covariance matrix of two-step estimates of latent variable models: A general simulation-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general procedure for estimating the variance-covariance matrix of two-step estimates of structural parameters in latent variable models. The method is partially simulation-based, in that it includes drawing simulated values of the measurement parameters of the model from their sampling distribution obtained from the first step of two-step estimation, and using them to quantify part of the variability in the parameter estimates from the second step. This is asymptotically equal with the standard closed-form estimate of the variance-covariance matrix, but it avoids the need to evaluate a cross-derivative matrix which is the most inconvenient element of the standard estimate. The method can be applied to any types of latent variable models. We present it in more detail in the context of two common models where the measurement items are categorical: latent class models with categorical latent variables and latent trait models with continuous latent variables. The good performance of the proposed procedure is demonstrated with simulation studies and illustrated with two applied examples.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian Inference for Discretely Observed Continuous Time Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) becomes challenging when the process is only observed at discrete time points. The exact likelihood is intractable, and existing methods often struggle even in medium-dimensional state-spaces. We propose a scalable Bayesian framework for CTMC inference based on a pseudo-likelihood that bypasses the need for the full intractable likelihood. Our approach jointly estimates the probability transition matrix and a biorthogonal spectral decomposition of the generator, enabling an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure that obeys embeddability. Existing methods typically integrate out the unobserved transitions, which becomes computationally burdensome as the number of data or dimensions increase. The computational cost of our method is near-invariant in the number of data and scales well to medium-high dimensions. We justify our pseudo-likelihood approach by establishing theoretical guarantees, including a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the probability transition matrix and posterior consistency for the spectral parameters of the generator. Through simulation and applications, we showcase the flexibility and robustness of our approach, offering a tractable and scalable approach to Bayesian inference for CTMCs.</description>
