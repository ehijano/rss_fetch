      <title>Numerical fractional instantons in SU(2): center vortices, monopoles, and a sharp transition between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a numerical cooling algorithm to study fractional instantons in $SU(2)$ pure Yang-Mills on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$, $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$. We confirm that the fractional instantons are center vortices on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$ and monopoles on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and we calculate several properties relevant to using these solutions for semiclassical calculations. On $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$, we interpolate between the large $\mathbb{T}^2_*$ limit and the large $S^1$ limit to study how the solutions interpolate between center vortices and monopoles. We find that they are separated by a sharp transition, with 't Hooft's constant field strength solutions living at the transition point. These results contrast but do not contradict recent results suggesting continuity between vortices and monopoles.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant renormalization of four-quark operators in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalization of four-quark operators in one-loop perturbation theory. We employ a coordinate-space Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS), which can be advantageous compared to other schemes, especially in nonperturbative lattice investigations. From our perturbative calculations, we extract the conversion factors between GIRS and the modified Minimal Subtraction scheme ($\overline{\rm MS}$) at the next-to-leading order. A formidable issue in the study of the four-quark operators is that operators with different Dirac matrices mix among themselves upon renormalization. We focus on both parity-conserving and parity-violating four-quark operators, which change flavor numbers by two units ($\Delta F = 2$). The extraction of the conversion factors entails the calculation of two-point Green's functions involving products of two four-quark operators, as well as three-point Green's functions with one four-quark and two bilinear operators. The significance of our results lies in their potential to refine our understanding of QCD phenomena, offering insights into the precision of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements and shedding light on the nonperturbative treatment of complex mixing patterns associated with four-quark operators.</description>

      <title>Chiral Separation Effect from Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the chiral separation effect (CSE) in QCD by using the gauge/gravity duality. In QCD, this effect arises from a combination of chiral anomalies and the axial $U(1)$ anomaly. Due to the axial gluon anomaly, the value of the CSE conductivity is not determined by the anomalies of QCD but receives radiative corrections, which leads to nontrivial dependence on temperature and density. To analyze this dependence, we use different variants of V-QCD, a complex holographic model, carefully fitted to QCD data. We find our results for the anomalous CSE conductivity at small chemical potential and nonzero temperature to be in good qualitative agreement with recent results from lattice QCD simulations. We furthermore give predictions for the behavior of the conductivity at finite (vectorial and axial) chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Python4Physics: A physics outreach program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a summer outreach program developed to cultivate interest in physics in particular and physical sciences more broadly among high school and early college students using small projects in the Python programming language. We discuss the lessons we learned in the hopes that they will be valuable to other physicists in planning their own outreach efforts. We also provide links to resources and materials from the Python4Physics program, which we hope might be useful in other outreach programs.</description>

      <title>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that in general the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Towards determining the (2+1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics running coupling with Monte Carlo and quantum computing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions and present a strategy for studying the running coupling and extracting the non-perturbative $\Lambda$-parameter. To this end, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and quantum computing, where the former can be used to determine the numerical value of the lattice spacing $a$, and the latter allows for reaching the perturbative regime at very small values of the bare coupling and, correspondingly, small values of $a$. The methodology involves a series of sequential steps (i.e., the step scaling function) to bridge results from small lattice spacings to non-perturbative large-scale lattice calculations. Focusing on the pure gauge case, we demonstrate that these quantum circuits, adapted to gauge degrees of freedom, are able to capture the relevant physics by studying the expectation value of the plaquette operator, for matching with corresponding Monte Carlo simulations. We also present results for the static potential and static force, which can be related to the renormalized coupling. The procedure outlined in this work can be extended to Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter fields and might provide a way towards studying lattice quantum chromodynamics utilizing both quantum and classical methods.</description>

      <title>Effects of strangeness on the chiral pseudocritical line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within a 2+1 flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio model, we calculate the curvature coefficients and check them against available lattice QCD estimations. With the observation that the flavor mixing due to the `t Hooft determinant term significantly affects the $\kappa_{2}^{S}$, we explore the effect of $\mu_{S}$ on the $T-\mu_{B}$ crossover lines. With the novel determination of negative $\kappa_{2}^{B}$ at large $\mu_{S}$, we advocate the importance of studying the same in lattice QCD.</description>
