      <title>Heavy black hole seed survivors in dwarf galaxies: a case study of Leo I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $M_\bullet &gt; 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot$ hosted by high-redshift galaxies have challenged our understanding of black hole formation and growth, as several pathways have emerged attempting to explain their existence. The "heavy-seed" pathway eases the problem with the progenitors of these SMBHs having birth masses up to ${\sim} 10^5~{\rm M_\odot}$. Here, we investigate the possibility that a local dwarf galaxy, Leo I, harbors a heavy-seed descendant. Using Monte-Carlo merger trees to generate the merger histories of 1,000 dark matter halos similar to the Milky Way (MW; with a mass of ${\sim} 10^{12}~{\rm M_\odot}$ at redshift $z{=}0$). We search for Leo-like satellite halos among these merger trees, and investigate the probability that the progenitors of some of these satellites formed a heavy seed. We derive the likelihood of such "heavy seed survivors" (HSSs) across various formation and survival criteria as well as Leo-similarity criteria. We find that the virial temperature for the onset of atomic cooling and rapid gas infall that yields heavy seeds, $T_{\rm act}$, has the largest impact on the number of HSSs. We find HSSs in a fraction $0.7\%$, $18.1\%$, and $96.5\%$ of MW-like halos when $T_{\rm act}$ is set to $9,000$K, $7,000$K, and $5,000$K respectively. This suggests that Leo I could be hosting a heavy seed and could provide an opportunity to disentangle heavy seeds from other SMBH formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Sub-Gyr variability around the SFMS and its contribution to the scatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to measure the evolution of individual galaxies around the Star Formation Main Sequence (SFMS) during the last Gyr as a function of their stellar mass to quantify how much of its scatter is due to short-term variability.We derived star formation histories using full spectral fitting for a sample of 8,960 galaxies from the MaNGA survey to track the position of the galaxies in the SFMS during the last Gyr.The variability correlates with both the stellar mass of the galaxies and their current position in both the SFMS and the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), with the position in the latter strongly affecting variability in SFR. While most of the fluctuations are compatible with stochasticity, there is a very weak but statistically significant preference for $\sim135-150$ Myr time-scales. These results support a strong self-regulation of SFR within galaxies, establishing characteristic intensities and time-scales for bursts of star formation and quenching episodes. We also find that short-term variability cannot account for the entirety of the scatter in the SFMS. It appears to originate to a similar degree in short-term variability and long-term (halo-level) differentiation and fits predictions from models.</description>

      <title>The essential elements of dust evolution: a-C(:H) nanoparticle sub-structures and photo-fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous carbon materials, a-C(:H), are heterogeneous structures consisting of carbon atoms in different hybridisation states and bonding configurations and are thought to constitute a significant and observationally important fraction of the interstellar dust material. This work aims to characterise semi-conducting a-C(:H) nanoparticle structures and, in particular, their property-characterising aromatic domain size distribution and so predict how they will behave in intense UV radiation fields that can fragment them through dissociative and charge effects as a result of carbon-carbon bond-breaking. Using a statistical approach we determine the typical sizes of the aromatic domains, their size distribution, how they are network-bonded, and where they are to be found within the structure. We consider the effects of thermal excitation, photo-dissociation and charging of a-C(:H) nanoparticles, and the products of their fragmentation. The derived UV photon-induced fragmentation lifetimes for nanometre-sized a-C(:H) nanoparticles, with radii ~0.4-0.5nm radius and containing ~40-60 carbon atoms, are of the order of 10^6-10^7yr in the diffuse interstellar medium and likely 10^2-10^4 times shorter in photodissociation regions, depending on the local radiation field intensity. Grains larger than this are stable against photodissociation. In H{\footnotesize II} regions only a-C(:H) nanoparticles with radii greater than 0.7nm (&gt; 150 carbon atoms) are likely to survive. The photon-driven fragmentation of sub-nanometre a-C(:H) particles was determined to be important in the diffuse interstellar medium and also in high excitation regions, such as photodissociation and HII regions. However, in these same regions Coulomb fragmentation is unlikely to be an important dust destruction process.</description>

      <title>ALMA Sub-parsec Resolution Dense Molecular Line Observations of the NGC 1068 Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our ALMA observations of the dense molecular HCN J=4-3 and HCO$^{+}$ J=4-3 lines at $\lesssim$1 pc ($\lesssim$14 mas) resolution in the nuclear region of the nearby ($\sim$14 Mpc) well-studied AGN NGC 1068. Both emission lines are clearly detected around the AGN along an almost east-west direction, which we ascribe to the dusty molecular torus. The HCN J=4-3 emission is brighter than the HCO$^{+}$ J=4-3 emission in the compact ($\lesssim$3-5 pc) torus region. Apparent counter-rotation between the inner ($\lesssim$2 pc) and outer ($\gtrsim$2 pc) parts of the western torus, previously seen in $\sim$1.5 pc-resolution HCN J=3-2 and HCO$^{+}$ J=3-2 data, is also confirmed in our new $\lesssim$1 pc-resolution HCN J=4-3 and HCO$^{+}$ J=4-3 data. We apply a physically counter-rotating torus model, in which a compact dense gas clump collided with the western side of the existing rotating torus from the opposite direction, and we find that this model largely reproduces the observed properties of the combined new $\lesssim$1 pc-resolution HCN J=4-3 and HCO$^{+}$ J=4-3 data, and the previously obtained $\lesssim$1.5 pc-resolution HCN J=3-2 and HCO$^{+}$ J=3-2 data.</description>

      <title>Kinematic and extinction analysis of a potential spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the structure of the Milky Way is essential for understanding its morphology, dynamics, and evolution. However, studying its innermost regions is challenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red clump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes suggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new insights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight. We evaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction distributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and extinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening properties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated using N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the two RC features are kinematically distinct, with a relative proper motion difference of $-0.16\pm0.02\, mas/yr$ in the component parallel to the Galactic plane. This difference can be explained by Galactic rotation if the two RCs lie at different distances, consistent with the simulations. The extinction towards the secondary RC is also $\sim0.05$ mag higher than that of the primary RC. Additionally, we estimate that the extinction difference between the RC features corresponds to only $\sim5\%$ of the total extinction from Earth to the first RC, suggesting little interstellar material between the farthest edge of the Galactic bar and the kinematically distinct structure traced by the secondary RC. Using $JK_s$ photometry, we derive $A_J/A_{K_s}=3.34\pm0.07$, consistent with previous results and showing no significant variation across fields or along the line of sight. The results support the secondary clump tracing a distant structure, possibly a spiral arm, although we cannot exclude that the population belongs to the disc.</description>

      <title>Synthetic JWST galaxy images in the TNG50 simulation - I. Model validation and comparison to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the TNG50 cosmological simulation and three-dimensional radiative transfer post-processing to generate dust-aware synthetic observations of galaxies at $ 3 \leq z \leq 6 $ and $ \log_{10}(M_\ast/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \geq 8.5 $, tailored to match the depth and resolution of current deep JWST surveys (NGDEEP and JADES). We analyse the performance of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on the simulated sample, focusing on the recovery of photometric redshift and stellar mass. At $ z \leq 5 $, we find that 90 per cent of redshifts are recovered within $ \pm0.2 $, but performance declines at $ z = 6 $. Stellar masses are generally well-recovered within a factor of 2, but are systematically underestimated regardless of redshift, a trend that is more pronounced at the high-mass end $ ( \log_{10}(M_\ast/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \geq 10 ) $. In addition, we study the observer-frame colours of galaxies in this redshift range as well as the SED-inferred $UVJ$ diagram. We find that TNG50 galaxies broadly follow the tendencies marked by observations, but tend to be slightly redder at lower masses and bluer at higher masses, regardless of redshift. Finally, using a colour-based definition of quiescence, we determine the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass at $ 3 \leq z \leq 6 $, which we find to be broadly consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>JWST provides a new view of cosmic dawn: latest developments in studies of early galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the distant Universe are providing key insights into our understanding of the formation of galaxies. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has significantly enhanced our observational capabilities, leading to an expanded redshift frontier, providing unprecedented detail in the characterization of early galaxies and enabling the discovery of new populations of accreting black holes. This review aims to provide an introduction to the basic processes and components that shape the observed spectra of galaxies, with a focus on their relevance to techniques with which high-redshift galaxies are selected. The review further introduces specific topics that have attracted significant attention in recent literature, including the discovery of highly efficient galaxy formation in the early Universe, the relation between galaxies and the process of reionization, new insights into the formation of the first stars and the enrichment of interstellar gas with heavy elements, and breakthroughs in our understanding of the origins of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an X-ray Luminous Radio-Loud Quasar at $z=3.4$: A Possible Transitional Super-Eddington Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the multiwavelength properties of eFEDS J084222.9+001000 (hereafter ID830), a quasar at $z=3.4351$, identified as the most X-ray luminous radio-loud quasar in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field. ID830 shows a rest-frame 0.5-2 keV luminosity of $\log (L_\mathrm{0.5-2\,keV}/\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 46.20 \pm 0.12$, with a steep X-ray photon index ($\Gamma =2.43 \pm 0.21$), and a significant radio counterpart detected with VLA/FIRST 1.4 GHz and VLASS 3 GHz bands. The rest-frame UV to optical spectra from SDSS and Subaru/MOIRCS $J$-band show a dust reddened quasar feature with $A_\mathrm{V} = 0.39 \pm 0.08$ mag and the expected bolometric AGN luminosity from the dust-extinction-corrected UV luminosity reaches $L_\mathrm{bol,3000}= (7.62 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We estimate the black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH} = (4.40 \pm 0.72) \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ based on the MgII$\lambda$2800 emission line width, and an Eddington ratio from the dust-extinction-corrected UV continuum luminosity reaches $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd,UV}=1.44 \pm 0.24$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{Edd,X}} = 12.8 \pm 3.9$ from the X-ray luminosity, both indicating the super-Eddington accretion. ID830 shows a high ratio of UV-to-X-ray luminosities, $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.20 \pm 0.07$ (or $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.42 \pm 0.07$ after correcting for jet-linked X-ray excess), higher than quasars and little red dots in super-Eddington phase with similar UV luminosities, with $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}&lt;-1.8$. Such a high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ suggests the coexistence of a prominent radio jet and X-ray corona, in this high Eddington accretion phase. We propose that ID830 may be in a transitional phase after an accretion burst, evolving from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington state, which could naturally describe the high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$.</description>

      <title>A deep X-ray look to the most obscured quasar at z~3.6 and its environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most luminous and obscured quasars (QSOs) detected in infrared all-sky surveys could represent a key co-evolutionary phase from nuclear to circum-galactic (CG) scales in the formation of massive galaxies. In this context, Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) at z ~2-4 provide a unique opportunity to study the link between cosmic mass assembly and nuclear accretion in high-z luminous QSOs/galaxies. W0410-0913 (hereafter W0410-09) is a luminous ($\rm ~L_{\rm bol} \sim 6.4 \times10^{47} \rm erg\ s^{-1}$) obscured QSO at z = 3.631, with a 30 kpc CG Ly$\alpha$ nebula (CGLAN), smaller than the ~ 100 kpc nebulae around unobscured Type-I QSOs, and an exceptional overdense environment of ~ 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) within 300 kpc and $\pm$ 200 $\rm km ~s^{-1}$ of the Hot DOG. We aim to detect and characterize nuclear accretion in W0410-09 and its environment. Exploiting a deep proprietary ~280 ks Chandra observation, using empirical and physically motivated models for obscured sources, we show that W0410-09 exhibits Compton-thick obscuration ($\rm~ N_H &gt; 10^{24} \rm cm^{-2}$) and high intrinsic luminosity ($\rm ~L_{2-10} &gt; 10^{45} \rm erg ~s^{-1}$), making it one of the most luminous obscured QSOs at z $&gt;$ 3.5. With the exclusion of W0410-09 we do not detect X-ray emission from any of the 19 LAEs, except for a 3$\sigma$ signal in the 6-7 keV rest-frame band, interpreted as Fe K$\alpha$ emission, suggesting the presence of heavily obscured yet undetected AGN emission in several LAEs. Including W0410-09, the estimated AGN fraction is $f_{\rm AGN}^{\rm LAE} = 5^{+12}_{-4}$%, potentially up to ~35% if unresolved obscured AGN are considered as suggested by the Fe K$\alpha$ line detection. We conclude that W0410-09 is in a critical transitional blow-out phase, during which powerful QSO-driven outflows are clearing the nuclear obscuration, ultimately leading to an unobscured luminous quasar.</description>

      <title>Quokka-based understanding of outflows (QED) - IV. Limitations of H$\alpha$ as an outflow diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of broad wings in the H$\alpha$} line is commonly used as a diagnostic of the presence and properties of galactic winds from star-forming galaxies. However, the accuracy of this approach has not been subjected to extensive testing. In this paper, we use high-resolution simulations of galactic wind launching to calibrate the extent to which broad H$\alpha$} wings can be used to infer the properties of galactic outflows. For this purpose, we analyse a series of high-resolution wind simulations from the QED suite spanning two orders of magnitude in star formation surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$). We show that the broad component of H$\alpha$} emission correlates well with the wind mass flux at heights $\sim1$ kpc above the galactic plane, but that the correlation is poor at larger distances from the plane, and that even at 1 kpc the relationship between mass flux and surface brightness of broad H$\alpha$} is significantly sub-linear. The sub-linear scaling suggests that the electron column density in the wind increases systematically with outflow strength, and that the conventional assumption of constant electron density in the wind leads to a systematic overestimate of how steeply mass loading factors depend on $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$. We provide empirical scaling relations that observers can apply to correct for this effect when converting H$\alpha$} measurements to mass outflow rates. Finally, we use synthetic observations of the density-diagnostic $[\mathrm{S_{II}}]\,\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet to show that using this diagnostic only slightly improves estimates of wind outflow rates compared to the naive assumption of constant electron density, and performs significantly worse than the empirical correlation we provide.</description>

      <title>NGC 6860, Mrk 915, and MCG -01-24-012. II. Inflowing and outflowing cold molecular gas and the connection with ionized gas in Seyfert galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the cold molecular gas kinematics in the inner ~ 4-7 kpc (projected sizes) of three nearby Seyfert galaxies, with AGN luminosities of ~ 10$^{44}$ erg/s, using observations of the CO(2-1) emission line, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at ~ 0.5-0.8$^{\prime\prime}$ (~ 150-400 pc) spatial resolutions. After modeling the CO profiles with multiple Gaussian components, we detected regions with double-peak profiles that exhibit kinematics distinct from the dominant rotational motion. In NGC 6860, a molecular outflow surrounding the bipolar emission of the [O III] ionized gas is observed extending up to $R_{out}$ ~ 560 pc from the nucleus. There is evidence of molecular inflows along the stellar bar, although an alternative scenario, involving a decoupled rotation in a circumnuclear disk (CND) can also explain the observed kinematics. Mrk 915 shows double-peak CO profiles along one of its spiral arms. Due to its ambiguous disk orientation, part of the CO emission can be interpreted as a molecular gas inflow or an outflow reaching $R_{out}$ ~ 2.8 kpc. MCG -01-24-012 has double-peak profiles associated with a CND, perpendicular to the [O III] bipolar emission. The CO in the CND is rotating while outflowing within $R_{out}$ ~ 3 kpc, with the disturbances possibly being caused by the passage of the ionized gas outflow. Overall, the mass inflow rates are larger than the accretion rate needed to produce the observed luminosities, suggesting that only a fraction of the inflowing gas ends up feeding the central black holes. Although we found signatures of AGN feedback on the cold molecular phase, the mass outflow rates of ~ 0.09-3 M$_\odot$/yr indicate an overall weak impact at these AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, we may be witnessing the start of the depletion and ejection of the molecular gas reservoir that has accumulated over time.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved PAH_3.3 emission and stellar ages in ram pressure stripped clumps at z~0.3</title>

Abstract: Ram pressure stripping (RPS) plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3 micrometres PAH emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl = 0.306, tracing the effects of environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry, we perform spatially-resolved UV to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, characterising stellar populations in both galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detect PAH_3.3 mission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5 sigma, with morphologies revealing disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies, PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped tails up to a distance of 40 kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3 emission agree with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100 Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4 dex, but the relation appears to be age dependent. The spatial correlation between PAH strength, stellar age, and SFR - consistent across disks and tails - demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules can survive and be stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by the SED fitting provide the first observational evidence outside the Local Universe for the fireball model of star formation in stripped clumps. This work represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies, offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG 23 IR elemental abundances of 114 giant stars in 41 Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters have been extensively used as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution, as their constituent stars possess shared characteristics, including age, Galactocentric radius, metallicity, and chemical composition. By examining the trends of elemental abundances with metallicity, age, and Galactocentric radius, valuable insights can be gained into the distribution and nucleosynthetic origins of chemical elements across the Galactic disc. The infrared domain in particular facilitates the observation of some elemental abundances that can be challenging or impossible to discern in the optical, for example K and F. The objective of this study is to derive the stellar parameters and elemental abundances of up to 23 elements in 114 stars spanning 41 open clusters using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the present study aims to examine the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc. This is achieved by investigating radial abundance gradients, variations in abundance between clusters, and the dependence of chemical abundances on cluster age.</description>

      <title>The stellar mass function of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in 10 redshift bins at $0.2&lt;z&lt;5.5$ using the COSMOS2025 catalog built from $0.54 \, {\rm deg}^2$ JWST imaging from COSMOS-Web. Galaxies are selected by type using the $NUVrJ$ rest-frame color diagram and classified morphologically by bulge-to-total light ratio ($B/T$). The quiescent SMF shows rapid early build-up, with the most massive systems (${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})\gtrsim11$) assembled by $z\sim1$ and evolving little since. The star-forming SMF evolves more slowly, following a mass-evolution scenario where galaxies grow via star formation and quench at the characteristic mass $\log(M^{*}/{\rm M}_{\odot})\sim10.6$. Bulge systems ($B/T&gt;0.6$) dominate the quiescent SMF at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})&gt;10$ at all redshifts, while disks ($B/T&lt;0.2$) dominate at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})&lt;9$. However, most bulge-dominated galaxies are star-forming, with their fraction increasing with redshift and decreasing mass, consistent with being progenitors of quiescent bulges. We find evidence for environmental quenching onset at $z\sim3$ from the upturn in the quiescent SMF at ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})&lt;9.5$, contributed by disk-dominated galaxies consistent with satellite quenching that retains disk morphologies. Number densities of ${\rm log}(M_{\star}/{\rm M_{\odot}})&gt;10$ quiescent galaxies are lower than recent literature by $0.1-0.7$ dex, but agree well with simulations at $2&lt;z&lt;3$. At $z&gt;3$, simulations increasingly underpredict observations. Finally, we build an empirical model describing galaxy number density evolution by parametrizing quenching rates, baryon conversion efficiency, and bulge formation. Our model supports a scenario where star-forming galaxies grow central bulges before quenching in massive halos.</description>

      <title>Intensive X-ray/UVOIR continuum reverberation mapping of the Seyfert AGN MCG+08-11-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from intensive (x3 daily), three-month-long X-ray, UV and optical monitoring of the bright Seyfert active galactic nucleus (AGN) MCG+08-11-11 with Swift, supported by optical-infrared ground-based monitoring. The 12 resultant, well-sampled, lightcurves are highly correlated; in particular, the X-ray to UV correlation r_max = 0.85 is, as far as we know, the highest yet recorded in a Seyfert galaxy. The lags increase with wavelength, as expected from reprocessing of central high-energy emission by surrounding material. Our lag spectrum is much shallower than that obtained from an optical monitoring campaign conducted a year earlier when MCG+08-11-11 was approximately 4 times brighter. After filtering out long-term trends in the earlier optical lightcurves we recover shorter lags consistent with our own - demonstrating concurrent reverberation signals from different spatial scales and the luminosity dependence of the measured lags. We use our lag spectrum to test several physical models, finding that disc reprocessing models cannot account for the observed 'excess' lags in the u and r-i-bands that are highly indicative of the Balmer and Paschen continua produced by reprocessing in the broad line region (BLR) gas. The structure seen in both the variable (rms) and lag spectra, and the large time delay between X-ray and UV variations (approximately 2 days) all suggest that the BLR is the dominant reprocessor. The hard X-ray spectrum (Gamma approximately 1.7) and faint, red, UV-optical spectrum both indicate that the Eddington accretion ratio is low: approximately 0.03. The bolometric luminosity then requires that the black hole mass is substantially greater than current reverberation mapping derived estimates.</description>

      <title>Linking Warm Dark Matter to Merger Tree Histories via Deep Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos form hierarchically in the Universe through a series of merger events. Cosmological simulations can represent this series of mergers as a graph-like ``tree'' structure. Previous work has shown these merger trees are sensitive to cosmology simulation parameters, but as DM structures, the outstanding question of their sensitivity to DM models remains unanswered. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of deep learning methods trained on merger trees to infer Warm Dark Matter (WDM) particles masses from the DREAMS simulation suite. We organize the merger trees from 1,024 zoom-in simulations into graphs with nodes representing the merger history of galaxies and edges denoting hereditary links. We vary the complexity of the node features included in the graphs ranging from a single node feature up through an array of several galactic properties (e.g., halo mass, star formation rate, etc.). We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the WDM mass using the graph representation of the merger tree as input. We find that the GNN can predict the mass of the WDM particle ($R^2$ from 0.07 to 0.95), with success depending on the graph complexity and node features. We extend the same methods to supernovae and active galactic nuclei feedback parameters $A_\text{SN1}$, $A_\text{SN2}$, and $A_\text{AGN}$, successfully inferring the supernovae parameters. The GNN can even infer the WDM mass from merger tree histories without any node features, indicating that the structure of merger trees alone inherits information about the cosmological parameters of the simulations from which they form.</description>

      <title>Investigating the imprints of tidal features on simulated galaxy outskirts in LSST-like mock observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal features provide signatures of recent galaxy mergers, offering insights into the role of mergers in galaxy evolution. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will allow for an unprecedented study of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use mock images of galaxies at $z\sim0$ ($z\sim0.2$ for \textsc{NewHorizon}) from \textsc{NewHorizon}, \textsc{eagle}, \textsc{IllustrisTNG}, and \textsc{Magneticum Pathfinder} simulations to predict the properties of tidal features in LSST-like images. We find that tidal features are more prevalent around blue galaxies with intrinsic colours $(g-i)\leq0.5$, compared to redder ones, at fixed stellar mass. This trend correlates with elevated specific star formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}&gt;10^{-10}\mathrm{\:yr}^{-1}$), suggesting that merger-induced star formation contributes to the bluer colours. Tidal feature hosts in the red sequence appear to exhibit colour profiles offset to bluer colours for galaxies with stellar masses $10^{10}&lt;M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot&lt;10^{11}$, similarly blue cloud tidal feature host galaxies appear to have their colour profiles offset to bluer colours for $10^{9.5}&lt;M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot&lt;10^{10.5}$. However, the differences in colour profiles in either the red sequence or the blue cloud are not statistically robust and larger samples are needed to test if these differences are real. The predictions across the simulations are quantitatively distinct; therefore, LSST observations will allow us to further constrain the differences between different subgrid physics models.</description>

      <title>Dents in the Mirror: A Novel Probe of Dark Matter Substructure in Galaxy Clusters from the Astrometric Asymmetry of Lensed Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric perturbations of lensed arcs behind galaxy clusters have been recently suggested as promising probes of small-scale ($\lesssim10^9 M_{\odot}$) dark matter substructure. Populations of cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos, predicted in hierarchical structure formation theory, can break the symmetry of arcs near the critical curve, leading to positional shifts in the observed images. We present a novel statistical method to constrain the average subhalo mass fraction ($f_{\rm sub}$) in clusters that takes advantage of this induced positional asymmetry. Focusing on CDM, we extend a recent semi-analytic model of subhalo tidal evolution to accurately simulate realistic subhalos within a cluster-scale host. We simulate the asymmetry of lensed arcs from these subhalo populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Using mock data, we demonstrate that our method can reliably recover the simulated $f_{\rm sub}$ to within 68\% CI in 73\% of cases, regardless of the lens model, astrometric precision, and image morphology. We show that the constraining power of our method is optimized for larger samples of well observed arcs, ideal for recent JWST observations of cluster lenses. As a preliminary test, we apply our method to the MACSJ0416 Warhol arc and AS1063 System 1. For Warhol we constrain the upper limit on $\log f_{\rm sub} &lt; -3.40^{+1.06}_{-0.97}$, while for AS1063 System 1 we constrain $\log f_{\rm sub} = -2.36^{+0.56}_{-0.89}$ (both at 68\% CI), consistent with CDM predictions. We elaborate on our method's limitations and its future potential to place stringent constraints on dark matter properties in cluster environments.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGNs (NLAGNs) among the ~300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGNs at 2&lt;z&lt;9, on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified four new z&lt;2 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs), in addition to the eight previously reported z&gt;4.5 BLAGNs. We found that most of the high-z NLAGN were selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [Oiii] $\lambda$4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration levels of the sample of NLAGNs with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGNs heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies physical properties, as was further confirmed by spectral energy distribution fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are ~1.5dex below the ones sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGNs. Finally, we investigated the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGNs and of the sample of high-z BLAGNs. We found that all but four NLAGNs are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGNs. We did not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~1-2 dex from what was expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio (1.4GHz) stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection and left open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.</description>

      <title>The radio properties of the JWST-discovered AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the radio emission of JWST-selected Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) in the GOODS-N field. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144\,MHz, 1.5\,GHz, 3\,GHz, 5.5\,GHz, 10\,GHz), and we find that none of the {37} sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of ${\sim 0.15}\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $3\sigma$ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of $L_{5GHz}=2\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the mean redshift of the sample $z\sim 5.1$. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations, {to check whether these are consistent with the standard BLAGN spectral energy distribution}. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found {might suggest} that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. Indeed, the probability of having none of the BLAGN detected in none of the investigated radio images is expected to be on average very low ($P&lt;10^{-4}$). We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that $\sim$1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.</description>

      <title>Constraining the potential of the Milky Way using stellar streams and the Inverse Time Integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for constraining the potential of the Milky Way using stellar streams with a known progenitor. The method expresses the stream in angle-action coordinates and integrates the orbits of the stars backwards in time to obtain the stripping point positions of the stream stars relative to the cluster. In the potential that generated the stream, the stars return approximately to the cluster centre. In a different potential, they are redirected to different locations. The free parameters of the model are estimated by maximising the degree of clustering of the stripping point distribution. We test this method with the stellar stream of the globular cluster M68 (NGC 4590). We use an N-body code to simulate the stream and generate a realistic star sample using a model of the Gaia selection function. We also simulate the expected observational uncertainties, and estimate the heliocentric distances and radial velocities of the stream stars from the cluster orbit. Using this sample of stars, we recover the values of four free parameters characterising the potential of the disc and the dark halo to an accuracy of about 10 per cent of the correct values. We show that this accuracy is improved up to about 2 per cent using the expected end-of-mission Gaia data. In addition, we obtain a strong correlation between the mass of the disc and the dark halo axis ratio, which is explained by the fact that the stream flows close and parallel to the disc plane.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: Black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of little red dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe through its detection of bright, massive galaxies up to $z\gtrsim 10$ and its identification of peculiar sources called `little red dots' (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects could resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST during their assembly. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase following rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc and carve out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>A deep dive down the broad-line region: permitted OI, CaII and FeII emission in an AGN Little Red Dot at z=5.3</title>

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at $z = 5.3$ behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides strong evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the $\lambda1304$ bump (i.e., blend of OI$\lambda$1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OI$\lambda$1304/$\lambda8446$ photon ratio provides an independent measurement of dust attenuation in galaxies. In Bz5.3, this ratio is highly suppressed (0.1--0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation $A_V \sim 0.4$--$1.0$. We identify Ly$\beta$ fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OI$\lambda$8446 equivalent width and weak OI$\lambda$7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OI$\lambda$8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.</description>

      <title>Modelling the M68 stellar stream with realistic mass loss and frequency distributions in angle-action coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new method for simulating stellar streams generated by globular clusters using angle-action coordinates. This method reproduces the variable mass-loss and variable frequency of the stripped stars caused by the changing tidal forces acting on the cluster as it moves along an eccentric orbit. The model incorporates realistic distributions for the stripping angle and frequency of the stream stars both along and perpendicular to the stream. The stream is simulated by generating random samples of stripped stars and integrating them forward in time in angle-frequency space. Once the free parameters are calibrated, this method can be used to simulate the internal structure of stellar streams more quickly than N-body simulations, while achieving a similar level of accuracy. We use this model to study the surface density of the stellar stream produced by the globular cluster M68 (NGC 4590). We select $291$ stars from the Gaia-DR3 catalogue along the observable section that are likely to be members of the stream. We find that the width of the stream is too large to be explained by stars stripped from the cluster alone. We simulate the stream using the present method and include the Gaia selection function and observational errors, and the process of separating the stream stars from the foreground. By comparing these results with the observed data, we estimate the age of the stream, or equivalently the cluster accretion time, to be $3.04_{-0.29}^{+5.63}$ Gyr, and the mass-loss of the cluster to be $0.496 \pm 0.030$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ arm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-disk Collisions for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test \textbf{the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions} by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, we investigate the bright ring features and polarization structures in images of the Kerr-Sen black hole associated with Sgr A*, as illuminated by 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Our findings reveal that an increase in the dilaton parameter leads to a shrinking of the bright ring, accompanied by enhancements in both its width and brightness. As the disk thickness grows, the bright ring's diameter and width both decrease. The brightness enhancement induced by the disk thickness is less prominent than that driven by the dilaton parameter. Comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters, and find that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observer's inclination. Furthermore, we analyze the coefficient $\beta_2$ to probe the polarization structure of the black hole images, and reveal that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <title>Estimating Orbital Parameters of Direct Imaging Exoplanet Using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved. Compared to traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework, our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.</description>
