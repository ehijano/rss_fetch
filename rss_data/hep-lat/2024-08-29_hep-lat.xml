      <title>Infrared properties of the quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we determine the eight form factors of the transversely-projected quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics, in the context of Landau-gauge QCD with two degenerate light dynamical quarks. The study is based on the set of Schwinger-Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang-Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang-Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang-Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov-Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, stabilise the chromo-magnetic vortices and dynamically induce, as non-trivial topological features, chiral symmetry-breaking. The latter is due to the appearance of torsional degrees of freedom, to which four fermion interactions are related, and to the formation of fermion condensates, in which gluon strings get stabilised by non-trivial braiding.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present preliminary numerical evidence for the hypothesis that the Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory discretized on a lattice obeys the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). To do so we study three approximations: (a) a linear plaquette chain in a reduced Hilbert space limiting the electric field basis to $j=0,\frac{1}{2}$ , (b) a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with periodic or closed boundary condition and the same Hilbert space constraint, and (c) a chain of only three plaquettes but such a sufficiently large electric field Hilbert space ($j \leq \frac{7}{2})$ that convergence of all energy eigenvalues in the analyzed energy window is observed. While an unconstrained Hilbert space is required to reach the continuum limit of SU(2) gauge theory, numerical resource constraints do not permit us to realize this requirement for all values of the coupling constant and large lattices. In each of the three studied cases we check first for random matrix theory (RMT) behavior in the eigenenergy spectrum and then analyze the diagonal as well as the off-diagonal matrix elements between energy eigenstates for a few operators. Within current uncertainties all results for (a), (b) and (c) agree with ETH predictions. Furthermore, we find the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric energy operator exhibit RMT behavior in frequency windows that are small enough in (b) and (c). To unambiguously establish ETH behavior and determine for which class of operators it applies, an extension of our investigations is necessary.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of ($\mathbf{2+1}$)-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory on Plaquette Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy with the tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopy scheme for the lattice field theory by using the tensor renormalization group method combining with the transfer matrix formalism. By using the scheme, we cannot only compute the energy spectrum for the lattice theory but also determine quantum numbers of the energy eigenstates. Furthermore, the wave function of the corresponding eigenstate can also be computed. The first step of the scheme is to coarse grain the tensor network of a given lattice model by using the higher order tensor renormalization group, and then after making a matrix corresponding to a transfer matrix from the coarse-grained tensors, its eigenvalues are evaluated to extract the energy spectrum. Second, the quantum number of the eigenstates can be identified by a selection rule that requires to compute matrix elements of an associated insertion operator. The matrix elements can be represented by an impurity tensor network and computed by the coarse-graining scheme. Moreover, we can compute the wave function of the energy eigenstate by putting the impurity tensor at each point in space direction of the network. Additionally, the momentum of the eigenstate can also be identified by computing appropriate matrix elements represented by the tensor network. As a demonstration of the new scheme, we show the spectroscopy of the $(1+1)$d Ising model and compare it with exact results. We also present a scattering phase shift obtained from two-particle state energy using L\"uscher's formula.</description>

      <title>Calculation of SU($2$) string tension in the continuum limit by an effective theory of center vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an effective theory for an ensemble of center vortices, we observe the area law fall-off in the continuum limit for the SU($2$) gauge group in three-dimensional Euclidean space-time. The string tension is obtained in terms of the intrinsic properties of the vortices and the parameter describing their interactions. A good qualitative agreement between our results and the lattice ones is observed. In addition, we show that the repulsive force between the vortices increases with temperature. This behavior is expected due to the reduction of vortex configuration at higher temperatures, required for the deconfinement regime.</description>

      <title>First-principle quantum Monte-Carlo study of charge carrier mobility in organic molecular semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principle numerical study of charge transport in a realistic two-dimensional tight-binding model of organic molecular semiconductors. We use the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm to simulate the full quantum dynamics of phonons and either a single or multiple charge carriers without any tunable parameters. We introduce a number of algorithmic improvements, including efficient Metropolis updates for phonon fields based on analytic insights, which lead to negligible autocorrelation times and allow to reach sub-permille precisions at small computational cost of $O(1)$ CPU-hour. Our simulations produce charge mobility estimates that are in good agreement with experiment and that also justify the phenomenological Transient Localisation approach.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions of spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>
