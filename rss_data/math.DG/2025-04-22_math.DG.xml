      <title>On Surfaces in R^n via Gauss Map, Caustics, Duality and Pseudo Euclidean Geometry of Quadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We get new results (and rederive some know ones) on smooth surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by unifying several view points into a coherent general view. Namely, we show and use new relations of the evolute (caustic) with the curvature ellipse, the Gauss map and the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of the $3$-space of quadratic forms on $\mathbb{R}^2$. A key result (Th.3.3.1): for a surface $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the intersection of its caustic with the normal space $N_pM$ is the polar dual hypersurface (in $N_pM$) of the curvature ellipse at $p$. Moreover, all local objects $X$ (cf. the invariants and their relations) have a "paired" version $X^*$ (with ${X^*}^*=X$) -- this provides new results on the original objects.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Solutions of Yamabe-Type Equations on Products of Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Yamabe-type equations on the product of two spheres $(S^n \times S^n, G_\delta)$, where $G_\delta$ is a family of Riemannian metrics parametrized by $\delta &gt; 0$. Using bifurcation theory and isoparametric functions, we establish the existence of degenerate solutions that are invariant under the diagonal action of $O(n+1)$ and depend non-trivially on both factors. Our analysis relies on the properties of Gegenbauer polynomials and a careful application of local bifurcation techniques for simple eigenvalues. These results extend previous studies by demonstrating the emergence of solutions that do not solely depend on a single factor, thereby providing new insights into the structure of solutions for Yamabe-type problems on product manifolds.</description>

      <title>Convex capillary hypersurfaces of prescribed curvature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the prescribed $k$-th Weingarten curvature problem for convex capillary hypersurfaces in $\overline{\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+}$. This problem naturally extends the prescribed $k$-th Weingarten curvature problem for closed convex hypersurfaces, previously investigated by Guan-Guan in [19], to the capillary setting. We reformulate the problem as the solvability of a Hessian quotient equation with a Robin boundary condition on a spherical cap. Under a natural sufficient condition, we establish the existence of a strictly convex capillary hypersurface with the prescribed $k$-th Weingarten curvature. This also extends our recent work on the capillary Minkowski problem in [40].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the topological results of Lytchak-Nagano and Lytchak-Nagano-Stadler for CAT(0) spaces to the setting of Busemann spaces of nonpositive curvature, i.e., BNPC spaces. We give a characterization of locally BNPC topological manifolds in terms of their links and show that the singular set of a locally BNPC homology manifold is discrete. We also prove that any (globally) BNPC topological 4-manifold is homeomorphic to Euclidean space. Applications include a topological stability theorem for locally BNPC G-spaces. Our arguments also apply to spaces admitting convex geodesic bicombings.</description>

      <title>Singular Lagrangians in the Hitchin moduli space and conformal limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the moduli space of semistable $\text{SL}(r, \mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles, we show that there exists a sublocus of the upward flow through a polystable $\mathbb{C}^{*}$-fixed point, which is Lagrangian on its intersection with the stable locus. This intesesction is always non-empty in the case when the Higgs field of the fixed point vanishes, or when the automorphism group of its polystable representative is abelian. Under the same assumptions, we show that the conformal limit of a stable Higgs bundle lying on this locus exists.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of positively curved Steady gradient Ricci solitons on orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study gradient Ricci soitons on smooth orbifolds. We prove that the scalar curvature of a complete shrinking or steady gradient Ricci soliton on an orbifold is nonnegative. We also show that a complete $\kappa$-noncollapsed steady gradient Ricci soliton on a Riemannian orbifold with positive curvature operator, compact singularity and linear curvature decay must be a finite quotient of the Bryant soliton. Finally, we show that a complete steady gradient Ricci soliton on a Riemannian orbifold with positive sectional curvature must be a finite quotient of the Bryant soliton if it is asymptotically quotient cylindrical.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric harmonic oscillators on singular geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant localization expresses global invariants in terms of local invariants, and many of them appearing in equivariant index theory, (holomorphic) Morse theory, geometric quantization and supersymmetric localization can be characterized as renormalized supertraces over cohomology groups of Hilbert complexes associated to local model geometries. This paper extends such local invariants, introducing and studying twisted de Rham and Dolbeault complexes (including Witten deformed versions) on singular spaces equipped with generalized radial (K\"ahler Hamiltonian) Morse functions and singular metrics arising naturally in algebraic geometry and moduli problems.
  We use the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and nilpotency properties of these complexes to extend an ansatz of Cheeger for the eigensections of the associated Laplace/Schr\"odinger type operators, reducing the problem to the study of Sturm-Liouville operators and one dimensional Schr\"odinger operators corresponding to different choices of domains, including those with del-bar Neumann boundary conditions for Dolbeault complexes. We define renormalized Lefschetz numbers and Morse polynomials generalizing those established in the smooth and conic settings where they have been used to compute many invariants of interest in physics and mathematics. We study structures on links of topological cones with singular K\"ahler metrics, which we use to describe associated analytic invariants including local cohomology groups. The techniques and results collected here are broadly applicable in the study of global analysis on singular spaces, including proofs of localization theorems with numerous applications.</description>

      <title>The ladder of Finsler-type objects and their variational problems on spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of anisotropic $r$-contravariant $s$-covariant $\alpha$-homogeneous tensors on a manifold admits a functorial structure where vertical derivatives $\dot{\partial}$ and contractions $\imath_{\mathbb{C}}$ by the Liouville vector field $\mathbb{C}$ are operators which maintain $s+\alpha$ constant. In (semi-)Finsler geometry, this structure is transmitted faithfully to connection-type elements yielding the following ladder: geodesic sprays / nonlinear connections / anisotropic connections / linear (Finslerian) connections. However, it is more loosely transmitted to metric-type ones: Finslerian Lagrangians / Legendre transformations / anisotropic metrics. We will study this structure in depth and apply it to discuss the recent variational proposals (Einstein-Hilbert, Einstein-Palatini, Einstein-Cartan) for generalizing Einstein equations to the Finsler setting.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Splitting Theorem for the $N$-Bakry \'Emery Ricci tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14962v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the spectral generalization of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem to smooth metric measure space. We show that if a complete non-compact weighted Riemannian manifold $(M,g,e^{-f}\,dvolg)$ of dimension $n\ge 2$ has at least two ends where $f$ is smooth and bounded. If there is some $N\in (0,\infty)$ and $\gamma&lt;\left(\frac{1}{(n-1)\left(1 + \frac{n-1}{N}\right)} + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)^{-1}$ such that $$\lambda_1(\gamma \Delta_f+\operatorname{Ric}^N_f)\ge 0$$then $M$ splits isometrically as $\mathbb{R}\times X$ for some complete Riemannian manifold $X$ with $(\operatorname{Ric}_X)^N_f\ge 0$. The estimate can recover the spectral splitting result and its sharp constant $\frac{4}{n-1}$ in Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu and and Catino--Mari--Mastrolia--Roncoroni.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket on smooth infinite-dimensional manifolds $M$ is developed in two steps: For summable multivector fields whose pointwise dual are all differential form, and in an extended form for multivector fields which are sections of $L^{\bullet}_{\text{skew}}(T^*M,\mathbb R)$. We need to either assume that $C^{\infty}(M)$ separates points on $TM$, or consider sheaves of local sections.</description>

      <title>Neumann Data and Second Variation Formula of Renormalized Area for Conformally Compact Static Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the first and second variation formulas for the renormalized area for static Einstein spaces along a specific direction, demonstrating that the negativity of the Neumann data implies instability. Consequently, we obtain a rigidity result for the case when the conformal boundary is a warped product torus, which strengthens the result presented in \cite{GSW}.</description>

      <title>One Dimensional Asymptotic Plateau Problem in $n$-Dimensional Asymptotically Conical Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15058v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be an asymptotically conical Riemannian manifold having dimension $n\ge 2$, opening angle $\alpha \in (0,\pi/2) \setminus \{\arcsin \frac{1}{2k+1}\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and positive asymptotic rate. Under the assumption that the exponential map is proper at each point, we give a solution to the one dimensional asymptotic Plateau problem on $M$. Precisely, for any pair of antipodal points in the ideal boundary $\partial_\infty M = \mathbb S^{n-1}$, we prove the existence of a geodesic line with asymptotic prescribed boundaries and the Morse index $\le n-1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we classify sextic curves in the Fano $3$-fold $\bf \mathcal{V}_5$ (the smooth quintic del Pezzo $3$-fold) that admit rational Galois covers in the complex ${\mathbb P}^3$. We show that the moduli space of such sextic curves is of complex dimension $2$ through the invariants of the engaged Galois groups for the explicit constructions. This raises the intriguing question of understanding the moduli space of sextic curves in ${\mathcal V}_5$ through their Galois covers in ${\mathbb P}^3$.</description>

      <title>Siegel-Veech Measures of Convex Flat Cone Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Siegel gives the average number of lattice points in bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Motivated by this result, Veech introduced an analogue for translation surfaces, known as the Siegel-Veech formula, which describes the average number of saddle connections of bounded length on the moduli space of translation surfaces. However, no such formula is known for flat surfaces with cone angles that are irrational multiples of $\pi$.
  A convex flat cone sphere is a Riemann sphere equipped with a conformal flat metric with conical singularities, all of whose cone angles lie in the interval $(0, 2\pi)$. In this paper, we extend the Siegel-Veech formula to this setting. We define a generalized Siegel-Veech transform and prove that it belongs to $L^\infty$ on the moduli space. This leads to the definition of a Siegel-Veech measure on $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, obtained by integrating the Siegel-Veech transform over the moduli space. This measure can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Siegel-Veech formula. We show that it is absolutely continuous and piecewise real analytic.
  Finally, we study the asymptotic behavior of this measure on small intervals $(0,\varepsilon)$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, providing an analogue of Siegel-Veech constants for convex flat cone spheres.</description>

      <title>Stratification and Rectifiability of Harmonic Map Flows via Tangent Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stratification theory for suitable solutions of harmonic map flows based on the spatial symmetry of tangent measures. Generally, suitable solutions are a category of solutions that satisfy both the localized energy inequality and the monotonicity formula. Building on the modifications and adjustments of quantitative stratifications and Reifenberg-rectifiable theory by Naber and Valtorta, we confirm that each stratum in our model is rectifiable. We also establish an estimate for the Minkowski content of the singular set at each time slice, demonstrating that the singular set is rectifiable and that our results strengthen previous findings, which were limited to almost every time slice. Furthermore, under certain assumptions about the target manifolds that exclude specific tangent flows and measures, our analysis achieves substantial improvements in the regularity of suitable solutions for harmonic map flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that arc K-semistability is a very general property in flat families of polarised varieties, and prove a similar result for uniform arc K-stability. This can be used to produce the only current examples of smooth uniformly arc K-stable varieties which are not known to admit a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric. Our technique is to prove a general result stating that semistability of a pair in the sense of Paul is a Zariski open property, and to employ prior work with Reboulet relating arc K-semistability to semistability of an associated pair.</description>

      <title>Canonical connections on sub-Riemannian manifolds with constant symbol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.05366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a tool to address the equivalence problem in sub-Riemannian geometry, we introduce a canonical choice of grading and compatible affine connection, available on any sub-Riemannian manifold with constant symbol. We completely compute these structures for contact manifolds of constant symbol, including the cases where the connections of Tanaka-Webster-Tanno are not defined. We also give an original intrinsic grading on sub-Riemannian (2,3,5)-manifolds, and use this to present the first flatness theorem in this setting.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Isoperimetric Bubbles on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09102v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-bubble isoperimetric conjecture in $n$-dimensional Euclidean and spherical spaces from the 1990's asserts that standard bubbles uniquely minimize total perimeter among all $q-1$ bubbles enclosing prescribed volume, for any $q \leq n+2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^3$ was confirmed in 2000 by Hutchings-Morgan-Ritor\'e-Ros, and is nowadays fully resolved for all $n \geq 2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and triple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^2$ have also been resolved, but all other cases are in general open. We confirm the conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on $\mathbb{S}^n$ for all $q \leq \min(5,n+1)$, namely: the double-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 2$, the triple-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 3$ and the quadruple-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 4$. In fact, we show that for all $q \leq n+1$, a minimizing cluster necessarily has spherical interfaces, and after stereographic projection to $\mathbb{S}^n$, its cells are obtained as the Voronoi cells of $q$ affine-functions, or equivalently, as the intersection with $\mathbb{S}^n$ of convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Moreover, the cells (including the unbounded one) are necessarily connected and intersect a common hyperplane of symmetry, resolving a conjecture of Heppes. We also show for all $q \leq n+1$ that a minimizer with non-empty interfaces between all pairs of cells is necessarily a standard bubble. The proof makes crucial use of considering $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$ in tandem and of M\"obius geometry and conformal Killing fields; it does not rely on establishing a PDI for the isoperimetric profile as in the Gaussian setting, which seems out of reach in the present one.</description>

      <title>Harmonic projections in negative curvature II: large convex sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of harmonic maps is due to Benoist--Hulin: given a quasi-isometry $f:X\to Y$ between pinched Hadamard manifolds, there exists a unique harmonic map at a finite distance from $f$. Here we show existence of harmonic maps under a weaker condition on $f$, that we call non-collapsing -- we require that the following two conditions hold uniformly in $x\in X$: (1) average distance from $f(x)$ to $f(y)$ for $y$ on the sphere of radius $R$ centered at $x$ grows linearly with $R$ (2) the pre-image under $f$ of small cones with apex $f(x)$ have low harmonic measures on spheres centered at $x$. Using these ideas, we also continue the previous work of the author on existence of harmonic maps that are at a finite distance from projections to certain convex sets. We show this existence in a pinched negative curvature setting, when the convex set is large enough. For hyperbolic spaces, this includes the convex hulls of open sets in the sphere at infinity with sufficiently regular boundary.</description>

      <title>Holonomy of parabolic geometries near isolated higher-order fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Cartan geometries admitting automorphisms with isotropies satisfying a particular, loosely dynamical property on their model geometries, we demonstrate the existence of an open subset of the geometry with trivial holonomy. This property, which generalizes characteristics of isotropies corresponding to isolated higher-order fixed points in parabolic geometries that are known to require a nearby open subset to have vanishing curvature, only relies upon the behavior of the isotropy in the model geometry, and therefore applies regardless of initial curvature assumptions, such as regularity or normality. Along the way to proving our main results, we also derive a couple of results for working with holonomy, relating to limits of sequences of developments and the existence of antidevelopments, that are useful in their own right. To showcase the effectiveness of the techniques developed, we use them to completely characterize all almost c-projective and almost quaternionic structures that admit a nontrivial automorphism with a higher-order fixed point, as well as all nondegenerate partially integrable almost CR structures that admit a higher-order fixed point with non-null isotropy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a Riccati-type equation applicable to (sub-)static Einstein spaces and examine its various applications. Specifically, within the framework of conformally compactifiable manifolds, we prove a splitting theorem for the Riemannian universal covering. Furthermore, we demonstrate two distinct methods by which the Riccati equation can establish the connectivity of the conformal boundary under the static Einstein equation. Additionally, for compact static triples possessing positive scalar curvature, we establish the compactness of the universal covering.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Ooguri-Vafa symplectic form \`a la Atiyah-Bott</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke predicted that the hyperk\"ahler Ooguri-Vafa space $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ should provide a local model for Hitchin moduli spaces near the discriminant locus. To this end, Tulli identified $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ with a certain space of framed Higgs bundles with an irregular singularity. We extend this result by identifying the Ooguri-Vafa holomorphic symplectic form with a regularized version of the Atiyah-Bott form on the associated space of framed connections. We also prove the analogous statement for the corresponding semiflat forms. Finally, restricting to the Hitchin section, we identify a regularized version of Hitchin's $L^2$-metric with the Ooguri-Vafa metric.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the volume-preserving harmonic mean curvature flow in asymptotically Schwarzschild spaces. We demonstrate the long-time existence and exponential convergence of this flow with a coordinate sphere of large radius serving as the initial surface in the asymptotically flat end, which eventually converges to a constant harmonic mean curvature surface. We also establish that these surfaces form a foliation of the space outside a large ball. Finally, we utilize this foliation to define the center of mass, proving that it agrees with the center of mass defined by the ADM formulation of the initial data set.</description>

      <title>Connections on a principal Lie groupoid bundle and representations up to homotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Lie groupoid principal $\mbbX$ bundle is a surjective submersion $\pi\colon P\to M$ with an action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $P$ with certain additional conditions. This paper offers a suitable definition for the notion of a connection on such bundles. Although every Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X}$ has its associated Lie algebroid $A:=1^*\ker ds\to X_0$, it does not admit a natural action on its Lie algebroid. There is no natural action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $TP$ either. Choosing a connection $\mathbb{H}\subset TX_1$ on the Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X},$ and considering its induced action up to homotopy of $\mathbb{X}$ on graded vector bundle $TX_0\oplus A,$ we prove the existence of a short exact sequence of diffeological groupoids over the discrete category $M$ (with appropriate vector space structures on the fibres) for the $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M.$ We introduce a notion of connection on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M,$ and show that such a connection $\omega$ splits the sequence. Finally, we show that a connection pair $(\omega, \mathbb{H})$ on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M$ is isomorphic to any other connection pair.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Lie groupoid $G$, the differential forms on its nerve comprise a double complex. A natural question is if this statement extends to forms with values in a representation $V$ of $G$. In this paper, we research two types of covariant derivatives which commute with the simplicial differential, yielding two types of "curved" double complexes of forms with coefficients in $V$. The naive approach is to consider a linear connection $\nabla$ on $V$, in which case $d^\nabla$ commutes with the simplicial differential if and only if $\nabla$ satisfies a certain (restrictive) invariance condition. The heart of this paper focuses on another, more compelling approach: using a multiplicative Ehresmann connection for a bundle of ideals. In this case, we obtain a geometrically richer curved double complex, where the cochain map is given by the horizontal exterior covariant derivative $D$, which generalizes the well-known operator from the theory of principal bundles. Moreover, both differential operators $d^\nabla$ and $D$ are researched in the infinitesimal setting of Lie algebroids, as well as their relationship with the van Est map. We conclude by using the operator $D$ to study the curvature of an (infinitesimal) multiplicative Ehresmann connection.</description>

Abstract: We present a version of the Lorentzian splitting theorem under a weakened Ricci curvature condition. The proof makes use of basic properties of achronal limits [19], [20], together with the geometric maximum principle for $C^0$ spacelike hypersurfaces in [1]. Our version strengthens a related result in [29] in the globally hyperbolic setting by removing a certain boundedness condition on the Ricci curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03755v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the deformation theory of Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with canonical singularities has highlighted the key role played by the higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities, and especially by the so-called $k$-liminal singularities for $k\ge 1$. The goal of this paper is to show that certain aspects of this study extend naturally to the $0$-liminal case as well, i.e. to Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with Gorenstein log canonical, but not canonical, singularities. In particular, we show the existence of first order smoothings of $Y$ in the case of isolated $0$-liminal hypersurface singularities, and extend Namikawa's unobstructedness theorem for deformations of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds $Y$ with canonical singularities to the case where $Y$ has an isolated $0$-liminal lci singularity under suitable hypotheses. Finally, we describe an interesting series of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct $d$-dimensional polyhedral chains such that the distribution of tangent planes is close to a prescribed measure on the Grassmannian and the chains are either cycles (if the barycenter of the prescribed measure, considered as a measure on $\bigwedge^d \mathbb{R}^n$, is $0$) or their boundary is the boundary of a unit $d$-cube (if the barycenter of the prescribed measure is a simple $d$-vector). Such fillings were first proved to exist by Burago and Ivanov [Geom. funct. anal., 2004]; our work gives an explicit construction, which is also flexible to generalizations. For instance, in the case that the measure on the Grassmannian is supported on the set of positively oriented $d$-planes, we can construct fillings that are Lipschitz multigraphs. We apply this construction to prove the surprising fact that, for anisotropic integrands, polyconvexity is equivalent to quasiconvexity of the associated $Q$-integrands (that is, ellipticity for Lipschitz multigraphs) and to show that strict polyconvexity is necessary for the atomic condition to hold.</description>

      <title>Hermitian-symplectic and Kahler structures on degenerate twistor deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M, \Omega)$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian fibration $\pi: M \to B$, and $\eta$ a closed $(1,1)$-form on $B$. Then $\Omega+ \pi^* \eta$ is a holomorphically symplectic form on a complex manifold which is called the degenerate twistor deformation of $M$. We prove that degenerate twistor deformations of compact holomorphically symplectic K\"ahler manifolds are also K\"ahler. First, we prove that degenerate twistor deformations are Hermitian symplectic, that is, tamed by a symplectic form; this is shown using positive currents and an argument based on the Hahn--Banach theorem, originally due to Sullivan. Then we apply a version of Huybrechts's theorem showing that two non-separated points in the Teichm\"uller space of holomorphically symplectic manifolds correspond to bimeromorphic manifolds if they are Hermitian symplectic.</description>

      <title>Linking numbers and non-holomorphic Siegel modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generating series encoding linking numbers between geodesics in arithmetic hyperbolic $3$-folds. We show that the series converge to functions on genus $2$ Siegel space and that certain explicit modifications have the transformation properties of genus $2$ Siegel modular forms of weight $2$. This is done by carefully analyzing the integral of the Kudla--Millson theta series over a Seifert surface with geodesic boundary. As a corollary, we deduce a polynomial bound on the linking numbers.</description>

      <title>Book I of Euclid's Elements and application of areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We work through Book I of Euclid's Elements with our focus on application of areas (I.42, I.44, I.45). We summarize alternate constructions from medieval editions of Euclid's elements and ancient and medieval commentaries. We remark that Euclid's proof of I.44 involves a seldom commented on use of superposition, but that several medieval editions of Euclid give constructions that avoid the use of superposition. This use of superposition is also avoided in Ralph Abraham's ``VCE: The Visual Constructions of Euclid'' C#12, C#12B at http://www.visual-euclid.org/vce/contents.html

      <title>A universal characteristic class for vector bundles with a connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper I introduce a new characteristic class $c(E)$ for a finite rank vector bundle $E$ on an affine scheme $S:=Spec(A)$ - the fundamental class of $E$. The class $c(E)$ is not a characteristic class in the classical sense in the sense that it lives in a pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$. Most characteristic classes lives in a cohomology group. The pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is a torsor on the abelian group $\operatorname{H}^2(L, Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E)))$ where $Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is the center of the ring of endomorphisms of $E$ and where the cohomology is the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the center. The class $c(E)$ is trivial if and only if $E$ has a flat algebraic connection. Hence the class $c(T_S)$ where $T_S$ is the tangent bundle, is an an obstruction for $S$ to be algebraically parallelizable. I use a connection $\nabla$ to define $c(E)$ and I also prove the class $c(E)$ is independent of choice of connection, hence $c(E)$ is an invariant of the vector bundle $E$. The class generalize the Chern class, the Pontryagin class, the Euler class and the Teleman characteristic class. I prove using an explicit example that the class $c(E)$ is stronger than the Chern class and the Euler class. I also give a new proof of a formula for the curvature of a connection $\nabla$ in terms of an idempotent endomorphism $\phi$ defining $E$. This formula was claimed and proved in a paper put out on the arXiv in 2011, and in this paper I give a new proof that is easier to read. The class may be interesting in the study of the "cancellation problem" in affine algebraic geometry and the problem of giving algebraic formulas for the topological Euler characteristic. I also calculate the algebraic deRham cohomology of the complex two sphere and prove it is infinite dimensional.</description>
