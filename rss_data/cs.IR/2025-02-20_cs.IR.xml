      <title>Range Retrieval with Graph-Based Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving points based on proximity in a high-dimensional vector space is a crucial step in information retrieval applications. The approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) problem, which identifies the $k$ nearest neighbors for a query (approximately, since exactly is hard), has been extensively studied in recent years. However, comparatively little attention has been paid to the related problem of finding all points within a given distance of a query, the range retrieval problem, despite its applications in areas such as duplicate detection, plagiarism checking, and facial recognition. In this paper, we present a set of algorithms for range retrieval on graph-based vector indices, which are known to achieve excellent performance on ANNS queries. Since a range query may have anywhere from no matching results to thousands of matching results in the database, we introduce a set of range retrieval algorithms based on modifications of the standard graph search that adapt to terminate quickly on queries in the former group, and to put more resources into finding results for the latter group. Due to the lack of existing benchmarks for range retrieval, we also undertake a comprehensive study of range characteristics of existing embedding datasets, and select a suitable range retrieval radius for eight existing datasets with up to 100 million points in addition to the one existing benchmark. We test our algorithms on these datasets, and find up to 100x improvement in query throughput over a naive baseline approach, with 5-10x improvement on average, and strong performance up to 100 million data points.</description>

      <title>HawkBench: Investigating Resilience of RAG Methods on Stratified Information-Seeking Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world information-seeking scenarios, users have dynamic and diverse needs, requiring RAG systems to demonstrate adaptable resilience. To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs.
  Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation.
  HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</description>

      <title>LLM4Tag: Automatic Tagging System for Information Retrieval via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tagging systems play an essential role in various information retrieval applications such as search engines and recommender systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in tagging systems due to their extensive world knowledge, semantic understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing methods still have limitations, including difficulties in retrieving relevant candidate tags comprehensively, challenges in adapting to emerging domain-specific knowledge, and the lack of reliable tag confidence quantification. To address these three limitations above, we propose an automatic tagging system LLM4Tag. First, a graph-based tag recall module is designed to effectively and comprehensively construct a small-scale highly relevant candidate tag set. Subsequently, a knowledge-enhanced tag generation module is employed to generate accurate tags with long-term and short-term knowledge injection. Finally, a tag confidence calibration module is introduced to generate reliable tag confidence scores. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets show that LLM4Tag significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and LLM4Tag has been deployed online for content tagging to serve hundreds of millions of users.</description>

      <title>Reproducing NevIR: Negation in Neural Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negation is a fundamental aspect of human communication, yet it remains a challenge for Language Models (LMs) in Information Retrieval (IR). Despite the heavy reliance of modern neural IR systems on LMs, little attention has been given to their handling of negation. In this study, we reproduce and extend the findings of NevIR, a benchmark study that revealed most IR models perform at or below the level of random ranking when dealing with negation. We replicate NevIR's original experiments and evaluate newly developed state-of-the-art IR models. Our findings show that a recently emerging category - listwise Large Language Model (LLM) rerankers - outperforms other models but still underperforms human performance. Additionally, we leverage ExcluIR, a benchmark dataset designed for exclusionary queries with extensive negation, to assess the generalizability of negation understanding. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning on one dataset does not reliably improve performance on the other, indicating notable differences in their data distributions. Furthermore, we observe that only cross-encoders and listwise LLM rerankers achieve reasonable performance across both negation tasks.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Clusters: Uniformity-Optimization for Text-Based Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional sequential recommendation (SR) methods heavily rely on explicit item IDs to capture user preferences over time. This reliance introduces critical limitations in cold-start scenarios and domain transfer tasks, where unseen items and new contexts often lack established ID mappings. To overcome these limitations, recent studies have shifted towards leveraging text-only information for recommendation, thereby improving model generalization and adaptability across domains. Although promising, text-based SR faces unique difficulties: items' text descriptions often share semantic similarities that lead to clustered item representations, compromising their uniformity, a property essential for promoting diversity and enhancing generalization in recommendation systems. In this paper, we explore a novel framework to improve the uniformity of item representations in text-based SR. Our analysis reveals that items within a sequence exhibit marked semantic similarity, meaning they are closer in representation than items overall, and that this effect is more pronounced for less popular items, which form tighter clusters compared to their more popular counterparts. Based on these findings, we propose UniT, a framework that employs three pairwise item sampling strategies: Unified General Sampling Strategy, Sequence-Driven Sampling Strategy, and Popularity-Driven Sampling Strategy. Each strategy applies varying degrees of repulsion to selectively adjust the distances between item pairs, thereby refining representation uniformity while considering both sequence context and item popularity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of UniT in enhancing both representation uniformity and recommendation accuracy.The source code is available at https://github.com/ccwwhhh/Model-Rec.</description>

      <title>Bursting Filter Bubble: Enhancing Serendipity Recommendations with Aligned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) often suffer from the feedback loop phenomenon, e.g., RSs are trained on data biased by their recommendations. This leads to the filter bubble effect that reinforces homogeneous content and reduces user satisfaction. To this end, serendipity recommendations, which offer unexpected yet relevant items, are proposed. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in serendipity prediction due to their extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, they still face challenges in aligning serendipity judgments with human assessments, handling long user behavior sequences, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial RSs. To address these issues, we propose SERAL (Serendipity Recommendations with Aligned Large Language Models), a framework comprising three stages: (1) Cognition Profile Generation to compress user behavior into multi-level profiles; (2) SerenGPT Alignment to align serendipity judgments with human preferences using enriched training data; and (3) Nearline Adaptation to integrate SerenGPT into industrial RSs pipelines efficiently. Online experiments demonstrate that SERAL improves exposure ratio (PVR), clicks, and transactions of serendipitous items by 5.7%, 29.56%, and 27.6%, enhancing user experience without much impact on overall revenue. Now, it has been fully deployed in the "Guess What You Like" of the Taobao App homepage.</description>

      <title>ActionPiece: Contextually Tokenizing Action Sequences for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions are tokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as predictions. However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, assigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences without considering contextual relationships. This lack of context-awareness can lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different meanings depending on its surrounding context. To address this issue, we propose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action sequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as a set of item features, which serve as the initial tokens. Given the action sequence corpora, we construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on their co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets. Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce set permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action sequences with the same semantics. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ActionPiece consistently outperforms existing action tokenization methods, improving NDCG@$10$ by $6.00\%$ to $12.82\%$.</description>

      <title>TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TalkPlay, a multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates the recommendation task as large language model token generation. TalkPlay represents music through an expanded token vocabulary that encodes multiple modalities - audio, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence. Using these rich representations, the model learns to generate recommendations through next-token prediction on music recommendation conversations, that requires learning the associations natural language query and response, as well as music items. In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations. In the experiment, TalkPlay is successfully trained and outperforms baseline methods in various aspects, demonstrating strong context understanding as a conversational music recommender.</description>

      <title>TrustRAG: An Information Assistant with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \Ac{RAG} has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing large models with real-time and domain-specific knowledge. While numerous improvements and open-source tools have been proposed to refine the \ac{RAG} framework for accuracy, relatively little attention has been given to improving the trustworthiness of generated results. To address this gap, we introduce TrustRAG, a novel framework that enhances \ac{RAG} from three perspectives: indexing, retrieval, and generation. Specifically, in the indexing stage, we propose a semantic-enhanced chunking strategy that incorporates hierarchical indexing to supplement each chunk with contextual information, ensuring semantic completeness. In the retrieval stage, we introduce a utility-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality information, supporting answer generation while reducing input length. In the generation stage, we propose fine-grained citation enhancement, which detects opinion-bearing sentences in responses and infers citation relationships at the sentence-level, thereby improving citation accuracy. We open-source the TrustRAG framework and provide a demonstration studio designed for excerpt-based question answering tasks \footnote{https://huggingface.co/spaces/golaxy/TrustRAG}. Based on these, we aim to help researchers: 1) systematically enhancing the trustworthiness of \ac{RAG} systems and (2) developing their own \ac{RAG} systems with more reliable outputs.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Graph Embeddings for Session-based Recommendation with Item Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In session-based recommender systems, predictions are based on the user's preceding behavior in the session. State-of-the-art sequential recommendation algorithms either use graph neural networks to model sessions in a graph or leverage the similarity of sessions by exploiting item features. In this paper, we combine these two approaches and propose a novel method, Graph Convolutional Network Extension (GCNext), which incorporates item features directly into the graph representation via graph convolutional networks. GCNext creates a feature-rich item co-occurrence graph and learns the corresponding item embeddings in an unsupervised manner. We show on three datasets that integrating GCNext into sequential recommendation algorithms significantly boosts the performance of nearest-neighbor methods as well as neural network models. Our flexible extension is easy to incorporate in state-of-the-art methods and increases the MRR@20 by up to 12.79%.</description>

      <title>Generative Large Recommendation Models: Emerging Trends in LLMs for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of information overload, recommendation systems play a pivotal role in filtering data and delivering personalized content. Recent advancements in feature interaction and user behavior modeling have significantly enhanced the recall and ranking processes of these systems. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to further improve recommendation systems. This tutorial explores two primary approaches for integrating LLMs: LLMs-enhanced recommendations, which leverage the reasoning capabilities of general LLMs, and generative large recommendation models, which focus on scaling and sophistication. While the former has been extensively covered in existing literature, the latter remains underexplored. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of generative large recommendation models, including their recent advancements, challenges, and potential research directions. Key topics include data quality, scaling laws, user behavior mining, and efficiency in training and inference. By engaging with this tutorial, participants will gain insights into the latest developments and future opportunities in the field, aiding both academic research and practical applications. The timely nature of this exploration supports the rapid evolution of recommendation systems, offering valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners alike.</description>

      <title>In-Place Updates of a Graph Index for Streaming Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indices for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) are a basic component for information retrieval and widely used in database, search, recommendation and RAG systems. In these scenarios, documents or other objects are inserted into and deleted from the working set at a high rate, requiring a stream of updates to the vector index. Algorithms based on proximity graph indices are the most efficient indices for ANNS, winning many benchmark competitions. However, it is challenging to update such graph index at a high rate, while supporting stable recall after many updates. Since the graph is singly-linked, deletions are hard because there is no fast way to find in-neighbors of a deleted vertex. Therefore, to update the graph, state-of-the-art algorithms such as FreshDiskANN accumulate deletions in a batch and periodically consolidate, removing edges to deleted vertices and modifying the graph to ensure recall stability. In this paper, we present IP-DiskANN (InPlaceUpdate-DiskANN), the first algorithm to avoid batch consolidation by efficiently processing each insertion and deletion in-place. Our experiments using standard benchmarks show that IP-DiskANN has stable recall over various lengthy update patterns in both high-recall and low-recall regimes. Further, its query throughput and update speed are better than using the batch consolidation algorithm and HNSW.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Popularity Bias in Collaborative Filtering through Fair Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems often suffer from popularity bias, where frequently interacted items are overrepresented in recommendations. This bias stems from propensity factors influencing training data, leading to imbalanced exposure. In this paper, we introduce a Fair Sampling (FS) approach to address this issue by ensuring that both users and items are selected with equal probability as positive and negative instances. Unlike traditional inverse propensity score (IPS) methods, FS does not require propensity estimation, eliminating errors associated with inaccurate calculations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that FS effectively neutralizes the influence of propensity factors, achieving unbiased learning. Experimental results validate that FS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both point-wise and pair-wise recommendation tasks, enhancing recommendation fairness without sacrificing accuracy. The implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Fair-Sampling.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cross-Domain Recommendations with Memory-Optimized LLM-Based User Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based user agents have emerged as a powerful tool for improving recommender systems by simulating user interactions. However, existing methods struggle with cross-domain scenarios due to inefficient memory structures, leading to irrelevant information retention and failure to account for social influence factors such as popularity. To address these limitations, we introduce AgentCF++, a novel framework featuring a dual-layer memory architecture and a two-step fusion mechanism to filter domain-specific preferences effectively. Additionally, we propose interest groups with shared memory, allowing the model to capture the impact of popularity trends on users with similar interests. Through extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets, AgentCF++ demonstrates superior performance over baseline models, highlighting its effectiveness in refining user behavior simulation for recommender systems. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AgentCF-plus.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Recommendations Through Personalized Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current recommendation systems powered by large language models (LLMs) often underutilize their reasoning capabilities due to a lack of explicit logical structuring. To address this limitation, we introduce CoT-Rec, a framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-driven recommendations by incorporating two crucial processes: user preference analysis and item perception evaluation. CoT-Rec operates in two key phases: (1) personalized data extraction, where user preferences and item perceptions are identified, and (2) personalized data application, where this information is leveraged to refine recommendations. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that CoT-Rec improves recommendation accuracy by making better use of LLMs' reasoning potential. The implementation is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CoT-Rec.</description>

      <title>Judging the Judges: A Collection of LLM-Generated Relevance Judgements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) for relevance assessments offers promising opportunities to improve Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and related fields. Indeed, LLMs hold the promise of allowing IR experimenters to build evaluation collections with a fraction of the manual human labor currently required. This could help with fresh topics on which there is still limited knowledge and could mitigate the challenges of evaluating ranking systems in low-resource scenarios, where it is challenging to find human annotators. Given the fast-paced recent developments in the domain, many questions concerning LLMs as assessors are yet to be answered. Among the aspects that require further investigation, we can list the impact of various components in a relevance judgment generation pipeline, such as the prompt used or the LLM chosen.
  This paper benchmarks and reports on the results of a large-scale automatic relevance judgment evaluation, the LLMJudge challenge at SIGIR 2024, where different relevance assessment approaches were proposed. In detail, we release and benchmark 42 LLM-generated labels of the TREC 2023 Deep Learning track relevance judgments produced by eight international teams who participated in the challenge. Given their diverse nature, these automatically generated relevance judgments can help the community not only investigate systematic biases caused by LLMs but also explore the effectiveness of ensemble models, analyze the trade-offs between different models and human assessors, and advance methodologies for improving automated evaluation techniques.

      <title>Lost in Sequence: Do Large Language Models Understand Sequential Recommendation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for recommendation thanks to their advanced textual understanding ability and context-awareness. Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/LLM-SRec.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Research Portfolio For Semantic Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citation metrics are widely used to assess academic impact but suffer from social biases, including institutional prestige and journal visibility. Here we introduce rXiv Semantic Impact (XSI), a novel framework that predicts research impact by analyzing how scientific semantic graphs evolve in underlying fabric of science. Rather than counting citations, XSI tracks the evolution of research concepts in the academic knowledge graph (KG). Starting with a construction of a comprehensive KG from 324K biomedical publications (2003-2025), we demonstrate that XSI can predict a paper's future semantic impact (SI) with remarkable accuracy ($R^2$ = 0.69) three years in advance. We leverage these predictions to develop an optimization framework for research portfolio selection that systematically outperforms random allocation. We propose SI as a complementary metric to citations and present XSI as a tool to guide funding and publishing decisions, enhancing research impact while mitigating risk.</description>

      <title>SearchRAG: Can Search Engines Be Helpful for LLM-based Medical Question Answering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains but often struggle with tasks requiring specialized knowledge. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques typically retrieve external information from static knowledge bases, which can be outdated or incomplete, missing fine-grained clinical details essential for accurate medical question answering. In this work, we propose SearchRAG, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by leveraging real-time search engines. Our method employs synthetic query generation to convert complex medical questions into search-engine-friendly queries and utilizes uncertainty-based knowledge selection to filter and incorporate the most relevant and informative medical knowledge into the LLM's input. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves response accuracy in medical question answering tasks, particularly for complex questions requiring detailed and up-to-date knowledge.</description>

      <title>MMTEB: Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings are typically evaluated on a limited set of tasks, which are constrained by language, domain, and task diversity. To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale, community-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of challenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we develop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a representative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain language subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available model is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To facilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel downsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse selection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that drastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced zero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale version but at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>PeerQA: A Scientific Question Answering Dataset from Peer Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PeerQA, a real-world, scientific, document-level Question Answering (QA) dataset. PeerQA questions have been sourced from peer reviews, which contain questions that reviewers raised while thoroughly examining the scientific article. Answers have been annotated by the original authors of each paper. The dataset contains 579 QA pairs from 208 academic articles, with a majority from ML and NLP, as well as a subset of other scientific communities like Geoscience and Public Health. PeerQA supports three critical tasks for developing practical QA systems: Evidence retrieval, unanswerable question classification, and answer generation. We provide a detailed analysis of the collected dataset and conduct experiments establishing baseline systems for all three tasks. Our experiments and analyses reveal the need for decontextualization in document-level retrieval, where we find that even simple decontextualization approaches consistently improve retrieval performance across architectures. On answer generation, PeerQA serves as a challenging benchmark for long-context modeling, as the papers have an average size of 12k tokens. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/UKPLab/peerqa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Product Search (CPS) is confined to simulated conversations due to the lack of real-world CPS datasets that reflect human-like language. Additionally, current conversational datasets are limited to support cross-market and multi-lingual usage. In this paper, we introduce a new CPS data collection protocol and present PSCon, a novel CPS dataset designed to assist product search via human-like conversations. The dataset is constructed using a coached human-to-human data collection protocol and supports two languages and dual markets. Also, the dataset enables thorough exploration of six subtasks of CPS: user intent detection, keyword extraction, system action prediction, question selection, item ranking, and response generation. Furthermore, we also offer an analysis of the dataset and propose a benchmark model on the proposed CPS dataset.</description>

      <title>One Model for All: Large Language Models are Domain-Agnostic Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next likely interaction based on their history. However, these systems face data sparsity and cold-start problems. Utilizing data from other domains, known as multi-domain methods, is useful for alleviating these problems. However, traditional multi-domain methods rely on meaningless ID-based item representation, which makes it difficult to align items with similar meanings from different domains, yielding sup-optimal knowledge transfer. This paper introduces LLM-Rec, a framework that utilizes pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for domain-agnostic recommendation. Specifically, we mix user's behaviors from multiple domains and concatenate item titles into a sentence, then use LLMs for generating user and item representations. By mixing behaviors across different domains, we can exploit the knowledge encoded in LLMs to bridge the semantic across over multi-domain behaviors, thus obtaining semantically rich representations and improving performance in all domains. Furthermore, we explore the underlying reasons why LLMs are effective and investigate whether LLMs can understand the semantic correlations as the recommendation model, and if advanced techniques like scaling laws in NLP also work in recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs ranging from 40M to 6.7B to answer the above questions and to verify the effectiveness of LLM-Rec in multi-domain recommendation.</description>

      <title>Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and item providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raises the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias, and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve item-side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) Fairness-aware attention, which incorporates the dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees. ii) Heterophily feature weighting, to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. To evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates unfairness and popularity bias on the item side but also achieves superior accuracy on the user side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</description>

      <title>Agentic Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, information retrieval (IR) has long been defined as the process of acquiring relevant information items from a pre-defined corpus to satisfy user information needs. Traditional IR systems, while effective in domains like web search, are constrained by their reliance on static, pre-defined information items. To this end, this paper introduces agentic information retrieval (Agentic IR), a transformative next-generation paradigm for IR driven by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. The central shift in agentic IR is the evolving definition of ``information'' from static, pre-defined information items to dynamic, context-dependent information states. Information state refers to a particular information context that the user is right in within a dynamic environment, encompassing not only the acquired information items but also real-time user preferences, contextual factors, and decision-making processes. In such a way, traditional information retrieval, focused on acquiring relevant information items based on user queries, can be naturally extended to achieving the target information state given the user instruction, which thereby defines the agentic information retrieval. We systematically discuss agentic IR from various aspects, i.e., task formulation, architecture, evaluation, case studies, as well as challenges and future prospects. We believe that the concept of agentic IR introduced in this paper not only broadens the scope of information retrieval research but also lays the foundation for a more adaptive, interactive, and intelligent next-generation IR paradigm.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models in Recommendation Systems: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems remain an essential topic due to its wide application in various domains and the business potential behind them. With the rise of deep learning, common solutions have leveraged neural networks to facilitate collaborative filtering, and some have turned to generative adversarial networks to augment the dataset and tackle the data sparsity issue. However, they are limited in learning the complex user and item distribution and still suffer from model collapse. Given the great generation capability exhibited by diffusion models in computer vision recently, many recommender systems have adopted diffusion models and found improvements in performance for various tasks. Diffusion models in recommender systems excel in managing complex user and item distributions and do not suffer from mode collapse. With these advantages, the amount of research in this domain have been growing rapidly and calling for a systematic survey. In this survey paper, we present and propose a taxonomy on past research papers in recommender systems that utilize diffusion models. Distinct from a prior survey paper that categorizes based on the role of the diffusion model, we categorize based on the recommendation task at hand. The decision originates from the rationale that after all, the adoption of diffusion models is to enhance the recommendation performance, not vice versa: adapting the recommendation task to enable diffusion models. Nonetheless, we offer a unique perspective for diffusion models in recommender systems complementary to existing surveys. We present the foundation algorithms in diffusion models and their applications in recommender systems to summarize the rapid development in this field. Finally, we discuss open research directions to prepare and encourage further efforts to advance the field. We compile the relevant papers in a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Emancipatory Information Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Our world today is facing a confluence of several mutually reinforcing crises each of which intersects with concerns of social justice and emancipation. This paper is a provocation for the role of computer-mediated information access in our emancipatory struggles. We define emancipatory information retrieval as the study and development of information access methods that challenge various forms of human oppression, and situates its activities within broader collective emancipatory praxis. The term "emancipatory" here signifies the moral concerns of universal humanization of all peoples and the elimination of oppression to create the conditions under which we can collectively flourish. To develop an emancipatory research agenda for information retrieval (IR), in this paper we speculate about the practices that the community can adopt, enumerate some of the projects that the field should undertake, and discuss provocations to spark new ideas and directions for research. We challenge the field of IR research to embrace humanistic values and commit to universal emancipation and social justice. We also invite scholars from fields such as human-computer interaction, information sciences, media studies, design, social sciences, humanities, democratic theory, and critical theory, as well as legal and policy experts, civil rights and social justice activists, and artists to join us in realizing this transformation. In this process, we must both imagine post-oppressive worlds, and reimagine the role of IR in that world and in the journey that leads us there.</description>

      <title>Planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and nonmonotonic temperature-dependence in the supercooled region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and study it by the cavity method of statistical mechanics. Different from conventional Ising models, the equilibrium ferromagnetic phase transition of this binary-spin two-body interaction system is discontinuous, as the paramagnetic phase is separated from the ferromagnetic phase by an extensive free energy barrier. The free energy landscape can be distinguished into three different types depending on the two degree parameters of the planted graph. The critical inverse temperatures at which the paramagnetic phase becomes locally unstable towards the ferromagnetic phase ($\beta_{\textrm{pf}}$) and towards spin glass phases ($\beta_{\textrm{pg}}$) satisfy $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &gt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &lt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$ and $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} = \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, respectively, in these three landscapes. A locally stable anti-ferromagnetic phase emerges in the free energy landscape if $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &lt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$. When exploring the free energy landscape by stochastic local search dynamics, we find that in agreement with our theoretical prediction, the first-passage time from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase is nonmonotonic with the inverse temperature. The potential relevance of the planted vertex cover model to supercooled glass-forming liquids is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</description>

      <title>CoSQA+: Pioneering the Multi-Choice Code Search Benchmark with Test-Driven Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11589</link>

Abstract: Semantic code search, retrieving code that matches a given natural language query, is an important task to improve productivity in software engineering. Existing code search datasets face limitations: they rely on human annotators who assess code primarily through semantic understanding rather than functional verification, leading to potential inaccuracies and scalability issues. Additionally, current evaluation metrics often overlook the multi-choice nature of code search. This paper introduces CoSQA+, pairing high-quality queries from CoSQA with multiple suitable codes. We develop an automated pipeline featuring multiple model-based candidate selections and the novel test-driven agent annotation system. Among a single Large Language Model (LLM) annotator and Python expert annotators (without test-based verification), agents leverage test-based verification and achieve the highest accuracy of 96.4%. Through extensive experiments, CoSQA+ has demonstrated superior quality over CoSQA. Models trained on CoSQA+ exhibit improved performance. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/CoSQA_Plus.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Non-Factoid Question Answering with Answer Paragraph Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing Question Answering Datasets (QuADs) primarily focus on factoid-based short-context Question Answering (QA) in high-resource languages. However, the scope of such datasets for low-resource languages remains limited, with only a few works centered on factoid-based QuADs and none on non-factoid QuADs. Therefore, this work presents MuNfQuAD, a multilingual QuAD with non-factoid questions. It utilizes interrogative sub-headings from BBC news articles as questions and the corresponding paragraphs as silver answers. The dataset comprises over 578K QA pairs across 38 languages, encompassing several low-resource languages, and stands as the largest multilingual QA dataset to date. Based on the manual annotations of 790 QA-pairs from MuNfQuAD (golden set), we observe that 98\% of questions can be answered using their corresponding silver answer. Our fine-tuned Answer Paragraph Selection (APS) model outperforms the baselines. The APS model attained an accuracy of 80\% and 72\%, as well as a macro F1 of 72\% and 66\%, on the MuNfQuAD testset and the golden set, respectively. Furthermore, the APS model effectively generalizes a certain language within the golden set, even after being fine-tuned on silver labels. We also observe that the fine-tuned APS model is beneficial for reducing the context of a question. These findings suggest that this resource would be a valuable contribution to the QA research community.</description>
