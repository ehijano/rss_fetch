      <title>From Individuals to Crowds: Dual-Level Public Response Prediction in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public response prediction is critical for understanding how individuals or groups might react to specific events, policies, or social phenomena, making it highly valuable for crisis management, policy-making, and social media analysis. However, existing works face notable limitations. First, they lack micro-level personalization, producing generic responses that ignore individual user preferences. Moreover, they overlook macro-level sentiment distribution and only deal with individual-level sentiment, constraining them from analyzing broader societal trends and group sentiment dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose SocialAlign, a unified framework that predicts real-world responses at both micro and macro levels in social contexts. At the micro level, SocialAlign employs SocialLLM with an articulate Personalized Analyze-Compose LoRA (PAC-LoRA) structure, which deploys specialized expert modules for content analysis and response generation across diverse topics and user profiles, enabling the generation of personalized comments with corresponding sentiments. At the macro level, it models group sentiment distributions and aligns predictions with real-world sentiment trends derived from social media data. To evaluate SocialAlign in real-world scenarios, we introduce SentiWeibo, a large-scale dataset curated from authentic social interactions on the Weibo platform. Experimental results on our SentiWeibo and related LaMP benchmark demonstrate that SocialAlign surpasses strong baselines, showing improved accuracy, interpretability, and generalization in public response prediction. We hope our work inspires further research in public response prediction and computational social science: https://github.com/Znull-1220/SocialAlign.</description>

      <title>Agency Among Agents: Designing with Hypertextual Friction in the Algorithmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed. This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation, and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance, associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an increasingly algorithmic web.</description>

      <title>Data Bias in Human Mobility is a Universal Phenomenon but is Highly Location-specific</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility datasets play increasingly critical roles in many algorithmic systems, business processes and policy decisions. Unfortunately there has been little focus on understanding bias and other fundamental shortcomings of the datasets and how they impact downstream analyses and prediction tasks. In this work, we study `data production', quantifying not only whether individuals are represented in big digital datasets, but also how they are represented in terms of how much data they produce. We study GPS mobility data collected from anonymized smartphones for ten major US cities and find that data points can be more unequally distributed between users than wealth. We build models to predict the number of data points we can expect to be produced by the composition of demographic groups living in census tracts, and find strong effects of wealth, ethnicity, and education on data production. While we find that bias is a universal phenomenon, occurring in all cities, we further find that each city suffers from its own manifestation of it, and that location-specific models are required to model bias for each city. This work raises serious questions about general approaches to debias human mobility data and urges further research.</description>

      <title>A Novel Dynamic Epidemic Model for Successive Opinion Diffusion in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic epidemic model for successive opinion diffusion in social networks, extending the SHIMR model. It incorporates dynamic decision-making influenced by social distances and captures accumulative opinion diffusion caused by interrelated rumors. The model reflects the impact of rumor spread on social network structures. Simulations validate its effectiveness in explaining phenomena like the echo chamber effect and provide insights into opinion diffusion dynamics, with implications for understanding social polarization and network evolution.</description>

      <title>Block-corrected Modularity for Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.</description>

      <title>Debunking with Dialogue? Exploring AI-Generated Counterspeech to Challenge Conspiracy Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterspeech is a key strategy against harmful online content, but scaling expert-driven efforts is challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a potential solution, though their use in countering conspiracy theories is under-researched. Unlike for hate speech, no datasets exist that pair conspiracy theory comments with expert-crafted counterspeech. We address this gap by evaluating the ability of GPT-4o, Llama 3, and Mistral to effectively apply counterspeech strategies derived from psychological research provided through structured prompts. Our results show that the models often generate generic, repetitive, or superficial results. Additionally, they over-acknowledge fear and frequently hallucinate facts, sources, or figures, making their prompt-based use in practical applications problematic.</description>
