      <title>Epics Deployment at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermilab has traditionally not been an EPICS house; as such expertise in EPICS is limited and scattered. PIP-II will be using EPICS for its control system. When in operation, it will need to interface with the existing, modernized (see ACORN) legacy control system. Treating EPICS controls at Fermilab as a green field, we have developed and deployed a software pipeline which addresses these needs and presents to developers a tested and robust software framework, including template IOCs from which new developers can quickly deploy new front ends, aka IOCs. In this presentation, motivation for this work, implementation of a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline, testing, template IOCs, and the deployment of user services/applications will be discussed. This new infrastructure of IOCs and services is being developed and used in the PIP-II cryomodule teststand; our experiences and lessons learned will be also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Full Inverse Compton Scattering: Total Transfer of Energy and Momentum from Electrons to Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss a peculiar regime of Compton Scattering that assures the maximum transfer of energy and momentum from free electrons propagating in vacuum to the scattered photons. We name this regime Full Inverse Compton Scattering (FICS) because it is characterized by the maximum and full energy loss of the electrons in collision with photons: up to 100 % of the electron kinetic energy is indeed transferred to the photon. In the case of relativistic electrons, characterized by a large Lorentz factor (gamma &gt;&gt; 1), FICS regime corresponds to an incident photon energy equal to mec^2/2 . We interpret such an astonishing result as FICS being the time reversal of direct Compton Scattering of very energetic photons (of energy much greater than mec2) onto atomic electrons. Although the cross section of Compton scattering is decreasing with the energy of the incident photon, making the process less probable with respect to other reactions (pair production, nuclear reactions, etc) when high energetic photons are bombarding a target, the kinematics straightforwardly implies that the back-scattered photons would have an energy reaching asymptotically me^2c^2 . FICS is instead the unique suitable working point in Compton scattering for achieving the total transfer of (kinetic) energy exactly from the electron to the photon. Experiencing transitions from the initial momentum to zero in the laboratory system, in FICS the electron is also subject to very large negative acceleration; this fact can lead to possible experiments of sensing the Unruh temperature and related photon bath. On the other side of the energy dynamic range, low relativistic electrons can be completely stopped by moderate energy photons (tens of keV), leading to full exchange of temperature between electron clouds and photon baths.</description>

      <title>Highly-efficient electron ponderomotive acceleration in underdense plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-plasma accelerators represent a promising technology for future compact accelerating systems, enabling the acceleration of tens of pC to above $1\,$GeV over just a few centimeters. Nonetheless, these devices currently lack the stability, beam quality and average current of conventional systems. While many efforts have focused on improving acceleration stability and quality, little progress has been made in increasing the beam's average current, which is essential for future laser-plasma-based applications. In this paper, we investigate a laser-plasma acceleration regime aimed at increasing the beam average current with energies up to few-MeVs, efficiently enhancing the beam charge. We present experimental results on configurations that allow reaching charges of $5-30\,$nC and a maximum conversion efficiency of around $14\,$%. Through comprehensive Particle-In-Cell simulations, we interpret the experimental results and present a detailed study on electron dynamics. From our analysis, we show that most electrons are not trapped in a plasma wave; rather, they experience ponderomotive acceleration. Thus, we prove the laser pulse as the main driver of the particles' energy gain process.</description>

      <title>Matched Guiding and Controlled Injection in Dark-Current-Free, 10-GeV-Class, Channel-Guided Laser Plasma Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the high intensity laser propagation throughout meter-scale, channel-guided LPAs by adjusting the length of the plasma channel on a shot-by-shot basis, showing high quality guiding of 500 TW laser pulses over 30 cm in a hydrogen plasma of density $n_0 \approx 1 \times 10^{17} \, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. We observed transverse energy transport of higher-order modes in the first $\approx 12 \, \mathrm{cm}$ of the plasma channel, followed by quasi-matched propagation, and the gradual, dark-current-free depletion of laser energy to the wakefield. We quantify the laser-to-wake transfer efficiency limitations of currently available PW-class laser systems, and demonstrate via simulation how control over the laser mode can significantly improve accelerated beam parameters. Using just 21.3 J of laser energy, and triggering localized electron injection into the accelerator, we observed electron bunches with single, quasimonoenergetic peaks, relative energy spreads as low as 3 % and energy up to 9.2 GeV with charge extending beyond 10 GeV.</description>

      <title>Excitation of nonlinear second order betatron sidebands for Knock Out slow extraction at the third-integer resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Knock Out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Classically, the beam is excited with an RF field comprising a frequency band around one of the betatron sidebands. This article demonstrates that the third-integer resonance commonly used for the slow extraction induces nonlinear motion, resulting in the appearance of additional sidebands of higher order at multiples of the betatron tune. Measured and simulated beam spectra are presented, revealing these sidebands and the beam's response to being excited at first and second order sidebands. The feasibility of using a second order sideband for the purpose of slow extraction is demonstrated. This results in a significant improvement in the temporal structure (spill quality) of the extracted beam, but at the cost of higher excitation power requirements. This is observed both experimentally and in tracking simulations. The mechanism behind the observed improvement is explained using beam dynamics simulations.</description>
