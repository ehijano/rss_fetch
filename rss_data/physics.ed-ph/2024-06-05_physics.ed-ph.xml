      <title>V-SeMo: a digital learning environment for teaching general relativity with sector models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The teaching of general relativity at the secondary school and lower undergraduate university levels is necessarily based on approaches with a restricted use of mathematics. An important aspect of teaching general relativity at this level are suitable learner activities. While a substantial number of such activities has been reported for studying the non-Euclidean geometry of curved surfaces, there are far fewer reports of activities that let learners actually study spacetimes and infer physical phenomena from their geometry. In this article we report on the digital learning environment V-SeMo that brings sector models (Zahn and Kraus 2014, arXiv:1405.0323) into an interactive web application. V-SeMo lets learners explore relativistic spacetimes by constructing geodesics and assessing curvature. We describe the didactic design and the user interface of V-SeMo, discuss the extended possibilities of virtual sector models compared to the paper models described previously, and present an activity on light deflection near neutron stars by way of example. We further report on an evaluation carried out with secondary school students. Results indicate a high learning effectiveness in both the V-SeMo-based and the paper-based versions of a teaching unit on relativistic light deflection. The teaching materials presented in this article are available online for teaching purposes at https://www.spacetimetravel.org .</description>
