      <title>Maximally supersymmetric Yang--Mills in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the latest results from our ongoing lattice field theory investigations of maximally supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory in three space-time dimensions, focusing on its non-perturbative phase diagram. Exploiting a lattice formulation that preserves a subset of the supersymmetry algebra at non-zero lattice spacing, we study the 'spatial deconfinement' phase transition that holography relates to the transition between localized and homogeneous black branes in the dual quantum gravity. Fixing $N_L^2 \times 8$ lattice volumes and N=8 colors in the SU(N) gauge group, we consider four aspect ratios $\alpha = N_L / N_T \leq 4$ corresponding to $N_L = 16$, $20$, $24$ and $32$. The transition temperatures we determine are in good agreement with the low-temperature, large-N holographic expectation $T_c \propto \alpha^3$.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomalies and Wilson fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wilson formulation of fermions in lattice gauge theory provides a unified description of the chiral anomalies in the standard model. The discrete Dirac operator diagonalizes into a series of two by two blocks. In each block the possible eigenvalues either form a complex pair or separate into two real eigenvalues that have specific chirality. The collision of these pairs of eigenvalues occurs outside the perturbative region and provides a path between topological sectors.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified viewpoint of Gribov--Zwanziger and Serreau--Tissier gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a unified Landau--gauge fixing that continuously interpolates between the viewpoints of the Serreau--Tissier (ST) copy-averaged formulation and the (Refined) Gribov--Zwanziger (RGZ) restriction to the first Gribov region. By combining the ST weight with a GZ-type horizon term and localizing both through the replica trick and the BRST-invariant $A_\mu^h$ formulation, we obtain a single, local, BRST-invariant, power-counting renormalizable action. Algebraic renormalization shows that all counterterms are reabsorbed by a common set of field and parameter renormalizations, therefore the unification is algebraic rather than merely additive. The replica sector yields a radiatively generated gluon screening mass, while the RGZ parameters are fixed by the horizon and condensate gap equations; we also give infrared matching conditions that link both descriptions at small momentum. We present a compact BRST-superspace rewriting of the RGZ block and a simple hybrid superspace that hosts the ST replicas and RGZ side by side; these add no dynamics and organize the Ward-identity analysis. The resulting gluon propagator interpolates among the massive Faddeev--Popov--ST and the RGZ decoupling forms. This framework offers a controlled way to study how infrared Yang--Mills correlators depend on the balance between copy averaging and horizon suppression, and it suggests practical lattice tests through tunable copy weighting.</description>

      <title>Renormalized dual basis for scalable simulations of 2+1D compact quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical and quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with Lie groups is hindered by the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of gauge degrees of freedom. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. X 15, 031065 (2025)], we introduced a new truncation scheme -- here renamed as Renormalized Dual Basis (RDB) -- based on the resolution of the single-plaquette problem, and demonstrated its performance for SU(2) LGTs. In this paper, we apply the RDB to compact quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in three spacetime dimensions (2+1D). We variationally determine the ground state of the theory for small lattices with periodic (for pure gauge) and open (in presence of fermionic matter) boundary conditions, achieving improved precision for the plaquette operator compared to previous approaches. By leveraging tensor networks, we extend the study to larger lattices and demonstrate the scalability of the method. Overall, we show that the RDB provides an efficient description across all coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Modulated symmetries from generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries rigidly delimit the landscape of quantum matter. Recently uncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position, enable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable. In one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated symmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains incomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated dipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the presence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field theoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly inflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries. Our results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM constraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Global QCD analysis of spin PDFs in the proton with high-$x$ and lattice constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>
