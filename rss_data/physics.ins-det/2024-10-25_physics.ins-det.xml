      <title>A method to detect the VUV photons from cooled $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thorium-229, with its exceptionally low-energy nuclear excited state, is a key candidate for developing nuclear clocks. $^{229}$Th-doped CaF$_2$ crystals, benefiting from calcium fluoride's wide band gap, show great promise as solid-state nuclear clock materials. These crystals are excited by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, which over time cause radiation damage. Cooling the crystals can mitigate this damage but introduces a challenge: photoabsorption. This occurs when residual gas molecules condense on the crystal surface, absorbing VUV photons and deteriorating detection efficiency. To solve this, we developed a cooling technique using a copper shield to surround the crystal, acting as a cold trap. This prevents ice-layer formation, even at temperatures below $-100\,^\circ$C, preserving high VUV photon detection efficiency. Our study detailed the experimental cooling setup and demonstrated the effectiveness of the copper shield in maintaining crystal performance, a critical improvement for future solid-state nuclear clocks operating at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Ion manipulation from liquid Xe to vacuum: Ba-tagging for a nEXO upgrade and future 0{\nu}\b{eta}\b{eta} experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0 \nu \beta \beta$) provides a way to probe physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The upcoming nEXO experiment will search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{136}$Xe with a projected half-life sensitivity exceeding $10^{28}$ years at the 90\% confidence level using a liquid xenon (LXe) Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with 5 tonnes of Xe enriched to $\sim$90\% in the $\beta \beta$-decaying isotope $^{136}$Xe. In parallel, a potential future upgrade to nEXO is being investigated with the aim to further suppress radioactive backgrounds, and to confirm $\beta \beta$-decay events. This technique, known as Ba-tagging, comprises of extracting and identifying the $\beta \beta$-decay daughter $^{136}$Ba ion. One tagging approach being pursued involves extracting a small volume of LXe in the vicinity of a potential $\beta \beta$-decay using a capillary tube and facilitating a liquid to gas phase transition by heating the capillary exit. The Ba ion is then separated from the accompanying Xe gas using a radio-frequency (RF) carpet and RF funnel, conclusively identifying the ion as $^{136}$Ba via laser-fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, an accelerator-driven Ba ion source is being developed to validate and optimize this technique. The motivation for the project, the development of the different aspects along with current status and results are discussed here.</description>

      <title>Thermal architecture for a cryogenic super-pressure balloon payload: design and development of the Taurus flight cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the cryogenic system being developed for Taurus: a super-pressure balloon-borne microwave polarimeter scheduled to fly in 2027. The Taurus cryogenic system consists of a 660L liquid helium cryostat which achieves a base temperature of &lt;100mK with the help of a capillary-fed superfluid tank and a closed cycle dilution refrigerator. The main tank is supported with fiberglass flexures and is encased in two layers of vapor-cooled shields which allow Taurus to make full use of the extended flight time offered by the super-pressure balloon platform. The Taurus cryostat is projected to hold for over 50 days while weighing under 1000lbs. We present the design, testing, and thermal analysis of the Taurus cryogenic systems.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave-Sensitive Photonic-Like Electronic Transport in Graphene for Efficient High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves are crucial for understanding the very early universe and distinguishing between various cosmological models, but detecting them remains a significant challenge. We investigated the effects of high-frequency gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport in graphene. The results show that, unlike the influence of gravitational waves on the propagation of light, the influence of gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport can accumulate not only in real space but also in $k$-space. This makes photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves similar to the propagation of light in a medium where the refractive index varies dramatically due to gravitational waves, and with shorter wavelengths. As a result, the relative intensity variation in photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves exceeds that of a laser interferometer with the same arm length by six orders of magnitude. At low temperatures, the influence of phonons on photon-like transport in the context of high-frequency gravitational waves can be ignored. These findings indicate a strong interaction between gravitational waves and electron transport, which helps to deepen the understanding of the interaction between gravitational waves and matter, and provides a different method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The CRILIN calorimeter: gamma radiation resistance of crystals and SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crilin calorimeter is a semi-homogeneous calorimetric system based on Lead Fluoride (PbF$_2$) crystals with UV-extended Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) proposed for the Muon Collider. This study investigates the radiation resistance of crystals and SiPMs, subjected to 10 kGy gamma irradiation, equivalent to a 10-year service life in the Muon Collider. Our findings indicate that while PbF$_2$ crystals exhibit a decrease in transmittance post-irradiation with partial recovery over time, the alternative PbWO$_4$-Ultra Fast (PWO-UF) demonstrates exceptional radiation hardness, maintaining stable transmittance. SiPMs showed an increase in dark current and breakdown voltage post-irradiation, with less degradation observed in the SiPM biased during the exposure to radiation compared to the unbiased component. These results underscore the viability of PbF$_2$ for radiation-tolerant calorimeters, though improvements in production homogeneity are needed. The superior performance of PWO-UF crystals suggests they are a promising alternative for high-radiation applications, but their higher cost must be carefully considered.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the data aggregation concepts for STS readout in the CBM Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The STS detector in the CBM experiment delivers data via multiple E-Links connected to GBTX ASICs. In the process of data aggregation, that data must be received, combined into a smaller number of streams, and packed into so-called microslices containing data from specific periods. The aggregation must consider data randomization due to amplitude-dependent processing time in the FEE ASICs and different occupancy of individual E-Links. During the development of the STS readout, the continued progress in the available technology affected the requirements for data aggregation, its architecture, and algorithms. The contribution presents considered solutions and discusses their properties.</description>

      <title>Initial PIP-II Beam Current Monitor Fault Case Analyses &amp; Beam Position Monitor Linearity Studies in CST Studio Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of non-invasive sensors &amp; systems to measure particle beam characteristics is a crucial part of modern accelerator control systems due to their ability to return real time passive measurements without impacting the beam quality. Simulations, which can predict these sensors' behaviour and performance under anticipated accelerator conditions, are valuable tools to ensure confidence in the sensors' functionality prior to a physical bench test. This paper details the design, testing, and results of two sensor models developed using CST Studio Suite software. One model is an elliptical, large-aperture beam position monitor (BPM) for which vertical &amp; horizontal position signal linearity was analyzed. The second model is an AC current transformer (ACCT) beam current monitor (BCM), which was used to search for potential fault cases within the BCM and beam pipe flange gaps. Fermilab Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) accelerator beam conditions were applied, and special focus is given to the discovery of linearity variations within the BPM as well as the use of frequency domain techniques in the BCM fault case analyses.</description>

      <title>Remote Detection of Applications for Improved Beam Tracking in mmWave/sub-THz 5G/6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam tracking is an essential functionality of millimeter wave (mmWave, 30-100 GHz) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz, 100-300 GHz) 5G/6G systems. It operates by performing antenna sweeping at both base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) sides using the Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB). The optimal frequency of beam tracking events is not specified by 3GPP standards and heavily depends on the micromobility properties of the applications currently utilized by the user. In absence of explicit signalling for the type of application at the air interface, in this paper, we propose a way to remotely detect it at the BS side based on the received signal strength pattern. To this aim, we first perform a multi-stage measurement campaign at 156 GHz, belonging to the sub-THz band, to obtain the received signal strength traces of popular smartphone applications. Then, we proceed applying conventional statistical Mann-Whitney tests and various machine learning (ML) based classification techniques to discriminate applications remotely. Our results show that Mann-Whitney test can be used to differentiate between fast and slow application classes with a confidence of 0.95 inducing class detection delay on the order of 1 s after application initialization. With the same time budget, random forest classifiers can differentiate between applications with fast and slow micromobility with 80% accuracy using received signal strength metric only. The accuracy of detecting a specific application however is lower, reaching 60%. By utilizing the proposed technique one can estimate the optimal values of the beam tracking intervals without adding additional signalling to the air interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous conversion of muonium to antimuonium is one of the interesting charged lepton flavor violation phenomena, offering a sensitive probe of potential new physics and serving as a tool to constrain the parameter space beyond the Standard Model. Utilizing a high-intensity muon beam, a Michel electron magnetic spectrometer and a positron transport solenoid together with a positron detection system, MACE aims to discover or constrain this rare process at the conversion probability beyond the level of $10^{-13}$. This report provides an overview of the theoretical framework and detailed experimental design in the search for the muonium-to-antimuonium conversion.</description>

      <title>Long term remote reactor power and fuel composition monitoring using antineutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron antineutrinos are emitted in the decay chains of the fission products inside a reactor core and could be used for remote monitoring of nuclear reactors. The DANSS detector is placed under the core of the 3.1 GW power reactor at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) and collects up to 5000 antineutrino events per day. DANSS measured changes of the reactor power by antineutrino counting rates over 7 years with 1.0% accuracy in one week periods. The systematic uncertainty of this measurement is less than 0.8%. It is comparable to the accuracy of conventional methods of the reactor power measurements while it is based on completely different approach. For the first time the 239Pu and 235U fission fractions were reconstructed using antineutrino inverse beta-decay spectrum which is a completely new technique. This method was applied to the data from three reactor fuel campaigns (approximately 1.5 year each). The reconstructed fission fractions in about one week measurements and the fission fractions provided by KNPP coincide within about 3% accuracy. This provides confidence in both completely different approaches of the fission fraction determination.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diamond Microscope for Narrowband Magnetic Imaging with High Spatial and Spectral Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) is a recently developed technology for near-field imaging of magnetic fields with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the present work, we integrate a QDM with a narrowband measurement protocol and a lock-in camera; and demonstrate imaging of radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field patterns produced by microcoils, with spectral resolution $\approx1$\,Hz. This RF-QDM provides multi-frequency imaging with a central detection frequency that is easily tunable over the MHz-scale, allowing spatial discrimination of both crowded spectral peaks and spectrally well-separated signals. The present instrument has spatial resolution $\approx2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, field-of-view $\approx300\times300\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$, and per-pixel sensitivity to narrowband fields $\sim{1}\,$nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Spatial noise can be reduced to the picotesla scale by signal averaging and/or spatial binning. The RF-QDM enables simultaneous imaging of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of narrowband magnetic field patterns at the micron-scale, with potential applications in real-space NMR imaging, AC susceptibility mapping, impedance tomography, analysis of electronic circuits, and spatial eddy-current-based inspection.</description>
