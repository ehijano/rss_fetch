      <title>A perturbed Alexander polynomial for singular knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a version of the Alexander polynomial for singular knots and tangles and show how it can be strengthened considerably by introducing a perturbation. For singular long knots, we also prove that our Alexander polynomial agrees with previous definitions.</description>

      <title>On integral rigidity in Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to prove integral rigidity results for the Seiberg-Witten invariants of a closed $4$-manifold $X$ containing a non-separating hypersurface $Y$ satisfying suitable (chain-level) Floer theoretic conditions. As a concrete application, we show that if $X$ has the homology of a four-torus, and it contains a non-separating three-torus, then the sum of all Seiberg-Witten invariants of $X$ is determined in purely cohomological terms. Our results can be interpreted as $(3+1)$-dimensional versions of Donaldson's TQFT approach to the formula of Meng-Taubes, and build upon a subtle interplay between irreducible solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations on $X$ and reducible ones on $Y$ and its complement. Along the way, we provide a concrete description of the associated graded map (for a suitable filtration) of the map on $\overline{HM}_*$ induced by a negative cobordism between three-manifolds, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Bi-Filtration and Stability of TDA Mapper for Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carlsson, Singh and Memoli's TDA mapper takes a point cloud dataset and outputs a graph that depends on several parameter choices. Dey, Memoli, and Wang developed Multiscale Mapper for abstract topological spaces so that parameter choices can be analyzed via persistent homology. However, when applied to actual data, one does not always obtain filtrations of mapper graphs. DBSCAN, one of the most common clustering algorithms used in the TDA mapper software, has two parameters, \textbf{$\epsilon$} and \textbf{MinPts}. If \textbf{MinPts = 1} then DBSCAN is equivalent to single linkage clustering with cutting height \textbf{$\epsilon$}. We show that if DBSCAN clustering is used with \textbf{MinPts $&gt;$ 2}, a filtration of mapper graphs may not exist except in the absence of free-border points; but such filtrations exist if DBSCAN clustering is used with \textbf{MinPts = 1} or \textbf{2} as the cover size increases, \textbf{$\epsilon$} increases, and/or \textbf{MinPts} decreases. However, the 1-dimensional filtration is unstable. If one adds noise to a data set so that each data point has been perturbed by a distance at most \textbf{$\delta$}, the persistent homology of the mapper graph of the perturbed data set can be significantly different from that of the original data set. We show that we can obtain stability by increasing both the cover size and \textbf{$\epsilon$} at the same time. In particular, we show that the bi-filtrations of the homology groups with respect to cover size and $\epsilon$ between these two datasets are \textbf{2$\delta$}-interleaved.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Geometric Group Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book provides a self-contained introduction to geometric group theory. The topics range from an introduction of Cayley and Schreier graphs to Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth and amenability. We discuss the ping-pong lemma, quasi-isometries, growth of groups, hyperbolicity, and other related notions. The book is based on graduate courses and can be used for such a course or for independent study.</description>

      <title>The homotopy type of the PL cobordism category. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.06236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a bordism category $\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ whose objects are bundles of closed $(d-1)$-dimensional piecewise linear manifolds and whose morphisms are bundles of $d$-dimensional piecewise linear cobordisms. In the main theorem of this article, we show that the classifying space $B\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ is weak homotopy equivalent to an infinite loop space. We regard $\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ as the piecewise linear analogue of the category of smooth cobordisms which has been studied extensively in connection to the Madsen-Weiss Theorem, and the main result of this paper is a first step towards obtaining Madsen-Weiss type results in the context of piecewise linear topology.</description>

      <title>The Klein quartic maximizes the multiplicity of the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Klein quartic maximizes the multiplicity of the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian among all closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $3$, with multiplicity equal to $8$. We also obtain partial results in genus $2$, where we find that the maximum multiplicity is between $3$ and $6$. Along the way, we show that for every $g\geq 2$, there exists some $\delta_g&gt;0$ such that the multiplicity of any eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a closed hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ in the interval $[0,1/4+\delta_g]$ is at most $2g-1$ despite the fact that this interval can contain arbitrarily many eigenvalues. This extends a result of Otal to a larger interval but with a weaker bound, which nevertheless improves upon the general upper bound of S\'evennec.</description>

      <title>Mutation, surface graphs, and alternating links in surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study alternating links in thickened surfaces in terms of the lattices of integer flows on their Tait graphs. We use this approach to give a short proof of the first two generalised Tait conjectures. We also prove that the flow lattice is an invariant of alternating links in thickened surfaces and is further invariant under disc mutation. For classical links, the flow lattice and $d$-invariants are complete invariants of the mutation class of an alternating link. For links in thickened surfaces, we show that this is no longer the case by finding a stronger mutation invariant, namely the Gordon-Litherland linking form. In particular, we find alternating knots in thickened surfaces which have isometric flow lattices but with non-isomorphic linking forms.</description>

      <title>Regular homotopy classes of links of simple singularities and immersions associated with their Dynkin diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our aim is to determine the regular homotopy classes of immersions related to Arnol'd's simple singularities. For every type of simple singularities, we determine the regular homotopy class of the inclusion map of the link into the 5-sphere. We further show that the inclusion map is regularly homotopic to the immersion associated with the corresponding Dynkin diagram, which was constructed by Kinjo. We prove these by computing the complete invariants of the immersions given by Wu and Saeki--Sz\H{u}cs--Takase. As an application, we also determine the Smale invariants of Kinjo's immersions.</description>

      <title>On the Kauffman bracket skein module of $(S^1 \times S^2) \ \# \ (S^1 \times S^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the structure of the Kauffman bracket skein module of all $3$-manifolds over the ring of Laurent polynomials $\mathbb Z[A^{\pm 1}]$ is a big open problem in skein theory. Very little is known about the skein module of non-prime manifolds over this ring. In this paper, we compute the Kauffman bracket skein module of the $3$-manifold $(S^1 \times S^2) \ \# \ (S^1 \times S^2)$ over the ring $\mathbb Z[A^{\pm 1}]$. We do this by analysing the submodule of handle sliding relations, for which we provide a suitable basis. Along the way we also compute the Kauffman bracket skein module of $(S^1 \times S^2) \ \# \ (S^1 \times D^2)$. Furthermore, we show that the skein module of $(S^1 \times S^2) \ \# \ (S^1 \times S^2)$ does not split into the sum of free and torsion submodules.</description>

      <title>The bounded cohomology of transformation groups of Euclidean spaces and discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the groups of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are boundedly acyclic, in all regularities. This is the first full computation of the bounded cohomology of a transformation group that is not compactly supported, and it implies that many characteristic classes of flat $\mathbb{R}^n$- and $S^n$-bundles are unbounded. We obtain the same result for the group of homeomorphisms of the disc that restrict to the identity on the boundary, and for the homeomorphism group of the non-compact Cantor set. In the appendix, Alexander Kupers proves a controlled version of the annulus theorem which we use to study the bounded cohomology of the homeomorphism group of the discs.</description>

      <title>Positive braids minimize ascending number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known algorithm for unknotting knots involves traversing a knot diagram and changing each crossing that is first encountered from below. The minimal number of crossings changed in this way across all diagrams for a knot is called the ascending number of the knot. The ascending number is bounded below by the unknotting number. We show that for knots obtained as the closure of a positive braid, the ascending number equals the unknotting number.
  We also present data indicating that a similar result may hold for positive knots. We use this data to examine which low-crossing knots have the property that their ascending number is realized in a minimal crossing diagram, showing that there are at most 5 hyperbolic, alternating knots with at most 12 crossings with this property.</description>

      <title>Spaces over BO are thickened manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the topologically enriched category of compact smooth manifolds (possibly with corners), with morphisms given by codimension zero smooth embeddings. Now formally identify any object X with its thickening X x [-1,1]. We prove that the resulting infinity-category of thickened smooth manifolds is equivalent to the infinity-category of finite spaces over BO. (This is one formalization of the philosophy that embedding questions become homotopy-theoretic upon passage to higher dimensions.) The central tool is a geometric construction of pushouts in this infinity-category, carried out with an eye toward proving analogous results in exact symplectic geometry. Notably, the proof never invokes smooth approximation nor any h-principle.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove the PL analogue of the theorem of Galatius, Madsen, Tillmann, and Weiss which describes the homotopy type of the smooth cobordism category. More specifically, we introduce the PL Madsen-Tillmann spectrum $\mathbf{MT}PL(d)$ and prove that there is a weak homotopy equivalence of the form $B\mathsf{Cob}^{\mathrm{PL}}_d \simeq \Omega^{\infty-1}\mathbf{MT}PL(d)$. We also discuss how to adjust the methods of this paper to obtain the topological version of our main result.</description>
