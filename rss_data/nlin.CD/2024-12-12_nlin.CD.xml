      <title>The Structure of the Route to the Period-three Orbit in the Collatz Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the Collatz map from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics. By expressing integers in terms of Sharkovsky's ordering, we show that it is sufficient to consider only odd initial values for analyzing the iterations. We introduce the concept of ``direction phases'' to classify the iterations into upward and downward phases, and define a recursive function family $F_s$ based on the number of upward phases. A logarithmic relationship between iteration time and initial values is established, demonstrating that the Collatz map converges to the period-three orbit after a finite number of iterations. We also identify attractor domains with power-law distributions and find that odd numbers classified by upward phases follow a Gamma distribution. Finally, we show that the Collatz map is equivalent to a shift map in binary, and that the ergodicity of the shift map ensures the Collatz map will inevitably evolve onto its attractors, providing theoretical support for the Collatz conjecture. This work offers valuable insights for the study of discrete dynamical systems and related problems in number theory.</description>

      <title>A note on the role of the initial error structure in the tropics on the seasonal-to-decadal forecasting skill in the extratropics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictability of a coupled system composed by a coupled reduced-order extratropical ocean-atmosphere model forced by a low-order 3-variable tropical recharge-discharge model, is explored with emphasis on the long term forecasting capabilities. Highly idealized ensemble forecasts are produced taking into account the uncertainties in the initial states of the system, with a specific attention to the structure of the initial errors in the tropical model. Three main types of experiments are explored with random perturbations along the three Lyapunov vectors of the tropical model, along the two dominant Lyapunov vectors, and along the first Lyapunov vector, only. When perturbations are introduced along all vectors, forecasting biases are developing even if in a perfect model framework. Theses biases are considerably reduced only when the perturbations are introduced along the dominant Lyapunov vector. This perturbation strategy allows furthermore for getting a reduced mean square error at long lead times of a few years, and to get reliable ensemble forecasts on the whole time range. These very counterintuitive findings further underline the importance of appropriately control the initial error structure in the tropics through data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics in circular and deformed bilayer graphene inspired billiards with anisotropy and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While billiard systems of various shapes have been used as paradigmatic model systems in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and quantum chaos, few studies have investigated anisotropic billiards. Motivated by the tremendous advances in using and controlling electronic and optical mesoscopic systems with bilayer graphene representing an easily accessible anisotropic material for electrons when trigonal warping is present, we investigate billiards of various anisotropies and geometries using a trajectory tracing approach founded in the concept of ray-wave correspondence. We find that the presence of anisotropy can render the billiards' dynamics dramatically from its isotropic counterpart. It may induce chaotic and mixed dynamics in otherwise integrable systems, and may stabilize originally unstable trajectories. We characterize the dynamics of anisotropic billiards in real and phase space using Lyapunov exponents and the Poincar\'e surface of section as phase space representation.</description>
