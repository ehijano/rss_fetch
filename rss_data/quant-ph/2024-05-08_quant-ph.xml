      <title>Limits to velocity of signal propagation in many-body systems: a quantum-information perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) states that the range and strength of interactions between the constituents of a complex many-body system impose upper limits to how fast the signal can propagate. It manifests in a light cone-like growth of correlation function connecting two distant subsystems. Here we employ the techniques of quantum information to demonstrate that the LRB can be determined from local measurements performed on a single qubit that is connected to a many-body system. This formulation provides an operational recipe for estimating the LRB in complex systems, replacing the measurement of the correlation function with simple single-particle manipulations. We demonstrate the potency of this approach by deriving the upper limit to the speed of signal propagation in the XY spin chain.</description>

      <title>Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms in Practice: Application to Ground-State Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the practicality of early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, focusing on ground-state energy estimation problems. Specifically, we address the computation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the spectral measure of the Hamiltonian and the identification of its discontinuities. Scaling to bigger system sizes unveils three challenges: the smoothness of the CDF for large supports, the absence of tight lower bounds on the overlap with the actual ground state, and the complexity of preparing high-quality initial states. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a signal processing technique for identifying the inflection point of the CDF. We argue that this change of paradigm significantly simplifies the problem, making it more accessible while still being accurate. Hence, instead of trying to find the exact ground-state energy, we advocate improving on the classical estimate by aiming at the low-energy support of the initial state. Furthermore, we offer quantitative resource estimates for the maximum number of samples required to identify an increase in the CDF of a given size. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on a 26-qubit fully-connected Heisenberg model using a truncated density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) initial state of low bond dimension. Results show that the prediction obtained with the quantum algorithm aligns well with the DMRG-converged energy at large bond dimensions and requires several orders of magnitude fewer samples than predicted by the theory. Hence, we argue that CDF-based quantum algorithms are a viable, practical alternative to quantum phase estimation in resource-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mitigating errors in logical qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting codes protect quantum information, allowing for large quantum computations provided that physical error rates are sufficiently low. We combine post-selection with surface code error correction through the use of a parameterized family of exclusive decoders, which are able to abort on decoding instances that are deemed too difficult. We develop new numerical sampling methods to quantify logical failure rates with exclusive decoders as well as the trade-off in terms of the amount of post-selection required. For the most discriminating of exclusive decoders, we demonstrate a threshold of 50\% under depolarizing noise for the surface code (or $32(1)\%$ for the fault-tolerant case with phenomenological measurement errors), and up to a quadratic improvement in logical failure rates below threshold. Furthermore, surprisingly, with a modest exclusion criterion, we identify a regime at low error rates where the exclusion rate decays with code distance, providing a pathway for scalable and time-efficient quantum computing with post-selection. We apply our exclusive decoder to the 15-to-1 magic state distillation protocol, and report a $75\%$ reduction in the number of physical qubits required, and a $60\%$ reduction in the total spacetime volume required, including accounting for repetitions required for post-selection. We also consider other applications, as an error mitigation technique, and in concatenated schemes. Our work highlights the importance of post-selection as a powerful tool in quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal decoding algorithm for color codes using Population Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development and use of large-scale quantum computers relies on integrating quantum error-correcting (QEC) schemes into the quantum computing pipeline. A fundamental part of the QEC protocol is the decoding of the syndrome to identify a recovery operation with a high success rate. In this work, we implement a decoder that finds the recovery operation with the highest success probability by mapping the decoding problem to a spin system and using Population Annealing to estimate the free energy of the different error classes. We study the decoder performance on a 4.8.8 color code lattice under different noise models, including code capacity with bit-flip and depolarizing noise, and phenomenological noise, which considers noisy measurements, with performance reaching near-optimal thresholds. This decoding algorithm can be applied to a wide variety of stabilizer codes, including surface codes and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>Two Toy Spin Chain Models of Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve for the decoherence dynamics of two models in which a simple qubit or Central Spin couples to a bath of spins; the bath is made from a chain of spins. In model 1, the bath spins are Ising spins; in Model 2, they are coupled by transverse spin-spin interactions, and the chain supports spin waves. We look at (i) the case where the Hamiltonian is static, with a constant system/bath coupling, and (ii) where this coupling varies in time.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Computations That Capture Strict Variationality, Volume Law Behavior, and the Efficient Representation of Neural Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <title>EPOC: A Novel Pulse Generation Framework Incorporating Advanced Synthesis Techniques for Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose EPOC, an efficient pulse generation framework for quantum circuits that combines ZX-Calculus, circuit partitioning, and circuit synthesis to accelerate pulse generation. Unlike previous works that focus on generating pulses from unitary matrices without exploring equivalent representations, EPOC employs a finer granularity approach by grouping quantum gates and decomposing the resulting unitary matrices into smaller ones using synthesis techniques. This enables increased parallelism and decreased latency in quantum pulses. EPOC also continuously optimizes the circuit by identifying equivalent representations, leading to further reductions in circuit latency while minimizing the computational overhead associated with quantum optimal control. We introduce circuit synthesis into the workflow of quantum optimal control for the first time and achieve a 31.74% reduction in latency compared to previous work and a 76.80% reduction compared to the gate-based method for creating pulses. The approach demonstrates the potential for significant performance improvements in quantum circuits while minimizing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Bipartite OTOC in open quantum systems: information scrambling and irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of information scrambling has seen significant growth over the last decade, where the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a prominent tool to probe it. In this work, we use bipartite OTOC, a particular form of OTOC, to study information scrambling in the atom-field interaction models and the model of the Ising spin chain interacting with a tilted magnetic field. This is done considering the effects of open quantum systems. A relationship between information scrambling, using bipartite OTOC, and irreversibility, using entropy production, is probed under unitary dynamics. The equivalence of bipartite OTOC with operator entanglement is explicitly shown for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Further Applications of the Generalised Phase Kick-Back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we defined a quantum algorithmic technique known as the Generalised Phase Kick-Back, or $GPK$, and analysed its applications in generalising some classical quantum problems, such as the Deutsch-Jozsa problem or the Bernstein-Vazirani problem. We also proved that using this technique we can solve Simon's problem in a more efficient manner. In this paper we continue analysing the potential of this technique, defining the concept of $\mathbf{y}$-balanced functions and solving a new problem, which further generalises the generalised Deutsch-Jozsa problem (the fully balanced image problem). This problem also underlines the relation between quantum computation and Boolean function theory, and, in particular, the Walsh and Fourier-Hadamard transforms. We finish our discussion by solving the generalised version of Simon's problem using the $GPK$ algorithm, while analysing the efficiency of this new solution.</description>

      <title>Non-projective Bell state measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bell state measurement (BSM) is the projection of two qubits onto four orthogonal maximally entangled states. Here, we first propose how to appropriately define more general BSMs, that have more than four possible outcomes, and then study whether they exist in quantum theory. We observe that non-projective BSMs can be defined in a systematic way in terms of equiangular tight frames of maximally entangled states, i.e.~a set of maximally entangled states, where every pair is equally, and in a sense maximally, distinguishable. We show that there exists a five-outcome BSM through an explicit construction, and find that it admits a simple geometric representation. Then, we prove that there exists no larger BSM on two qubits by showing that no six-outcome BSM is possible. We also determine the most distinguishable set of six equiangular maximally entangled states and show that it falls only somewhat short of forming a valid quantum measurement. Finally, we study the non-projective BSM in the contexts of both local state discrimination and entanglement-assisted quantum communication. Our results put forward natural forms of non-projective joint measurements and provide insight on the geometry of entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Artificial Quantum Thermal State Generation using Encoded Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum steganography is a powerful method for information security where communications between a sender and receiver are disguised as naturally occurring noise in a channel. We encoded the phase and amplitude of weak coherent laser states such that a third party monitoring the communications channel, measuring the flow of optical states through the channel, would see an amalgamation of states indistinguishable from thermal noise light. Using quantum state tomography, we experimentally reconstructed the density matrices for artificially engineered thermal states and spontaneous emission from an optical amplifier and verified a state fidelity F&gt;0.98 when compared with theoretical thermal states.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing in the fractional Fourier domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain quantum sensing protocols rely on qubits that are initialized, coherently driven in the presence of a stimulus to be measured, then read out. Most widely employed pulse sequences used to drive sensing qubits act locally in either the time or frequency domain. We introduce a generalized set of sequences that effect a measurement in any fractional Fourier domain, i.e. along a linear trajectory of arbitrary angle through the time-frequency plane. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers we experimentally demonstrate advantages in sensing signals with time-varying spectra.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Array Filtering of Resonance Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel frequency-filtering method for measuring and calculating frequency-filtered photon-correlations. This novel method is a cavity-based system we call the multi-mode array filter, which consists of an array of tunable single-mode cavities that are equally spaced in frequency. By introducing a mode-dependent phase modulation, we produce a near rectangular frequency response, allowing us to increase the filter bandwidth -- and thus the temporal response -- without sacrificing frequency isolation. We model the frequency filtering using a cascaded quantum open systems approach which completely neglects any back-action of the filter onto the source system. This allows us to derive a closed set of operator moment equations for source and filter system operators, thus providing an extremely efficient method to calculate frequency-filtered first- and second-order correlation functions. We demonstrate this novel filtering method by applying it to a resonantly driven two-level atom. We present examples of frequency-filtered power spectra to demonstrate the improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter over the single-mode filter. We then present results for the single-mode and multi-mode-array filtered second-order auto- and cross-correlation functions. These are compared against expressions derived in the secular approximation. The improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter allows us to investigate new regimes of frequency-filtered photon correlations, such as two-photon leapfrog processes, and the effect of vanishing bandwidth on filtered auto-correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement swapping via lossy channels using photon-number-encoded states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement shared between distant parties is a key resource in quantum networks. However, photon losses in quantum channels significantly reduce the success probability of entanglement sharing, which scales quadratically with the channel transmission. Quantum repeaters using entanglement swapping can mitigate this effect, but usually require high-performance photonic quantum memories to synchronize photonic qubits. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally investigate an entanglement swapping protocol using photon-number-encoded states that can effectively alleviate quantum channel losses without requiring photonic quantum memories. We demonstrate that the protocol exhibits a success probability scaling linearly with the channel transmission. Furthermore, we show that while unbalanced channel losses can degrade the shared entanglement, this effect can be compensated by optimally adjusting the initial entangled states. Our results highlight the potential of photon-number encoding for realizing robust entanglement distribution in lossy quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a software library for the commutation of Pauli operators through quantum Clifford circuits, which is called Pauli tracking. Tracking Pauli operators allows one to reduce the number of Pauli gates that must be executed on quantum hardware. This is relevant for measurement-based quantum computing and for error-corrected circuits that are implemented through Clifford circuits. Furthermore, we investigate the problem of qubit scheduling in measurement-based quantum computing and how Pauli tracking can be used to capture the constraints on the order of measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Unpredictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpredictable functions (UPFs) play essential roles in classical cryptography, including message authentication codes (MACs) and digital signatures. In this paper, we introduce a quantum analog of UPFs, which we call unpredictable state generators (UPSGs). UPSGs are implied by pseudorandom function-like states generators (PRFSs), which are a quantum analog of pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and therefore UPSGs could exist even if one-way functions do not exist, similar to other recently introduced primitives like pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs), one-way state generators (OWSGs), and EFIs. In classical cryptography, UPFs are equivalent to PRFs, but in the quantum case, the equivalence is not clear, and UPSGs could be weaker than PRFSs. Despite this, we demonstrate that all known applications of PRFSs are also achievable with UPSGs. They include IND-CPA-secure secret-key encryption and EUF-CMA-secure MACs with unclonable tags. Our findings suggest that, for many applications, quantum unpredictability, rather than quantum pseudorandomness, is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Protecting quantum gates from arbitrary single- and two-qubit errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the protection of quantum gates from arbitrary single- and two-qubit noises with properly designed dynamical decoupling pulses. The proposed dynamical decoupling method is a concatenation of a sequence of pulses formed by $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_x\sigma_x$ with another sequence constructed by $\sigma_z$, $\sigma_z\sigma_z$. The concatenation of the two sequences results in desired pulses to fight agianst any single- and two-qubit errors. The success of our method relies on the ability to adjust system parameters or interaction terms, which can be achieved in different physical systems, including trapped ions and superconducting qubits. We finally explore the performance of our method numerically with the above-mentioned errors that are changing at any moment and show the preferred protection offered by the method. Therefore, our method is a timely step forward in preserving quantum gates at the level of physical qubits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We characterise each module individually and show (i) a gain over 35 dB, a bandwidth of 118 MHz, a minimum noise temperature of 4.2 K, (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1 dB, a noise temperature smaller than 1.1 K across 0-2 GHz, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all elements into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel approach to perform the simulation of a single qubit quantum algorithm using laser beams. Leveraging the polarization states of photonic qubits, and inspired by variational quantum eigensolvers, we develop a variational quantum algorithm implementing a clustering procedure following the approach proposed by some of us in SciRep 13, 13284 (2023). A key aspect of our research involves the utilization of non-orthogonal states within the photonic domain, harnessing the potential of polarization schemes to reproduce unitary circuits. By mapping these non-orthogonal states into polarization states, we achieve an efficient and versatile quantum information processing unit which serves as a clustering device for a diverse set of datasets.</description>

      <title>On High-Dimensional Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a QKD protocol that uses single-photon interference to perform QKD over long distances. QKD protocols that encode information using high-dimensional quantum states can benefit from increased key rates and higher noise resilience. We define the essence of Twin-Field QKD and explore its generalization to higher dimensions. Further, we show that, ultimately, the Twin-Field protocol cannot be generalized to higher dimensions in accordance with our definition.</description>

      <title>Quantum unital Otto heat engines: using Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-probability for the engine's coherence to stay alive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider \textit{quantum unital Otto heat engines}. The latter refers to the fact that both the unitaries of the adiabatic strokes and the source of the heat provided to the engine preserve the maximally mixed state. We show how to compute the cumulants of either the dephased or undephased engine. For a qubit, we give the analytical expressions of the averages and variances for arbitrary unitaries and unital channels. We do a detailed comparative study between the dephased and undephased heat engines. More precisely, we focus on the effect of the parameters on the average work and its reliability and efficiency. As a case study of unital channels, we consider a quantum projective measurement. We show on which basis we should projectively measure the qubit, either the dephased or undephased heat engine, to extract higher amounts of work, increase the latter's reliability, and increase efficiency. Further, we show that non-adiabatic transitions \textit{are not always detrimental} to thermodynamic quantities. Our results, we believe, are important for heat engines fueled by \textit{quantum measurement}.</description>

      <title>Improving semi-device-independent randomness certification by entropy accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certified randomness guaranteed to be unpredictable by adversaries is central to information security. The fundamental randomness inherent in quantum physics makes certification possible from devices that are only weakly characterised, i.e. requiring little trust in their implementation. It was recently shown that the amount of certifiable randomness can be greatly improved using the so-called Entropy Accumulation Theorem generalised to prepare-and-measure settings. Furthermore, this approach allows a finite-size analysis which avoids assuming that all rounds are independent and identically distributed. Here, we demonstrate this improvement in semi-device-independent randomness certification from untrusted measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo for systems larger than your Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers theoretically promise computational advantage in many tasks, but it is much less clear how such advantage can be maintained when using existing and near-term hardware that has limitations in the number and quality of its qubits. One promising application was proposed in Layden et al [Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] where a method to reduce the thermalisation time required when sampling from hard probability distribution was introduced as a Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) approach. In [Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] the size of the required quantum computer scales linearly with the problem, putting limitations on the sizes of systems that one can consider. In this work we introduce a framework to coarse grain the algorithm in such a way that the quantum computation can be performed using, multiple times, smaller quantum computers and we term the method the Coarse Grained Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CGQeMCMC). Example strategies within this framework are put to the test, with the quantum speedup of [Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] persisting while using only $\sqrt{n}$ simulated qubits where $n$ is the number of qubits required in the original QeMCMC -- a quadratic reduction in resources. The coarse graining framework has the potential to be practically applicable in the near term as it requires very few qubits to approach classically intractable problem instances, here only 6 simulated qubits suffice to gain advantage compared to standard classical approaches when investigating the magnetisation of a 36 spin system. Our method is also adjustable to quantum hardware specifications, and it appears that it can be easily combined with other techniques both classical and quantum.</description>

      <title>Progressive Quantum Algorithm for Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Hadfield has proposed a novel Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+) to tackle Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems (CCOPs), and it has wide applications. However, the large requirement of multi-qubit controlled gates in QAOA+ limits its applications in solving larger-scale CCOPs. To mitigate the resources overhead of QAOA+, we introduce an approach termed Progressive Quantum Algorithm (PQA). In this paper, the concept and performance of PQA are introduced focusing on the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem. PQA aims to yield the solution of the target graph $G$ with fewer resources by solving the MIS problem on a desired derived subgraph that has the same MIS solution as $G$ but has a much smaller graph size. To construct such a desired subgraph, PQA gradually and regularly expands the graph size starting from a well-designed initial subgraph. After each expansion, PQA solves the MIS problem on the current subgraph using QAOA+ and estimates whether the current graph has the same MIS solution as the target graph. PQA repeats the graph expansion and solving process until reaching the stop condition. In our simulations, the performance of PQA is benchmarked on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) and regular graphs. The simulation results suggest that PQA showcases higher average approximation ratio (AAR) and significant quantum resource savings compared with directly solves the original problem using QAOA+ (DS-QAOA+) at the same level depth $p$. Remarkably, the AAR obtained by PQA is $12.9305\%$ ($4.8645\%$) higher than DS-QAOA+ on ER (regular) graphs, and the average number of multi-qubit gates (qubits) consumed by PQA is 1/3 (1/2) of that of DS-QAOA+. The remarkable efficiency of PQA makes it possible to solve larger-scale CCOPs on the current quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental implementation of a polarization-entangled photon pair source based on beam displacers. The down-converted photons are emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a non-degenerate and type-0 process. We obtain a state fidelity of F=0.975$\pm$0.004 and violate a Clauser-Horne Shimony-Holt inequality with S=2.75$\pm$0.01. Our source also uses thin crystals for applications in quantum imaging, taking advantage of the large number of spatial modes. With this configuration, we obtain 550$\pm$12 spatial modes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit for Imputation of Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imputation of missing data is a common procedure in data analysis that consists in predicting missing values of incomplete data points. In this work we analyse a variational quantum circuit for the imputation of missing data. We construct variational quantum circuits with gates complexity $O(N)$ and $O(N^2)$ that return the last missing bit of a binary string for a specific distribution. We train and test the performance of the algorithms on a series of datasets finding good convergence of the results. Finally, we test the circuit for generalization to unseen data. For simple systems, we are able to describe the circuit analytically, making possible to skip the tedious and unresolved problem of training the circuit with repetitive measurements. We find beforehand the optimal values of the parameters and we make use of them to construct an optimal circuit suited to the generation of truly random data.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation experiments with style-based quantum generative adversarial networks on trapped-ion and superconducting-qubit technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current noisy intermediate scale quantum computing era, and after the significant progress of the quantum hardware we have seen in the past few years, it is of high importance to understand how different quantum algorithms behave on different types of hardware. This includes whether or not they can be implemented at all and, if so, what the quality of the results is. This work quantitatively demonstrates, for the first time, how the quantum generator architecture for the style-based quantum generative adversarial network (qGAN) can not only be implemented but also yield good results on two very different types of hardware for data augmentation: the IBM bm_torino quantum computer based on the Heron chip using superconducting transmon qubits and the aria-1 IonQ quantum computer based on trapped-ion qubits. The style-based qGAN, proposed in 2022, generalizes the state of the art for qGANs and allows for shallow-depth networks. The results obtained on both devices are of comparable quality, with the aria-1 device delivering somewhat more accurate results than the ibm_torino device, while the runtime on ibm_torino is significantly shorter than on aria-1. Parallelization of the circuits, using up to 48 qubits on IBM quantum systems and up to 24 qubits on the IonQ system, is also presented, reducing the number of submitted jobs and allowing for a substantial reduction of the runtime on the quantum processor to generate the total number of samples.</description>

      <title>100 Gbps Quantum-safe IPsec VPN Tunnels over 46 km Deployed Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated for the first time quantum-safe high-speed 100 Gbps site-to-site IPsec tunnels secured using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology. The demonstration was conducted between two JPMorgan Chase Data Centers (DCs) in an air-gapped environment over 46 km of deployed telecom fiber across Singapore achieving 45 days of continuous operation. Two different Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel configurations were tested: (1) a QKD-secured VPN tunnel configuration with a maximum throughput of 80 Gbps and (2) a multi-VPN tunnel configuration exhibiting 12 QKD-secured VPN tunnels with a throughput of 8.39 Gbps per tunnel resulting in an aggregated throughput of 99.62 Gbps for all tunnels. For the QKD system performance, we achieved an average Secret Key Rate (SKR) of 7.4 kbps (about 29 AES-256 keys per second), an average Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) of 0.8% and an average visibility of 98.6%. We utilized the ETSI-QKD-014 REST-based Application Programming Interface (API) to exchange the QKD generated keys between the key management server in the QKD system and the next-generation firewalls in order to encrypt and decrypt the data. The data was encrypted by the quantum-safe keys using the AES-256-GCM cipher suite with a key refresh rate of 120 seconds without affecting the VPN tunnel connectivity and performance</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres--Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators which have the same polynomial factor. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.
  We also prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of long-range stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in the dual-unitary XXZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems can not be efficiently simulated classically due to the presence of entanglement and nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic. Here we study the generation of magic under evolution by a quantum circuit. To be able to provide exact solutions, we focus on the dual-unitary XXZ model and a measure of magic called stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Moreover, we focus also on long-range SRE, which cannot be removed by short-depth quantum circuits. To obtain exact solutions we use a ZX-calculus representation and graphical rules for the evaluation of the required expressions. We obtain exact results for SRE after short-time evolution in the thermodynamic limit and for long-range SRE for all times and all R\'enyi parameters for a particular partition of the state. Since the numerical evaluation of these quantities is exponentially costly in the R\'enyi parameter, we verify this numerically for low R\'enyi parameters and accessible system sizes and provide numerical results for the long-range SRE in other bipartitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious transfer between two untrusting parties is an important primitive in cryptography. There are different variants of oblivious transfer. In Rabin oblivious transfer, the sender Alice holds a bit, and the receiver Bob either obtains the bit, or obtains no information with probability $p_?$. Alice should not know whether or not Bob obtained the bit. We examine a quantum Rabin oblivious transfer protocol that uses two pure states. Investigating different cheating scenarios for the sender and for the receiver, we determine optimal cheating probabilities in each case. Comparing the quantum Rabin oblivious transfer protocol to classical Rabin oblivious transfer protocols, we show that the quantum protocol outperforms classical protocols which do not use a third party, for some values of $p_?$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postulating the identification of $\psi^*(x, t) \psi(x,t)$ with a physical probability density is unsatisfactory conceptually and overly limited practically. For electrons, there is a simple, calculable relativistic correction proportional to $\nabla \psi^* \cdot \nabla \psi$. In particular, zeroes of the wave function do not indicate vanishing probability density of presence. Effects of this kind arise generically in Lagrangian-based theories implementing the particle concept.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Optimizers for Qumode State Preparation with Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation involves preparing a target state from an initial system, a process integral to applications such as quantum machine learning and solving systems of linear equations. Recently, there has been a growing interest in qumodes due to advancements in the field and their potential applications. However there is a notable gap in the literature specifically addressing this area. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing performance benchmarks of various optimizers used in state preparation with Variational Quantum Algorithms. We conducted extensive testing across multiple scenarios, including different target states, both ideal and sampling simulations, and varying numbers of basis gate layers. Our evaluations offer insights into the complexity of learning each type of target state and demonstrate that some optimizers perform better than others in this context. Notably, the Powell optimizer was found to be exceptionally robust against sampling errors, making it a preferred choice in scenarios prone to such inaccuracies. Additionally, the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation optimizer was distinguished for its efficiency and ability to handle increased parameter dimensionality effectively.</description>

      <title>Large mechanical squeezing through synthetic magnetism in optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate large amount of mechanical squeezing, far beyond the $\rm{3dB}$ limit, which is based on synthetic magnetism in optomechanical system that hosts a Backward Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (BSBS) process. Our benckmark system consists of an acoustic mode coupled to two optical modes through the BSBS process, and a Duffing mechanical oscillator that couples to the same optical modes through the standard optomechanical radiation pressure. The synthetic magnetism comes from the modulation of the mechanical coupling between the acoustic and the mechanical modes. When there is no synthetic magnetism, a given amount of mechanical squeezing is generated in the system. This squeezing is mainly dependent on the BSBS process, and it is fragile against thermal noise. By switching on the synthetic magnetism, the degree of the generated squeezing is greatly enhanced and goes far beyond the limit of the $\rm{3dB}$. This large magnetism induced squeezing persists even when there is no BSBS process in the system. Moreover, this generated squeezing is robust enough against thermal noise in comparison to the one induced when the synthetic magnetism is off. Furthermore, both the mechanical variance squeezing and effective phonon number exhibit series of peaks and dips depending on the phase modulation of the mechanical coupling. This oscillatory feature is reminscent of a sudden death and revival of squeezing phenomenon, which can be used to maintain a desired magnitude of squeezing by tuning this phase. Our proposal provides a path toward a flexible scheme that generates large amount of squeezing, far beyond the $\rm{3dB}$ limit. Such a generated squeezed states can be use for quantum applications including quantum information processing, quantum sensing and metrology, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Scalable Circuit Cutting and Scheduling in a Resource-constrained and Distributed Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite quantum computing's rapid development, current systems remain limited in practical applications due to their limited qubit count and quality. Various technologies, such as superconducting, trapped ions, and neutral atom quantum computing technologies are progressing towards a fault tolerant era, however they all face a diverse set of challenges in scalability and control. Recent efforts have focused on multi-node quantum systems that connect multiple smaller quantum devices to execute larger circuits. Future demonstrations hope to use quantum channels to couple systems, however current demonstrations can leverage classical communication with circuit cutting techniques. This involves cutting large circuits into smaller subcircuits and reconstructing them post-execution. However, existing cutting methods are hindered by lengthy search times as the number of qubits and gates increases. Additionally, they often fail to effectively utilize the resources of various worker configurations in a multi-node system. To address these challenges, we introduce FitCut, a novel approach that transforms quantum circuits into weighted graphs and utilizes a community-based, bottom-up approach to cut circuits according to resource constraints, e.g., qubit counts, on each worker. FitCut also includes a scheduling algorithm that optimizes resource utilization across workers. Implemented with Qiskit and evaluated extensively, FitCut significantly outperforms the Qiskit Circuit Knitting Toolbox, reducing time costs by factors ranging from 3 to 2000 and improving resource utilization rates by up to 3.88 times on the worker side, achieving a system-wide improvement of 2.86 times.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanical tunneling through multiple quantum barriers is a long-standing and well-known problem. Three methods proposed earlier to calculate the tunneling probabilities and energy splitting: (1). Instanton Method (2) WKb Approximation (3) Numerical Calculation.Instaton method is helpful to understand the physical insight of quantum tunneling but the validity is restricted to the case of large separation between the two potential minima. WKB approximation is widely used in its simple mathematical form, but the result is inaccurate due to its inherent defect in connection formula. Recently WKB approximation has been developed by changing the phase lose at the classical turning points but no above approximation have provide the perfect result to the best of knowledge of Author. Using numerical methods, one can get the solution up to the desired accuracy, but a considerable deal of physical insight is lost in this process. In this paper, the Author presented the developmentof models of multiple quantum wells or barriers potential by using analytical Transfer matrix method (TMM), which has been applied to any arbitrary potential wells and barriers successfully. The author applied the above theory to three electronic device models and got satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Computational ghost imaging with hybrid transforms by integrating Hadamard, discrete cosine, and Haar matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scenario of ghost imaging with hybrid transform approach is proposed by integrating Hadamard, discrete cosine, and Haar matrices. The measurement matrix is formed by the Kronecker product of the two different transform matrices. The image information can be conveniently reconstructed by the corresponding inverse matrices. In experiment, six hybridization sets are performed in computational ghost imaging. For an object of staggered stripes, only one bucket signal survives in the Hadamard-cosine, Haar-Hadamard, and Haar-cosine hybridization sets, demonstrating flexible image compression. For a handmade windmill object, the quality factors of the reconstructed images vary with the hybridization sets. Sub-Nyquist sampling can be applied to either or both of the different transform matrices in each hybridization set in experiment. The hybridization method can be extended to apply more transforms at once. Ghost imaging with hybrid transforms may find flexible applications in image processing, such as image compression and image encryption.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk skin modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy in (2 + 1)-Dimensional Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dependence of vacuum energy on the boundary conditions for massive scalar fields in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes. We consider the simplest geometrical setup given by a two-dimensional space bounded by two homogeneous parallel wires in order to compare it with the non-perturbative behaviour of the Casimir energy for non-Abelian gauge theories in (2 + 1) dimensions. Our results show the existence of two types of boundary conditions which give rise to two different asymptotic exponential decay regimes of the Casimir energy at large distances. The two families are distinguished by the feature that the boundary conditions involve or not interrelations between the behaviour of the fields at the two boundaries. Non-perturbative numerical simulations and analytical arguments show such an exponential decay for Dirichlet boundary conditions of SU(2) gauge theories. The verification that this behaviour is modified for other types of boundary conditions requires further numerical work. Subdominant corrections in the low-temperature regime are very relevant for numerical simulations, and they are also analysed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine lossless, phase-only transformations with fully-transmitting linear-optical scatterers to define the principle of linear-optical phase amplification. This enables a physical phase shift $\phi$ to be nonlinearly mapped to a new space $\gamma(\phi)$ using linear optics, resulting in a completely general and enhanced phase shifter that can replace any standard one. A particular phase amplifier is experimentally realized, allowing the phase enhancement parameter $d\gamma/d\phi$ to be continuously tuned. Placing this enhanced phase shifter in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer led to an intensity-phase slope more than twenty times steeper than what can be obtained with its unamplified counterpart.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between thermodynamics, general relativity and quantum mechanics has long intrigued researchers. Recently, important advances have been obtained in thermodynamics, mainly regarding its application to the quantum domain through fluctuation theorems. In this letter, we apply Fermi normal coordinates to report a fully general relativistic detailed quantum fluctuation theorem based on the two point measurement scheme. We demonstrate how the spacetime curvature can produce entropy in a localized quantum system moving in a general spacetime. The example of a quantum harmonic oscillator living in an expanding universe is presented. This result implies that entropy production is strongly observer dependent and deeply connects the arrow of time with the causal structure of the spacetime.</description>

      <title>A Thin Film Lithium Niobate Near-Infrared Platform for Multiplexing Quantum Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical quantum networks will require quantum nodes consisting of many memory qubits. This in turn will increase the complexity of the photonic circuits needed to control each qubit and will require strategies to multiplex memories and overcome the inhomogeneous distribution of their transition frequencies. Integrated photonics operating at visible to near-infrared (VNIR) wavelength range, compatible with the transition frequencies of leading quantum memory systems, can provide solutions to these needs. In this work, we realize a VNIR thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) integrated photonics platform with the key components to meet these requirements. These include low-loss couplers ($&lt;$ 1 dB/facet), switches ($&gt;$ 20 dB extinction), and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators ($&gt;$ 50 GHz). With these devices we demonstrate high-efficiency and CW-compatible frequency shifting ($&gt;$ 50 $\%$ efficiency at 15 GHz), as well as simultaneous laser amplitude and frequency control through a nested modulator structure. Finally, we highlight an architecture for multiplexing quantum memories using the demonstrated TFLN components, and outline how this platform can enable a 2-order of magnitude improvement in entanglement rates over single memory nodes. Our results demonstrate that TFLN can meet the necessary performance and scalability benchmarks to enable large-scale quantum nodes.</description>

      <title>Maxwell relation between entropy and atom-atom pair correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many-particle systems with short range interactions the local (same point) particle-particle pair correlation function represents a thermodynamic quantity that can be calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Here we exploit this property to derive a thermodynamic Maxwell relation between the local pair correlation and the entropy of an ultracold Bose gas in one dimension (1D). To demonstrate the utility of this Maxwell relation, we apply it to the computational formalism of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevski equation (SPGPE) to determine the entropy of a finite-temperature 1D Bose gas from its atom-atom pair correlation function. Such a correlation function is easy to compute numerically within the SPGPE and other formalisms, which is unlike computing the entropy itself. Our calculations can be viewed as a numerical experiment that serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of an experimental method to deduce the entropy of a quantum gas from the measured atom-atom correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescent atomic defects, especially in dielectric materials, such as diamond are quite promising for several emerging quantum applications. However, efficient light extraction, directional emission, and narrow spectral emission are key challenges. We have designed dielectric metasurface exploiting Mie-resonance and the Kerker condition to address these issues. Our designed diamond metasurface, tailored for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers in diamond, predicts up to 500x improvement in the collection of 637 nm (zero phonon line) photons over that from the bare diamond. Our design achieves highly directional emission, predominantly emitting in a 20 degree lobe in the forward direction. This makes light collection more efficient, including for fiber-based collection. The predicted results are stable against the position of the emitter placed in the metaelement, thus alleviating the challenging fabrication requirement of precise positioning of the defect center. Equally importantly, our design approach can be applied to enhance single photon emission also from other defects such as SiV, other materials such as hBN, and other sources such as quantum dots.</description>

In the setup, the laser cooled $^{87}Rb$ atoms are launched vertically up in the fountain geometry and Doppler sensitive two-photon Raman pulse atom interferometry is applied to detect the gravitational acceleration experienced by the atoms. Using our gravimeter setup, we have measured the local value of 'g' in our laboratory with sensitivity of 621 $\mu$Gal for integration time of 1350 s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show theoretically that the noise due to laser induced backaction acting on a small nanosphere levitated in a standing-wave trap can be considerably reduced by utilising a suitable reflective boundary. We examine the spherical mirror geometry as a case study of this backaction suppression effect, discussing the theoretical and experimental constraints. We study the effects of laser recoil directly, by analysing optical force fluctuations acting on a dipolar particle trapped at the centre of a spherical mirror. We also compute the corresponding measurement imprecision in an interferometric, shot-noise-limited position measurement, using the formalism of Fisher information flow. Our results show that the standing-wave trapping field is necessary for backaction suppression in three dimensions, and they satisfy the Heisenberg limit of detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the performance of threshold detectors based on Al Josephson junctions can be significantly improved by exploiting the phase diffusion regime. When the escape dynamics of the detector switches to this regime, a decrease in both - dark count rate and the standard deviation of switching current is simultaneously observed. However, this effect is essential for (i) critical currents below 100 nA, and (ii) temperatures of the order of several hundreds millikelvin. Importantly that for such detectors optimal performance occurs at finite temperatures, making the microwave single photon detection feasible even in the sub-K range. Possible explanation of these findings is discussed.</description>

      <title>Multiple crossing during dynamical symmetry restoration and implications for the quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local relaxation after a quench in 1-D quantum many-body systems is a well known and very active problem with rich phenomenology. Except for pathological cases, the local relaxation is accompanied by the local restoration of the symmetries broken by the initial state that are preserved by the unitary evolution. Recently, the entanglement asymmetry has been introduced as a probe to study the interplay between symmetry breaking and relaxation in an extended quantum system. In particular, using the asymmetry, it has been shown that the more a symmetry is initially broken, the faster it may be restored. This surprising effect, which has been also observed in trapped-ion experiments, can be seen as a quantum version of the Mpemba effect and is manifested by the crossing at a finite time of the entanglement asymmetry curves of two different initial symmetry breaking configurations. In this paper we show, how, by tuning the initial state, the symmetry dynamics in free fermionic systems can display much richer behaviour than seen previously. In particular, for certain classes of initial states, including ground states of free fermionic models with long-range couplings, the entanglement asymmetry can exhibit multiple crossings. This illustrates that the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect can only be inferred by examining the late time behaviour of the entanglement asymmetry.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, the rapid advancement of deep learning and big data applications has been driven by vast datasets and high-performance computing systems. However, as we approach the physical limits of semiconductor fabrication in the post-Moore's Law era, questions arise about the future of these applications. In parallel, quantum computing has made significant progress with the potential to break limits. Major companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft provide access to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Despite the theoretical promise of Shor's and Grover's algorithms, practical implementation on current quantum devices faces challenges, such as demanding additional resources and a high number of controlled operations. To tackle these challenges and optimize the utilization of limited onboard qubits, we introduce ReSaQuS, a resource-efficient index-value searching system within a quantum-classical hybrid framework. Building on Grover's algorithm, ReSaQuS employs an automatically managed iterative search approach. This method analyzes problem size, filters fewer probable data points, and progressively reduces the dataset with decreasing qubit requirements. Implemented using Qiskit and evaluated through extensive experiments, ReSaQuS has demonstrated a substantial reduction, up to 86.36\% in cumulative qubit consumption and 72.72\% in active periods, reinforcing its potential in optimizing quantum computing application deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation for diatomic molecules in deSitter and anti-deSitter spaces is studied using the extended uncertainty principle formulation. The equations are solved by the Nikiforov-Uvarov method for both the Kratzer potential and the pseudoharmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues of the system have been derived analytically, and the exact expressions of the eigenfunctions are provided in terms of Romanovski and Jacobi polynomials. The impact of the spatial deformation parameter on the bound states is also examined, with experimental results used to establish an upper limit for this parameter.</description>

      <title>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2&gt;0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</description>

      <title>Tight Quantum Lower Bound for Approximate Counting with Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.06879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove tight lower bounds for the following variant of the counting problem considered by Aaronson, Kothari, Kretschmer, and Thaler (2020). The task is to distinguish whether an input set $x\subseteq [n]$ has size either $k$ or $k'=(1+\varepsilon)k$. We assume the algorithm has access to
  * the membership oracle, which, for each $i\in [n]$, can answer whether $i\in x$, or not; and \item the uniform superposition $|\psi_x\rangle = \sum_{i\in x} |i\rangle/\sqrt{|x|}$ over the elements of $x$. Moreover, we consider three different ways how the algorithm can access this state:
  - the algorithm can have copies of the state $|\psi_x\rangle$;
  - the algorithm can execute the reflecting oracle which reflects about the state $|\psi_x\rangle$;
  - the algorithm can execute the state-generating oracle (or its inverse) which performs the transformation $|0\rangle\mapsto|\psi_x\rangle$.
  Without the second type of resources (the ones related to $|\psi_x\rangle$), the problem is well-understood. The study of the problem with the second type of resources was recently initiated by Aaronson et al. We completely resolve the problem for all values of $1/k \le \varepsilon\le 1$, giving tight trade-offs between all types of resources available to the algorithm. We also demonstrate that our lower bounds are tight. Thus, we close the main open problems from Aaronson et al.
  The lower bounds are proven using variants of the adversary bound from Belovs (2015) and employing representation theory of the symmetric group applied to the $S_n$-modules $\mathbb{C}^{\binom{[n]}k}$ and $\mathbb{C}^{\binom{[n]}k}\otimes \mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by quantum network applications over classical channels, we initiate the study of $n$-party resource states from which LOCC protocols can create EPR-pairs between any $k$ disjoint pairs of parties. We give constructions of such states where $k$ is not too far from the optimal $n/2$ while the individual parties need to hold only a constant number of qubits. In the special case when each party holds only one qubit, we describe a family of $n$-qubit states with $k$ proportional to $\log n$ based on Reed-Muller codes, as well as small numerically found examples for $k=2$ and $k=3$. We also prove some lower bounds, for example showing that if $k=n/2$ then the parties must have at least $\Omega(\log\log n)$ qubits each.</description>

Abstract: By mapping the scalar Helmholtz equation (SHE) to the Sch\"{r}odinger form we investigate the behaviour of $\mathcal{PT}$ optical structure when the refractive index distribution $n$ admits variation in the longitudinal direction only. Interpreting the Sch\"{r}odinger equation in terms of a superpotential we determine the supersymmetric partners for $n$. We also obtain new analytical solutions for the refractive index profiles and provide graphical illustrations for them.</description>

Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity of the Kronecker coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether or not the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group count some set of combinatorial objects is a longstanding open question. In this work we show that a given Kronecker coefficient is proportional to the rank of a projector that can be measured efficiently using a quantum computer. In other words a Kronecker coefficient counts the dimension of the vector space spanned by the accepting witnesses of a QMA verifier, where QMA is the quantum analogue of NP. This implies that approximating the Kronecker coefficients to within a given relative error is not harder than a certain natural class of quantum approximate counting problems that captures the complexity of estimating thermal properties of quantum many-body systems. A second consequence is that deciding positivity of Kronecker coefficients is contained in QMA, complementing a recent NP-hardness result of Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley and Walter. We obtain similar results for the related problem of approximating row sums of the character table of the symmetric group. Finally, we discuss an efficient quantum algorithm that approximates normalized Kronecker coefficients to inverse-polynomial additive error.</description>

      <title>High Dynamic Range Vector Atomic Magnetometer with 1 part-per-billion Resolution in Earth Field Range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a high-dynamic-range vector atomic magnetometer based on applying a fast-rotating magnetic field to a pulsed $^{87}$Rb scalar atomic magnetometer. This method enables simultaneous measurements of the total magnetic field and two polar angles relative to the plane of magnetic field rotation. Using two channels in a gradiometer mode, it provides simultaneous measurements of the total field gradient with a sensitivity of 50 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ (1 part per billion), as well as two polar angles with resolutions of 8 $\mathrm{nrad/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 50 $\mu$T Earth field strength. The noise spectrums of these measurements are flat down to 1 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively. Crucially, this approach avoids several metrological difficulties associated with vector magnetometers and gradiometers. We detail the fundamental, systematic, and practical limits of such vector magnetometers. Notably, we provide a comprehensive study of the systematic effects of vector atomic magnetometers. We introduce a new concept of dynamic heading error and investigate several other systematic effects. A unique cosine-altering rotating field modulation is proposed to cancel out these systematics. Additionally, we derive fundamental limits on the sensitivity of such sensors and demonstrate that the vector sensitivity of the sensor can approach its scalar sensitivity while retaining the accuracy and metrological advantages of scalar sensors. This high-dynamic-range vector magnetometer, with ultrahigh resolution and inherent calibration, is suitable for a wide array of applications.</description>

Abstract: Correlation is the basic mechanism of every measurement model, as one never accesses the measured system directly. Instead, correlations are created, codifying information about the measurable property into the environment. Here, we address the problem of the emergence of physical reality from the quantum world by introducing a model that interpolates between weak and strong non-selective measurements for qudits. By utilizing Heisenberg-Weyl operators, our model suggests that independently of the interaction intensity between the system and the environment, full information about the observable of interest can always be obtained by making the system interact with many environmental qudits, following a Quantum Darwinism framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information science may lead to technological breakthroughs in computing, cryptography and sensing. For the implementation of these tasks, however, complex devices with many components are needed and the quantum advantage may easily be spoiled by failure of few parts only. A paradigmatic example are quantum networks. There, not only noise sources like photon absorption or imperfect quantum memories lead to long waiting times and low fidelity, but also hardware components may break, leading to a dysfunctionality of the entire network. For the successful long-term deployment of quantum networks in the future, it is important to take such deterioration effects into consideration during the design phase. Using methods from reliability theory and the theory of aging we develop an analytical approach for characterizing the functionality of networks under aging and repair mechanisms, also for non-trivial topologies. Combined with numerical simulations, our results allow to optimize long-distance entanglement distribution under aging effects.</description>

Abstract: Time-translation symmetry breaking is a mechanism for the emergence of non-stationary many-body phases, so-called time-crystals, in Markovian open quantum systems. Dynamical aspects of time-crystals have been extensively explored over the recent years. However, much less is known about their thermodynamic properties, also due to the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of these phases. Here, we consider the paradigmatic boundary time-crystal system, in a finite-temperature environment, and demonstrate the persistence of the time-crystalline phase at any temperature. Furthermore, we analyze thermodynamic aspects of the model investigating, in particular, heat currents, power exchange and irreversible entropy production. Our work sheds light on the thermodynamic cost of sustaining nonequilibrium time-crystalline phases and provides a framework for characterizing time-crystals as possible resources for, e.g., quantum sensing. Our results may be verified in experiments, for example with trapped ions or superconducting circuits, since we connect thermodynamic quantities with mean value and covariance of collective (magnetization) operators.</description>

Abstract: Realization of practical superconducting quantum computing requires many qubits of long coherence time. Compared to the commonly used Ta deposited on c-plane sapphire, which occasionally form {\alpha}-Ta (111) grains and \b{eta}-tantalum grains, high quality Ta (110) film can grow epitaxial on a-plane sapphire because of the atomic relationships at the interface. Well-ordered {\alpha}-Ta (110) film on wafer-scale a-plane sapphire has been prepared. The film exhibits high residual resistance ratio. Transmon qubits fabricated using these film shows relaxation times exceeding 150 {\mu}s. The results suggest Ta film on a-plane sapphire is a promising choice for long coherence time qubit on wafer scale.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Otto Engine with Shortcuts to Thermalization and Adiabaticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14847v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the energetic advantage of accelerating a quantum harmonic oscillator Otto engine by use of shortcuts to adiabaticity (for the expansion and compression strokes) and to equilibrium (for the hot isochore), by means of counter-diabatic (CD) driving. By comparing various protocols with and without CD driving, we find that, applying both type of shortcuts leads to enhanced power and efficiency even after the driving costs are taken into account. The hybrid protocol not only retains its advantage in the limit cycle, but also recovers engine functionality (i.e. a positive power output) in parameter regimes where an uncontrolled, finite-time Otto cycle fails. We show that controlling three strokes of the cycle leads to an overall improvement of the performance metrics compared with controlling only the two adiabatic strokes. Moreover, we numerically calculate the limit cycle behavior of the engine and show that the engines with accelerated isochoric and adiabatic strokes display a superior power output in this mode of operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a classical algorithm for simulating universal quantum circuits composed of "free" nearest-neighbour matchgates or equivalently fermionic-linear-optical (FLO) gates, and "resourceful" non-Gaussian gates. We achieve the promotion of the efficiently simulable FLO subtheory to universal quantum computation by gadgetizing controlled phase gates with arbitrary phases employing non-Gaussian resource states. Our key contribution is the development of a novel phase-sensitive algorithm for simulating FLO circuits. This allows us to decompose the resource states arising from gadgetization into free states at the level of statevectors rather than density matrices. The runtime cost of our algorithm for estimating the Born-rule probability of a given quantum circuit scales polynomially in all circuit parameters, except for a linear dependence on the newly introduced FLO extent, which scales exponentially with the number of controlled-phase gates. More precisely, as a result of finding optimal decompositions of relevant resource states, the runtime doubles for every maximally resourceful (e.g., swap or CZ) gate added. Crucially, this cost compares very favourably with the best known prior algorithm, where each swap gate increases the simulation cost by a factor of approximately 9. For a quantum circuit containing arbitrary FLO unitaries and $k$ controlled-Z gates, we obtain an exponential improvement $O(4.5^k)$ over the prior state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison to the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, and reveal the existence of non-bosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states %must be bipartite long-range entangled for any bipartition. That is, such mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</description>

      <title>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of orbital angular momentum</title>

Abstract: The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of orbital angular momentum eigenstates is described. Using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, distributions are derived that provide a measure of how paths contribute towards any given eigenstate. In the limit of long travel-time, these distributions turn out to be real-valued, non-negative functions of a momentum variable that describes classical travel between the endpoints of a path (with the paths explicitly including nonclassical ones, described in terms of elastica). The distributions are functions of both this characteristic momentum as well as a polar angle that provides a tilt, relative to the z-axis of the chosen coordinate system, of the geodesic that connects the endpoints. The resulting description provides a replacement for the well-known "vector model" for describing orbital angular momentum, and importantly, it includes treatment of the case when the quantum number $\ell$ is zero (i.e., s-states).</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the strengths of different quantum hardware components may enhance the capabilities of emerging quantum processors. Here, we propose and analyze a quantum architecture that leverages the non-local connectivity of optics, along with the exquisite quantum control offered by superconducting microwave circuits, to produce entangled optical resource states. Contrary to previous proposals on optically distributing entanglement between superconducting microwave processors, we use squeezing between microwaves and optics to produce microwave-optical Bell pairs in a dual-rail encoding from a single microwave quantum processor. Moreover, the microwave quantum processor allows us to deterministically entangle microwave-optical Bell pairs into larger cluster states, from which entangled optical photons can be extracted through microwave measurements. Our scheme paves the way for small microwave quantum processors to create heralded entangled optical resource states for optical quantum computation, communication, and sensing using imperfect microwave-optics transducers. We expect that improved isolation of the superconducting processor from stray optical fields will allow the scheme to be demonstrated using currently available hardware.</description>

Abstract: Bell nonlocality refers to correlations between two distant, entangled particles that challenge classical notions of local causality. Beyond its foundational significance, nonlocality is crucial for device-independent technologies like quantum key distribution and randomness generation. Nonlocality quickly deteriorates in the presence of noise, and restoring nonlocal correlations requires additional resources. These often come in the form of many instances of the input state and joint measurements, incurring a significant resource overhead. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that single copies of Bell-local states, incapable of violating any standard Bell inequality, can give rise to nonlocality after being embedded into a quantum network of multiple parties. We subject the initial entangled state to a quantum channel that broadcasts part of the state to two independent receivers and certify the nonlocality in the resulting network by violating a tailored Bell-like inequality. We obtain these results without making any assumptions about the prepared states, the quantum channel, or the validity of quantum theory. Our findings have fundamental implications for nonlocality and enable the practical use of nonlocal correlations in real-world applications, even in scenarios dominated by noise.</description>

Abstract: There has been a recent interest in quantum algorithms for the modelling and prediction of non-unitary quantum dynamics using current quantum computers. The field of quantum biology is one area where these algorithms could prove to be useful, as biological systems are generally intractable to treat in their complete form, but amenable to an open quantum systems approach. Here we present the application of a recently developed singular value decomposition algorithm to two well-studied benchmark systems in quantum biology: excitonic energy transport through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex and the radical pair mechanism for avian navigation. We demonstrate that the singular value decomposition algorithm is capable of capturing accurate short- and long-time dynamics for these systems through implementation on a quantum simulator, and conclude that this algorithm has the potential to be an effective tool for the future study of systems relevant to quantum biology.</description>

Abstract: Developing the field of neuromorphic quantum computing necessitates designing scalable quantum memory devices. Here, we propose a superconducting quantum memory device in the microwave regime, termed as a microwave quantum memcapacitor. It comprises two linked resonators, the primary one is coupled to a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device, which allows for the modulation of the resonator properties through external magnetic flux. The auxiliary resonator, operated through weak measurements, provides feedback to the primary resonator, ensuring stable memory behaviour. This device operates with a classical input in one cavity while reading the response in the other, serving as a fundamental building block toward arrays of microwave quantum memcapacitors. We observe that a bipartite setup can retain its memory behaviour and gains entanglement and quantum correlations. Our findings pave the way for the experimental implementation of memcapacitive superconducting quantum devices and memory device arrays for neuromorphic quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have become a promising platform for quantum computing, especially the field programmable qubit array (FPQA) endowed with the unique capability of atom movement. This feature allows dynamic alterations in qubit connectivity during runtime, which can reduce the cost of executing long-range gates and improve parallelism. However, this added flexibility introduces new challenges in circuit compilation. Inspired by the placement and routing strategies for FPGAs, we propose to map all data qubits to fixed atoms while utilizing movable atoms to route for 2-qubit gates between data qubits. Coined flying ancillas, these mobile atoms function as ancilla qubits, dynamically generated and recycled during execution. We present Q-Pilot, a scalable compiler for FPQA employing flying ancillas to maximize circuit parallelism. For two important quantum applications, quantum simulation and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we devise domain-specific routing strategies. In comparison to alternative technologies such as superconducting devices or fixed atom arrays, Q-Pilot effectively harnesses the flexibility of FPQA, achieving reductions of 1.4x, 27.7x, and 6.3x in circuit depth for 100-qubit random, quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Delta as a Singular Potential for the 2D Schrodinger Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of distributionally generalized quantum theory, the object $H\psi$ is defined as a distribution. The mathematical significance is a mild generalization for the theory of para- and pseudo-differential operators (as well as a generalization of the weak eigenvalue problem), where the $\psi$-do symbol (which is not a proper linear operator in this generalized case) can have its coefficient functions take on singular distributional values. Here, a distribution is said to be singular if it is not L$^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $p\geq 1$. Physically, the significance is a mathematically rigorous method, which does not rely upon renormalization or regularization of any kind, while producing bound state energy results in agreement with the literature. In addition, another benefit is that the method does not rely upon self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace operator. This is important when the theory is applied to non-Schrodinger systems, as is the case for the Dirac equation and a necessary property of any finite rigorous version of quantum field theory. The distributional interpretation resolves the need to evaluate a wave function at a point where it fails to be defined. For $d=2$, this occurs as $K_o(a|x|)\delta(x)$, where $K_o$ is the zeroth order MacDonald function. Finally, there is also the identification of a missing anomalous length scale, owing to the scale invariance of the formal symbol(ic) Hamiltonian, as well as the common identity for the logarithmic function, with $a,\,b\in\mathbb{R}^+$, $\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$, which loses unitlessness in its arguments. Consequently, the energy or point spectrum is generalized as a family (set indexed by the continuum) of would-be spectral values, called the C-spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We discuss how quantum jumps affect localized regimes in driven-dissipative disordered many-body systems featuring a localization transition. We introduce a deformation of the Lindblad master equation that interpolates between the standard Lindblad and the no-jump non-Hermitian dynamics of open quantum systems. As a platform, we use a disordered chain of hard-core bosons with nearest-neighbor interactions and subject to incoherent drive and dissipation at alternate sites. We probe both the statistics of complex eigenvalues of the deformed Liouvillian and dynamical observables of physical relevance. We show that reducing the number of quantum jumps, achievable through realistic postselection protocols, can promote the emergence of the localized phase. Our findings are based on exact diagonalization and time-dependent matrix-product states techniques.</description>

Abstract: Conventional heterodyne readout schemes are now under reconsideration due to the realization of techniques to evade its inherent 3 dB signal-to-noise penalty. The application of high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed states can further improve the readout sensitivity of audio-band signals. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced heterodyne readout of two spatially distinct interferometers with direct optical signal combination, circumventing the 3 dB heterodyne signal-to-noise penalty. Applying a high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed state, we show further signal-to-noise improvement of an injected audio band signal of 3.5 dB. This technique is applicable for quantum-limited high-precision experiments, with application to searches for quantum gravity, gravitational wave detection and wavelength-multiplexed quantum communication.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking can occur in systems periodically driven at a certain period. We predict a spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry in an atom-cavity system without external driving, in which a time scale is determined by the time of light bypass of the resonator. We demonstrate that there is a parameter range, in which a system state returns to its initial state only after two bypasses of the resonator. We believe that the predicted phenomenon opens a way to a new direction in the time crystal field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum interferences based on beam splitting are widely used for entanglement. However, the quantitative description of the entanglement and wavepacket shaping facilitated by this entanglement remain unexplored. Here we analytically study the interference of two photons with different temporal shapes through a beam splitter (BS), then propose its application in temporal entanglement and shaping of photons. The temporal entanglement described by Von Neumann entropy is determined by the splitting ratio of BS and temporal indistinguishability of input photons. Maximum entanglement can be achieved with a 50/50 BS configuration. Then, detecting one of the entangled photons at a specific time enables the probabilistic shaping of the other photon. This process can shape the exponentially decaying (ED) wavepacket into the ED sine shapes, which can be further shaped into Gaussian shapes with fidelity exceeding 99\%. The temporal entanglement and shaping of photons based on interference may solve the shape mismatch issues in large-scale optical quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph exhibits the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. Given that Max-$q$-XORSAT on an Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph is known to exhibit the OGP, and since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving dense connectivities is a challenge for most quantum computing platforms today, and a particularly crucial one for the case of quantum annealing applications. In this context, we present a scalable architecture for quantum annealers defined on a graph of degree $d=3$ and containing exclusively 2-local interactions to realize an all-to-all connected Ising model. This amounts to an efficient braiding of logical chains of qubits which can be derived from a description of the problem in terms of triangles. We also devise strategies to address the challenges of scalable architectures, such as the faster shrinking of the gap due to the larger physical Hilbert space, based on driver Hamiltonians more suited to the symmetries of the logical solution space. We thus show an alternative route to scale up devices dedicated to classical optimization tasks within the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify (\emph{herald}) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum information processing with continuous-variable (CV) quantum information carriers holds significant promise for applications in quantum communication and quantum internet. However, applying Gaussian state distillation and quantum error correction (QEC) faces limitations imposed by no-go results concerning local Gaussian unitary operations and classical communications. This paper introduces a Gaussian QEC protocol that relies solely on local Gaussian resources. A pivotal component of our approach is CV gate teleportation using entangled Gaussian states, which facilitates the implementation of the partial transpose operation on a quantum channel. Consequently, we can efficiently construct a two-mode noise-polarized channel from two noisy Gaussian channels. Furthermore, this QEC protocol naturally extends to a nonlocal Gaussian state distillation protocol.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong quantum-enhanced sensitivity throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance of our probe is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in batteries for Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev interactions</title>

Abstract: A quantum advantage can be achieved in the unitary charging of quantum batteries if their cells are interacting. Here, we try to clarify with some analytical calculations whether and how this quantum advantage is achieved for sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev interactions. By performing a simple modelization, we find that for $q$-point rescaled sparse SYK interactions the quantum advantage goes as $\Gamma\sim N^{\frac{\alpha}{q}-\frac{1}{2}}$, where $\alpha$ is related to the connectivity and $N$ is the number of cells.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Decoherence and Memory Effects in Green Fluorescent Proteins by Dielectric Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the dynamical decoherence of the chromophores within a green fluorescent protein when coupled to a finite-temperature dielectric environment. Such systems are of significant interest due to their anomalously long coherence lifetimes compared to other biomolecules. We work within the spin-boson model and employ the Hierarchical Equations of Motion formalism which allows for the accounting of the full non-perturbative and non-Markovian characteristics of the system dynamics. We analyse the level coherence of independent green fluorescent protein chromophores and the energy transfer dynamics in homo-dimer green fluorescent proteins, focusing on the effect of dielectric relaxation on the timescales of these systems. Using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, we generate spectral densities from local electric susceptibility generated from Poisson's equation and employ a Debye dielectric model for the solvent environment. For different system architectures, we identify a number of very striking features in the dynamics of the chromophore induced by the dielectric relaxation of the environment, resulting in strong memory effects that extend the coherence lifetime of the system. Remarkably, the complex architecture of the green fluorescent protein, which includes a cavity-like structure around the atomic system, is well suited to preserving the coherences in the homo-dimer system. The system dynamics generate a dynamical correlation between the coherent energy transfer between its sub-systems and the entropy production, which can lead to transient reductions in entropy, a unique feature of the non-Markovian nature of the system-environment interaction.</description>

      <title>Strong broadband intensity noise squeezing from near-infrared to terahertz frequencies in semiconductor lasers with nonlinear dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation and application of squeezed light have long been central goals of quantum optics, enabling sensing below the standard quantum limit, optical quantum computing platforms, and more. Intensity noise squeezing of bright (coherent) states, in contrast to squeezed vacuum, is relatively underdeveloped. Bright squeezing has been generated directly through nonlinear optical processes or ``quietly pumped'' semiconductor lasers. However, these methods suffer from weak squeezing limits, narrow operating wavelength ranges, and have not been explored at large bandwidths. Here, we show how semiconductor lasers with sharp intensity-dependent dissipation can support highly broadband intensity noise squeezing from infrared (IR) to terahertz (THz) wavelengths, the latter of which has remained unexplored in quantum noise studies. Our protocol realizes strongly ($&gt;10$ dB) intensity noise-squeezed intracavity quantum states, which could create a new regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments, as well as strong output squeezing surpassing gigahertz bandwidths. Furthermore, we show how the same systems also create self-pulsing and bistable mean field behavior, enabling control of light in both the temporal and noise domains. The existence of these multiple functionalities in both the classical and quantum mechanical domains in a single semiconductor laser platform, from IR to THz wavelengths, could enable advances in on-chip quantum optical communication, computing, and sensing across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cavity Moir\'e Materials: Controlling Magnetic Frustration with Quantum Light-Matter Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between light and matter at the single quantum level and has played a central role in quantum science and technology. Combining the idea of cavity QED with moir\'e materials, we theoretically show that strong quantum light-matter interaction provides a way to control frustrated magnetism. Specifically, we develop a theory of moir\'e materials confined in a cavity consisting of thin polar van der Waals crystals. We show that nontrivial quantum geometry of moir\'e flat bands leads to electromagnetic vacuum dressing of electrons, which produces appreciable changes in single-electron energies and manifests itself as long-range electron hoppings. We apply our general formulation to a twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayer encapsulated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride layers and predict its phase diagram at different twist angles and light-matter coupling strengths. Our results indicate that the cavity confinement enables one to control magnetic frustration of moir\'e materials and might allow for realizing various exotic phases such as a quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.</description>

      <title>Initial value formulation of a quantum damped harmonic oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in-in formalism and its influence functional generalization are widely used to describe the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of unitary and open quantum systems, respectively. In this paper, we build on these techniques to develop an effective theory of a quantum damped harmonic oscillator and use it to study initial state-dependence, decoherence, and thermalization. We first consider a Gaussian initial state and quadratic influence functional and obtain general equations for the Green's functions of the oscillator. We solve the equations in the specific case of time-local dissipation and use the resulting Green's functions to obtain the purity and unequal-time two-point correlations of the oscillator. We find that the dynamics must include a non-vanishing noise term to yield physical results for the purity and that the oscillator decoheres in time such that the late-time density operator is thermal. We show that the frequency spectrum or unequal-time correlations can, however, distinguish between the damped oscillator and an isolated oscillator in thermal equilibrium, and obtain a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation for the damped oscillator. We briefly consider time-nonlocal dissipation as well, to show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is satisfied for a specific choice of dissipation kernels. Lastly, we develop a double in-out path integral approach to go beyond Gaussian initial states and show that our equal-time results for time-local dissipation are in fact non-perturbative in the initial state.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Al/AlOx/Al junctions with high uniformity and stability on sapphire substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tantalum and aluminum on sapphire are widely used platforms for qubits of long coherent time. As quantum chips scale up, the number of Josephson junctions on Sapphire increases. Thus, both the uniformity and stability of the junctions are crucial to quantum devices, such as scalable superconducting quantum computer circuit, and quantum-limited amplifiers. By optimizing the fabrication process, especially, the conductive layer during the electron beam lithography process, Al/AlOx/Al junctions of sizes ranging from 0.0169 to 0.04 {\mu}m2 on sapphire substrates were prepared. The relative standard deviation of room temperature resistances (RN) of these junctions is better than 1.7% on 15 mmx15 mm chips, and better than 2.66% on 2 inch wafers, which is the highest uniformity on sapphire substrates has been reported. The junctions are robust and stable in resistances as temperature changes. The resistances increase by the ratio of 9.73% relative to RN as the temperature ramp down to 4K, and restore their initial values in the reverse process as the temperature ramps back to RT. After being stored in a nitrogen cabinet for 100 days, the resistance of the junctions changed by1.16% in average. The demonstration of uniform and stable Josephson junctions in large area paves the way for the fabrication of superconducting chip of hundreds of qubits on sapphire substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intrigued by the discovery of the long lifetime in the {\alpha}-Ta/Al2O3-based Transmon qubit, researchers recently found {\alpha}-Ta film is a promising platform for fabricating multi-qubits with long coherence time. To meet the requirements for integrating superconducting quantum circuits, the ideal method is to grow {\alpha}-Ta film on a silicon substrate compatible with industrial manufacturing. Here we report the {\alpha}-Ta film sputter-grown on Si (100) with a low-loss superconducting TiNx buffer layer. The {\alpha}-Ta film with a large growth temperature window has a good crystalline character. The superconducting critical transition temperature (Tc) and residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in the {\alpha}-Ta film grown at 500 {\deg}C are higher than that in the {\alpha}-Ta film grown at room temperature (RT). These results provide crucial experimental clues toward understanding the connection between the superconductivity and the materials' properties in the {\alpha}-Ta film and open a new route for producing a high-quality {\alpha}-Ta film on silicon substrate for future industrial superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a consistent thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of conformal metric deformations in the quasi-radial coordinate parameterizing the 3-sphere in the conformally compactified Minkowski spacetime $S^1\times S^3$. Prior to reduction of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operators to a Schr\"odinger form, a corresponding class of exactly solvable potentials (each one containing a scalar and a gradient term) is found. In particular, the scalar piece of these potentials can be exactly or quasi-exactly solvable, and among them we find the finite range confining trigonometric potentials of P\"oschl-Teller, Scarf and Rosen-Morse. As an application of the results developed in the paper, the large compactification radius limit of the interaction described by some of these potentials is studied, and this regime is shown to be relevant to a quantum mechanical quark deconfinement mechanism.</description>

      <title>A quantum computing concept for 1-D elastic wave simulation with exponential speedup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has attracted considerable attention in recent years because it promises speed-ups that conventional supercomputers cannot offer, at least for some applications. Though existing quantum computers are, in most cases, still too small to solve significant problems, their future impact on domain sciences is already being explored now. Within this context, we present a quantum computing concept for 1-D elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media with two components: a theoretical formulation and an implementation on a real quantum computer. The method rests on a finite-difference approximation, followed by a sparsity-preserving transformation of the discrete elastic wave equation to a Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which can be simulated directly on a gate-based quantum computer. An implementation on an error-free quantum simulator verifies our approach and forms the basis of numerical experiments with small problems on the real quantum computer IBM Brisbane. The latter produce simulation results that qualitatively agree with the error-free version but are contaminated by quantum decoherence and noise effects. Complementing the discrete transformation to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation by a continuous version allows the replacement of finite differences by other spatial discretisation schemes, such as the spectral-element method. Anticipating the emergence of error-corrected quantum chips, an analogy between our method and analyses of coupled mass-spring systems suggests that our quantum computing approach may lead to wave field simulations that run exponentially faster than simulations on classical computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays of neutral atoms provide a versatile platform for quantum simulation due to the range of interactions and Hamiltonians that can be realized and explored. We propose to simulate a two-component Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping using arrays of multilevel Rydberg atoms featuring resonant dipolar interactions. The diversity of states that can be used to encode the local Hilbert space of the Bose-Hubbard model enables control of the relative hopping rate of each component and even the realization of spin-flip hopping. We use numerical simulations to show how multilevel Rydberg atoms provide an opportunity to explore the diverse non-equilibrium quench dynamics of the model. For example, we demonstrate a separation of the relaxation timescales of effective spin and charge degrees of freedom, and observe regimes of slow relaxation when the effective hopping rates of the two components are vastly different due to dynamical constraints arising from hardcore boson interactions. We discuss prospects for studying these effects in state-of-the-art Rydberg tweezer arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-conventional description of the vacuum energy in quantum field theory in terms of quantum entropy. Precisely, we show that the vacuum energy of any non-interacting quantum field at zero temperature is proportional to the quantum entropy of the qubit degrees of freedom associated with virtual fluctuations. We prove this for fermions first, and then extend the derivation to quanta of any spin. Finally, we use these results to obtain the first law of thermodynamics for a non-interacting quantum vacuum at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an operator system $\mathcal{S}$, we define the parameters $r_k(\mathcal{S})$ (resp. $d_k(\mathcal{S})$) defined as the maximal value of the completely bounded norm of a unital $k$-positive map from an arbitrary operator system into $\mathcal{S}$ (resp. from $\mathcal{S}$ into an arbitrary operator system).
  In the case of the matrix algebras $M_n$, for $1 \leq k \leq n$, we compute the exact value $r_k(M_n) = \frac{2n-k}{k}$ and show upper and lower bounds on the parameters $d_k(M_n)$.
  Moreover, when $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite-dimensional operator system, adapting recent results of Passer and the 4th author, we show that the sequence $(r_k( \mathcal{S}))$ tends to $1$ if and only if $\mathcal{S}$ is exact and that the sequence $(d_k(\mathcal{S}))$ tends to $1$ if and only if $\mathcal{S}$ has the lifting property.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problems arising from the presence of Byzantine servers in a quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) setting. This is the first work to precisely define what the capabilities of Byzantine servers could be in a QPIR context. We show that quantum Byzantine servers have more capabilities than their classical counterparts due to the possibilities created by quantum encoding procedures. We focus on quantum Byzantine servers that can apply any reversible operation on their individual qudits. In this case, Byzantine servers can generate any error, i.e., this covers \emph{all} possible single qudit operations that can be applied by Byzantine servers on their qudits. We design a scheme based on cross-subspace alignment (CSA) and we show that this scheme achieves superdense coding gain in some cases.</description>

      <title>Hermitian stochastic methodology for X-ray superfluorescence</title>

Abstract: A recently introduced theoretical framework for modeling the dynamics of X-ray amplified spontaneous emission is based on stochastic sampling of the density matrix of quantum emitters and the radiation field, similarly to other phase-space sampling techniques. While based on first principles and providing valuable theoretical insights, the original stochastic differential equations exhibit divergences and numerical instabilities. Here, we resolve this issue by accounting the stochastic components perturbatively. The refined formalism accurately reproduces the properties of spontaneous emission and proves universally applicable for describing all stages of collective X-ray emission in paraxial geometry, including spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and the non-linear regime. Through numerical examples, we analyze key features of superfluorescence in one-dimensional approximation. Importantly, single realizations of the underlying stochastic equations can be fully interpreted as individual experimental observations of superfluorescence.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum spectrum and entanglement in a rotating accelerated reference frame</title>

Abstract: The particle definition varies across different theories. The quantum field theory in curved spacetime shows that from the perspective of a linearly accelerated observer, an inertial empty space may be full of thermal particles. This effect is known as the Unruh effect. When the degrees of freedom of orbital angular momentum (OAM) are considered, all OAM modes share the same expected particle number. Here, we examine the OAM spectrum in a rotating accelerated reference frame to see how the spectrum differs from the linear accelerated case. When the observer starts to rotate, not all OAM modes are allowed and some negative energy modes show up. To understand how a rotating accelerated observer actually perceives these particles, the Unruh-DeWitt detector and its detailed balance are studied. This relation is studied both in the comoving inertial frame and in the rest frame. Based on these results, the OAM entanglement degradation is explored in two-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, respectively. The results indicate that the entanglement dimension and the highest order of OAM modes are mainly related to the acceleration and the rotation, respectively. It is then demonstrated that these results can be generalized to all stationary trajectories.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Learning parameter dependence for Fourier-based option pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing issue in mathematical finance is the speed-up of pricing options, especially multi-asset options. A recent study has proposed to use tensor train learning algorithms to speed up Fourier transform (FT)-based option pricing, utilizing the ability of tensor networks to compress high-dimensional tensors. Another usage of the tensor network is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. In this study, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices. We show that, in the tested cases involving up to 11 assets, the proposed method is comparable to or outperforms Monte Carlo simulation with $10^5$ paths in terms of computational complexity, keeping the comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>High-finesse nanofiber Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator in a portable storage container</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present characterization and storage methods for a high-finesse nanofiber Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator. Reflection spectroscopy from both ends of the resonator allows for evaluation of the mirror transmittances and optical loss inside the resonator. To maintain the quality of the nanofiber resonator after the fabrication, we have developed a portable storage container. By filling the container with dry, clean nitrogen gas, we can prevent contamination of the nanofiber during storage. This approach allows us to minimize the additional optical loss to less than 0.08% over a week. The portable container facilitates both the fabrication and subsequent experimentation with the resonator in different locations. This flexibility expands the range of applications, including quantum optics, communication, and sensing.</description>
