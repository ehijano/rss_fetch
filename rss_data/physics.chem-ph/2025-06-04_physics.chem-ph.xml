      <title>Computing Hydrogen Tunneling Splittings with Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Multireference Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen tunneling is an important process that impacts reaction rates and molecular spectra. Describing and understanding this process requires a quantum mechanical treatment of the transferring hydrogen. The nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach treats specified nuclei quantum mechanically on the same level as electrons and has recently been implemented at the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) wavefunction level. The NEO-MRCI method includes both the static correlation necessary to describe hydrogen tunneling and the electron-proton dynamic correlation required for computing quantitatively accurate nuclear-electronic vibronic states. Herein, the NEO-MRCI method is used to compute the nuclear-electronic wavefunctions and corresponding vibronic energies for four hydrogen tunneling systems at fixed geometries for a range of donor-acceptor distances. Comparison of the NEO-MRCI results to numerically exact grid-based calculations shows that the NEO-MRCI method can be used to obtain accurate hydrogen and deuterium tunneling splittings. Thus, this work presents an effective method for studying hydrogen tunneling systems.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent detected 2D spectroscopy via pulse shaper: insights and strategies for optimally untangling the nonlinear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (A-2DES) provides valuable insights into ultrafast dynamics within functional materials and devices by measuring incoherent signals like photocurrent. This work details the implementation and optimization of a pulse-shaper-based A-2DES setup, focusing on methodological strategies crucial for acquiring high-fidelity data. We present a comprehensive analysis of phase modulation routines, elucidating the critical interplay between pattern parameters (N, $\mathrm{n}_\mathrm{i}$), pattern repetitions ($\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{rep}$), laser repetition rate, and acousto-optic pulse shaper constraints (e.g., streaming rate, RF generator nonlinearities). Utilizing a perovskite solar cell as a model system, we systematically identify and characterize significant inaccuracies inherent to A-2DES measurements. These include distortions originating from Fourier transform processing of improperly trimmed time-domain data (phase leakage), signal accumulation effects due to insufficient sample response discharge between pulse sequences at high repetition rates, and shortcomings induced by pulse shaper operation at elevated streaming powers. Crucially, we demonstrate robust data post-processing strategies, including precise data point selection for Fourier analysis and phase correction routine, to effectively mitigate these imperfections and retrieve accurate 2D spectra. This rigorous methodological investigation and anomalous features characterization provides essential guidelines for optimizing pulse-shaper-based A-2DES experiments, ensuring data integrity and enabling reliable extraction of complex photophysical information in complex systems.</description>

      <title>The exchange-correlation dipole moment dispersion method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-functional theory (DFT) has become the workhorse of modern computational chemistry, with dispersion corrections such as the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model playing a key role in high-accuracy modelling of large-scale systems. Here, we introduce a new physics-guided XDM variant, termed the exchange-correlation dipole moment (XCDM) model, which supplements XDM with same- and opposite-spin dynamical correlation terms, substantially improving accuracy for molecular $C_6$ dispersion coefficients. Both XDM and XCDM are implemented for use with the Becke-Johnson damping function based on atomic radii, as well as a one-parameter damping function based on atomic numbers, recently proposed by Becke. All four variants are benchmarked on the comprehensive GMTKN55 database using minimally empirical generalised-gradient-approximation, global hybrid, and range-separated hybrid functionals. This marks the first time that the XDM (and many-body dispersion, MBD) corrections have been tested for the GMTKN55 set. Five solid-state benchmarks spanning molecular crystals and layered materials are also considered. The B86bPBE0 hybrid functional, paired with any of the XDM variants, shows excellent performance for molecular systems. Finally, we identify a flaw in the weighted mean absolute deviation (WTMAD-2) scheme commonly used for the GMTKN55 set, which underweights some of its component benchmarks by orders of magnitude. We propose a new WTMAD-4 scheme based on typical errors observed for well-behaved functionals, ensuring fair treatment across all benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A mesoscale phase-field model of intergranular liquid lithium corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phase-field model is developed to simulate intergranular corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels exposed to liquid lithium. The chromium concentration of the material is used to track the mass transport within the metal and liquid (corrosive) phase. The framework naturally captures intergranular corrosion by enhancing the diffusion of chromium along grain boundaries relative to the grain bulk with no special treatment for the corrosion front evolution. The formulation applies to arbitrary 2D and 3D polycrystalline geometries. The framework reproduces experimental measurements of weight loss and corrosion depth for a 9 wt\% Cr ferritic/martensitic steel exposed to static lithium at 600 $^\circ$C. A sensitivity analysis, varying near-surface grain density, grain size, and chromium depletion thickness, highlights the microstructural influence in the corrosion process. Moreover, the significance of saturation is considered and evaluated. Simulation results show that near-surface grain density is a deciding factor, whereas grain size dictates the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion.</description>

      <title>Static vs dynamic rough energy landscapes: Where is diffusion faster?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules in dense environments, such as biological cells, are subjected to forces that fluctuate both in time and in space. While spatial fluctuations are captured by Lifson-Jackson-Zwanzig's model of "diffusion in a rough potential", and temporal fluctuations are often viewed as leading to additional friction effects, a unified view where the environment fluctuates both in time and in space is currently lacking. Here we introduce a discrete-state model of a landscape fluctuating both in time and in space. Importantly, the model accounts for the back-reaction of the diffusing particle on the landscape. As a result we find, surprisingly, that many features of the observable dynamics do not depend on the temporal fluctuation timescales and are already captured by the model of diffusion in a rough potential, even though this assumes a static energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Can the Infamous Boundary Be Found in Macromolecules? Also, von Neumann vs. Schroedinger ensembles, and `Hund's Paradox' in quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: John Bell coined the phrase ``Infamous Boundary" for the point where classical physics splits off from quantum physics. Many authors, including the present one, have advanced theories with the intention of defining and locating this ``shifty split"; most propose that it lies somewhere on the scale of apparatus. But what if it resides at the level of macromolecules? I show here that this question is intimately connected to the choice of thermal ensembles and to the so-called `Hund's Paradox' in quantum chemistry. I propose an experimental set-up that could in principle reveal the IB lurking in asymmetric macromolecules.</description>

      <title>Emergent rigidity percolation of five-fold aggregates enables controllable glass properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses possess outstanding mechanical and physical properties, making them promising candidates for advanced structural and functional applications; however, the lack of understanding and control over their glass transition and solidification processes remains a significant barrier to practical design. The glass transition from liquid to amorphous solid has remained an open problem in physics despite many theories and recent advances in computational efforts. The question of identifying a clear and well-defined diverging length scale accompanying the glass transition has remained unanswered, as has the nature of the transition and, indeed, the presence of a transition at all, as opposed to a mere dynamical crossover. Here we answer these questions using numerical results and theoretical analysis showing that, in atomic (metallic) glass formers, the glass transition coincides with, and is caused by, a continuous rigidity percolation transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like material. The transition occurs as five-fold symmetric atomic clusters progressively aggregate, forming a system-spanning rigid network that marks the onset of mechanical stability. This percolation-driven rigidity growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in the shear modulus G', indicating the emergence of macroscopic solid-like behavior. Beyond this point, which coincides with the Maxwell isostatic point of the percolating structure, dynamical arrest or "freezing-in" prevents further evolution. The long-sought diverging length scale is thus identified as the percolation-driven growth of rigid five-fold clusters, providing a direct link between local structural motifs and macroscopic mechanical properties at the glass transition. These insights offer practical routes to rationally engineer metallic glasses with targeted mechanical stiffness, hardness, and toughness.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Memory Implementation of the Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of dissipative quantum dynamics subject to a non-Markovian environment poses persistent numerical challenges, in particular for structured environments where sharp mode resonances induce long-time system bath correlations. We present a scalable distributed memory implementation of the Mask Assisted Coarse Graining of Influence Coefficients (MACGIC) - Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral (-QUAPI) method that exploits the memory resources of multiple compute nodes and mitigates the memory bottleneck of the method via a new pre-merging algorithm while preserving numerical accuracy. The distributed memory implementation spreads the paths over the computing nodes by means of the MPI protocoll and efficient high level path management is achieved via an implementation based on hash maps. The efficiency of the new implementation is demonstrated in large-scale dissipative quantum dynamics simulations that account for the coupling to a structured non-Markovian environment containing a sharp resonance, a setup for which convergence properties are investigated in depth. Broad applicability and the non-perturbative nature of the simulation method is illustrated via the tuning of the mode resonance frequency of the structured environment with respect to the system frequency. The simulations reveal a splitting of resonances due to strong system-environment interaction and the emergence of sidebands due to multi-excitations of the bosonic mode that are not accounted for in perturbative approaches. The simulations demonstrate the versatility of the new MACGIC-QUAPI method in the presence of strong non-Markovian system bath correlations.</description>

      <title>Charging dynamics of electric double layer nanocapacitors in mean-field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) stores energy by modulating the spatial distribution of ions in the electrolytic solution that it contains. We determine the mean-field time scales for planar EDLC relaxation to equilibrium, after a potential difference is applied. We tackle first the fully symmetric case, where positive and negative ionic species have same valence and diffusivity, and then the general, more complex, asymmetric case. Depending on applied voltage and salt concentration, different regimes appear, revealing a remarkably rich phenomenology relevant for nanocapacitors.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The agreement between the basic expressions of the TRMC method and the analogous expressions of the renewal theory has been demonstrated. The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Wavepacket and Reduced-Density Approaches for High-Dimensional Quantum Dynamics: Application to the Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Asymmetrical Light-Harvesting Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitation-energy transfer (EET) and relaxation in an optically excited building block of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) dendrimers are simulated using wavepackets with the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method and reduced-density matrices with the hierachical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. The dynamics of the ultrafast electronic funneling between the first two excited electronic states in the asymmetrically meta-substituted PPE oligomer with two rings on one branch and three rings on the other side, with a shared ring in between, is treated with 93-dimensional ab initio vibronic-coupling Hamiltonian (VCH) models, either linear or with bilinear and quadratic terms. The linear VCH model is also used to calibrate an open quantum system that falls in a computationally demanding non-perturbative non-Markovian regime. The linear-response absorption and emission spectra are simulated with both the ML-MCTDH and HEOM methods. The latter is further used to explore the nonlinear regime towards two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy. We illustrate how a minimal VCH model with the two main active bright states and the impulsive-pulse limit in third-order response theory may provide at lower cost polarization-sensitive time-resolved signals that monitor the early EET dynamics. We also confirm the essential role played by the high-frequency acetylenic and quinoidal vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Quantitative Estimates for Performance metrics applied to Saddle Search Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rigorous performance evaluation is essential for developing robust algorithms for high-throughput computational chemistry. Traditional benchmarking, however, often struggles to account for system-specific variability, making it difficult to form actionable conclusions. We present a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that rigorously quantifies performance metrics and their uncertainty, enabling a nuanced comparison of algorithmic strategies. We apply this framework to analyze the Dimer method, comparing Conjugate Gradient (CG) and L-BFGS rotation optimizers, with and without the removal of external rotations, across a benchmark of 500 molecular systems. Our analysis confirms that CG offers higher overall robustness than L-BFGS in this context. While the theoretically-motivated removal of external rotations led to higher computational cost (&gt;40% more energy and force calls) for most systems in this set, our models also reveal a subtle interplay, hinting that this feature may improve the reliability of the L-BFGS optimizer. Rather than identifying a single superior method, our findings support the design of adaptive "chain of methods" workflows. This work showcases how a robust statistical paradigm can move beyond simple performance rankings to inform the intelligent, context-dependent application of computational chemistry methods.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian transformation for accurate and efficient band structure interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic band structure is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. We introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI-SCDM (where Wannier functions are generated via the selected columns of the density matrix projection), achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI-SCDM for band structure interpolation, as verified by high-throughput calculations.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Nernst-Planck charging dynamics of an electric double layer capacitor: symmetric and asymmetric binary electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence-Based Gas Sensing with MoS2 Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial Ordering by Self-Assembly of Isotropic Octahedral Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that isotropic octahedral (sixfold branched) junctions with three diagonal endpoint pairs of different colors almost inevitably form a macroscopic assembly of uniaxial order, exhibiting the perfect order of a single color. Monte Carlo simulations of the antiferromagnetic three-state Potts model on the tripartite reo net, consisting of corner-sharing regular octahedrons, confirm this counterintuitive prediction, while showcasing switching self-assembly upon an ordering phase transition. The possible inequivalence of three directions, i.e., more symmetry breaking than uniaxiality, is found and discussed for the ordered phase of this model at finite temperatures. Some additional analyses of the model are provided, including the possibility of a metastable isotropic order, which aligns better with intuition.</description>
