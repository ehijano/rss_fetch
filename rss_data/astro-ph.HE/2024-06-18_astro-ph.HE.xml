      <title>Optical Variability Properties of Southern TESS Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of high-cadence, high-precision, optical light curves from the TESS satellite of 67 blazars in the southern sky. We provide descriptive flux statistics, power spectral density model parameters, and characteristic variability timescales. We find that only 15 BL Lacertae objects (BLLs) and 18 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) from the initial 26 and 41, respectively exhibit statistically-significant variability. We employ an adapted Power Spectral Response method to test the goodness of fit for the power spectral density function (PSD) to 3 power-law variant models. From our best-fitting description of the PSD, we extract the high-frequency power-spectral slopes and, if present, determine the significant bend or break in the model to identify characteristic timescales. We find no significant difference in the excess variance or rms-scatter between blazar subpopulations. We identify a linear rms-flux relation in ~69% of our sample, in which ~20% show a strong correlation. We find that both subpopulations of blazars show power spectral slope of $\alpha$~2 in which a broken power-law best fits 5 BLL &amp; 6 FSRQ and a bending power-law best fits 1 BLL &amp; 5 FSRQ. The shortest timescales of variability in each light curve range widely from minutes to weeks. Additionally, the objects' characteristic timescales range from ~0.8-8 days, consistent with the optical variability originating in the jet.</description>

      <title>Radiative Properties of Plasmoids and Plasmoid Mergers in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is often considered as the primary particle acceleration mechanism in a magnetized blazar zone environment. The majority of radiation in the reconnection layer comes from plasmoids and their mergers. In particular, plasmoid mergers can produce strong multi-wavelength flares and major variations in synchrotron polarization signatures. However, radiative properties of plasmoid mergers have not been well explored due to difficulties in tracking the merging processes. Here we use an image processing method that combines the magnetic vector potential and density to identify isolated and merging plasmoids. We find that this method can clearly distinguish radiation contributions from isolated plasmoids, merging plasmoids, and the primary current sheet of reconnection. This new method enables us to study the radiative properties of plasmoids and mergers statistically. Our results show that isolated plasmoids have similar emissivity regardless of their sizes, and they generally have nonzero polarization degree (PD) due to their quasi-circular shape. Flares due to plasmoid mergers have relative amplitudes that are anti-proportional to the size ratio of the plasmoids participating in the mergers. Finally, only mergers between plasmoids of comparable sizes (width ratio $\lesssim 5$) can lead to significant spectral hardening and polarization angle (PA) variations; the amplitude of the PA variations is between 0 and $180^{\circ}$ and has a mean value of $90^{\circ}$. Our analyses on 2D simulations can pave the way for future analyses and machine learning techniques on radiative properties of 3D magnetic reconnection simulations.</description>

      <title>Radiation RMHD accretion flows around spinning AGNs: a comparative study of MAD and SANE state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our study, we examine a 2D radiation, relativistic, magnetohydrodynamics (Rad-RMHD) accretion flows around a spinning supermassive black hole. We begin by setting an initial equilibrium torus around the black hole, with an embedded initial magnetic field inside the torus. The strength of the initial magnetic field is determined by the plasma beta parameter, which is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of the `magnetically arrested disc (MAD)' and `standard and normal evolution (SANE)' states. We observe that MAD state is possible for comparatively high initial magnetic field strength flow. Additionally, we also adopt a self-consistent two-temperature model to evaluate the luminosity and energy spectrum for our model. We observe that the total luminosity is mostly dominated by bremsstrahlung luminosity compared to the synchrotron luminosity due to the presence of highly dense torus. We also identify similar quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) for both MAD and SANE states based on power density spectrum analysis. Furthermore, our comparative study of the energy spectrum does not reveal any characteristic differences between MAD and SANE states. Lastly, we note that the MAD state is possible for both prograde and retrograde accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Accretion Geometry of GX 339-4 in the Hard State: AstroSat View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform broadband ($0.7-100$ keV) spectral analysis of five hard state observations of the low-mass back hole X-ray binary GX~339--4 taken by AstroSat during the rising phase of three outbursts from $2019$ to $2022$. We find that the outburst in 2021 was the only successful/full outburst, while the source was unable to make transition to the soft state during the other two outbursts in 2019 and 2022. Our spectral analysis employs two different model combinations, requiring two separate Comptonizing regions and their associated reflection components, and soft X-ray excess emission. The harder Comptonizing component dominates the overall bolometric luminosity, while the softer one remains relatively weak. Our spectral fits indicate that the disk evolves with the source luminosity, where the inner disk radius decreases with increasing luminosity. However, the disk remains substantially truncated throughout all the observations at the source luminosity of $\sim2-8\%\times$ of the Eddington luminosity. We note that our assumption of the soft X-ray excess emission as disk blackbody may not be realistic, and this kind of soft excess may arise due the non-homogeneity in the disk/corona geometry. Our temporal analysis deriving the power density spectra suggests that the break frequency increases with the source luminosity. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a consistency between the inner disk radii estimated from break frequency of the power density spectra and those obtained from the reflection modelling, supporting the truncated disk geometry in the hard state.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cosmic Voids on the propagation of TeV Gamma Rays and the Puzzle of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of gamma-ray burst GRB~221009A has attracted attention due to its record brightness and first-ever detection of $\gtrsim 10$ TeV $\gamma$ rays from a GRB. Despite being the second-nearest GRB ever detected, at a redshift of $z=0.151$, the distance is large enough for severe attenuation of $\gamma$-ray flux at these energies due to $\gamma\gamma\to e^\pm$ pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). Here, we investigate whether the presence of cosmic voids along the line of sight can significantly impact the detectability of very-high energy (VHE, $&gt;$ 100 GeV) gamma rays from distant sources. Notably, we find that the gamma-gamma opacity for VHE gamma rays can be reduced by approximately 10\% and up to 30\% at around 13 TeV, the highest-energy photon detected from GRB~221009A, for intervening cosmic voids along the line-of-sight with a combined radius of 110 Mpc, typically found from voids catalogs, and 250 Mpc, respectively. This reduction is substantially higher for TeV photons compared to GeV photons, attributable to the broader target photon spectrum that TeV photons interact with. This finding implies that VHE photons are more susceptible to variations in the EBL spectrum, especially in regions dominated by cosmic voids. Our study sheds light on the detection of $\gtrsim 10$ TeV gamma rays from GRB 221009A in particular, and on the detection of extragalactic VHE sources in general.</description>

      <title>X-Ray spectral and temporal properties of LMXB 4U 1608-52- observed with AstroSat and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from a detailed study of the neutron star X-ray binary, 4U 1608-52 using observations with {\it AstroSat} (LAXPC/SXT) and {\it NICER} during its 2016 and 2020 outbursts. The 0.7--20.0 keV spectra could be well described with the disk blackbody and thermal Comptonization model. The best-fitting inner disk temperature is $\sim$ 1 keV and radius { $\sim$ 22.17$^{+2.57}_{-2.38}$--27.19$^{+2.03}_{-1.85}$} km and no significant evolution was observed in the disk radius after performing flux and time-resolved spectroscopy. We used a multi-Lorentzian approach to fit the power density spectra and obtained broad-band noise variability. We estimated the energy-dependent fractional root mean square and time-lag of the broad-band noise, and these variations are quantitatively modelled as being due to the coherent variation of the disk emission and the coronal heating rate. Thus, the rapid temporal modeling is consistent with the longer term spectral evolution where the inner disk radius does not vary, and instead the variations can be attributed to accretion rate variations which changes the inner disk temperature and the coronal heating rate.</description>

      <title>Propagation of GRB Relativistic Jets in AGN Disks and Its Implication for GRB Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion disks of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) harboring in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are considered to be an ideal site for producing different types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The detectability of these GRB phenomena hidden in AGN disks is highly dependent on the dynamical evolution of the GRB relativistic jets. By investigating the reverse and forward shock dynamics due to the interaction between the jets and AGN disk material, we find that the relativistic jets can successfully break out from the disks only for a sufficiently high luminosity and a long enough duration. In comparison, relatively normal GRB jets are inclined to be choked in the disks, unless the GRBs occur near an SMBH with relatively low mass (e.g., $\sim 10^6M_{\odot}$). For the choked jets, unlike normal GRB prompt and afterglow emission, we can only expect to detect emission from the forward shock when the shock is very close to the edge of the disks, i.e., the shock breakout emission and subsequent cooling of the shock.</description>

      <title>Testing unified models for the origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos:Multimessenger approaches with x-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unified models of astrophysical sources to account for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and high-energy cosmic neutrinos with energies greater than 100 TeV have been discussed. Based on model-independent arguments, we argue that if the photomeson production is the dominant mechanism, the most probable candidate sources are x-ray transient objects, allowing for the semi-transparency for the photomeson production. We develop a generic model of high-energy neutrino emitters accompanied by x-ray emission, and present how multimessenger observations can place significant constraints on the source parameters that characterize the common sources of neutrinos and UHECRs, such as the cosmic-ray loading factor. The requirements of UHECR acceleration, escape, and energetics further constrain the magnetic field and the bulk Lorentz factor of the sources. The resulting bounds provide diagnoses of the unified models, which demonstrates the importance of current and future x-ray facilities such as MAXI and Einstein Probe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our new model for the description of the very high energy Galactic gamma-ray emission based on a discrete injection of cosmic rays by individual sources. We investigate the morphology of the very high energy gamma-ray sky, the detectability of cosmic-ray sources and the clumpiness of the diffuse gamma-ray flux, assuming two different scenarios for cosmic-ray propagation. Namely, a standard isotropic and homogeneous diffusion process and an isotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion process. We notably formulate a possible explanation to the small number of hadronic PeVatrons recently detected by LHAASO. In the case of the inhomogeneous diffusion process, we constrain the number of hadronic PeVatrons to be small. Finally, we give an argument that may explain the discrepancy between the interstellar gas density distribution and the very high energy diffuse gamma-ray flux.</description>

      <title>Magnetospheric origin of a fast radio burst constrained using scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are micro-to-millisecond duration radio transients that originate mostly from extragalactic distances. The emission mechanism responsible for these high luminosity, short duration transients remains debated. The models are broadly grouped into two classes: physical processes that occur within close proximity to a central engine; and central engines that release energy which moves to large radial distances and subsequently interacts with surrounding media producing radio waves. The expected emission region sizes are notably different between these two types of models. FRB emission size constraints can therefore be used to distinguish between these competing models and inform on the physics responsible. Here we present the measurement of two mutually coherent scintillation scales in the frequency spectrum of FRB 20221022A: one originating from a scattering screen located within the Milky Way, and the second originating from a scattering screen located within its host galaxy or local environment. We use the scattering media as an astrophysical lens to constrain the size of the lateral emission region, $R_{\star\mathrm{obs}} \lesssim 3\times10^{4}$ km. We find that this is inconsistent with the expected emission sizes for the large radial distance models, and is more naturally explained with an emission process that operates within or just beyond the magnetosphere of a central compact object. Recently, FRB 20221022A was found to exhibit an S-shaped polarisation angle swing, supporting a magnetospheric emission process. The scintillation results presented in this work independently support this conclusion, while highlighting scintillation as a useful tool in our understanding of FRB emission physics and progenitors.</description>

      <title>No evidence for a dip in the binary black hole mass spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar models indicate that the core compactness of a star, which is a common proxy for its explodability in a supernova, does not increase monotonically with the star's mass. Rather, the core compactness dips sharply over a range of carbon-oxygen core masses; this range may be somewhat sensitive to the star's metallicity and evolutionary history. Stars in this compactness dip are expected to experience supernovae leaving behind neutron stars, whereas stars on either side of this range are expected to form black holes. This results in a hypothetical mass range in which black holes should seldom form. Quantitatively, when applied to binary stripped stars, these models predict a dearth of binary black holes with component masses $\approx 10 M_\odot - 15 M_\odot$. The population of gravitational-wave signals indicates weak evidence for a dip in the distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes near $\approx 10 M_\odot - 12 M_\odot$. This feature could be linked to the hypothetical component mass gap described above, but this interpretation depends on what assumptions are made of the binaries' mass ratios. Here, we directly probe the distribution of binary black hole component masses to look for evidence of a gap. We find no evidence for this feature using data from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3). If this gap does exist in nature, we find that it is unlikely to be resolvable by the end of the current (fourth) LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing run.</description>

      <title>Binary population synthesis of the Galactic canonical pulsar population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. We use the rapid binary population synthesis suite COMPAS to model the Galactic population of canonical pulsars. We account for both radio and gamma-ray selection effects, as well as the motion of pulsars in the Galactic potential due to natal kicks. We compare our models to the catalogs of pulsars detected in the radio, and those detected in gamma-rays by Fermi, and find broad agreement with both populations. We reproduce the observed ratio of radio-loud to radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. We further examine the possibility of low spin-down luminosity (Edot) pulsars emitting weak, unpulsed gamma-ray emission and attempt to match this with recent stacking results. We demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the latitude of a pulsar and its Edot arises due to natal kicks imparted to pulsars at birth, assuming that all pulsars are born in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Structured Jet Model for Multiwavelength Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT 2022cmc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT 2022cmc is a recently documented tidal disruption event (TDE) that exhibits a luminous jet, accompanied by fast-declining X-ray and long-lasting radio/millimeter emission. Motivated by the distinct spectral and temporal signatures between X-ray and radio observations, we propose a multizone model involving relativistic jets with different Lorentz factors. We systematically study the evolution of the faster and slower jets in an external density profile, considering the continuous energy injection rate associated with the time-dependent accretion rates before and after the mass fallback time. We investigate time-dependent multiwavelength emission from both the forward shock and reverse shock regions of the fast and slow jets, in a self-consistent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that the energy injection rate can significantly impact the jet evolution and subsequently influence the lightcurves. We find that the X-ray spectra and lightcurves can be described by the electron synchrotron emission from the reverse shock of the faster jet, in which the late-time X-ray upper limits, extending to 400 days after the disruption, could be interpreted as the jet break steepening. Meanwhile, the radio observations can be interpreted as a result of synchrotron emissions from the forward shock region of the slower jet. We also discuss prospects for testing the model with current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Origin of the strong sodium absorption of the lensed supernova 2016geu at z=0.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of strong sodium absorption, which has been observed for a few nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), remains elusive. Here we analyse two high-signal-to-noise, intermediate-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra at epochs $+$18 and $+$27 days past peak brightness of the strongly lensed and multiply-imaged Type Ia SN 2016geu which exploded at a redshift of $z = 0.4$. We show that SN 2016geu exhibits very strong, multiple Na I and Ca II absorption lines with a large total Na I D restframe equivalent width of 5.2 $\pm$ 0.2 A, among the highest ever detected for a SN Ia and similar to only a handful of nearby SNe Ia with extraordinary large Na I D EWs. The absorption system is time-invariant and extends over a large velocity span $\sim$ 250 km s$^{-1}$. The majority of the absorption is blueshifted relative to the strongest component, while there are both blueshifted and redshifted components relative to the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The column density ratios and widths of the absorption lines indicate that the absorption likely arises from a combination of interstellar dusty molecular clouds and circumgalactic in- and outflowing material, rather than circumstellar matter around the SN.</description>

      <title>A systematically-selected sample of luminous, long-duration, ambiguous nuclear transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for luminous, long-duration ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs) similar to the unprecedented discovery of the extreme, ambiguous event AT2021lwx with a $&gt;150$ d rise time and luminosity $10^{45.7}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We use the Lasair transient broker to search Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data for transients lasting more than one year and exhibiting smooth declines. Our search returns 59 events, seven of which we classify as ANTs assumed to be driven by accretion onto supermassive black holes. We propose the remaining 52 are stochastic variability from regular supermassive black hole accretion rather than distinct transients. We supplement the seven ANTs with three nuclear transients in ZTF that fail the light curve selection but have clear single flares and spectra that do not resemble typical AGN. All but one of these 10 ANTs have a mid-infrared flare from an assumed dust echo, implying the ubiquity of dust around the black holes giving rise to ANTs. No events are more luminous than AT2021lwx, but one (ZTF19aamrjar) has twice the duration and a higher integrated energy release. On the other extreme, ZTF20abodaps reaches a luminosity close to AT2021lwx with a rise time $&lt;20$ d and that fades smoothly in $&gt;600$ d. We define a portion of rise-time versus flare amplitude space that selects ANTs with $\sim50$ per cent purity against variable active galactic nuclei. We calculate a volumetric rate of $\gtrsim 3\times10^{-11}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the events being caused by tidal disruptions of intermediate and high-mass stars.</description>

      <title>AsterX: a new open-source GPU-accelerated GRMHD code for dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AsterX, a novel open-source, GPU-accelerated, fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code designed for dynamic spacetimes in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and tailored for exascale computing. We utilize block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) through CarpetX, the new driver for the Einstein Toolkit, which is built on AMReX, a software framework for massively parallel applications. AsterX employs the Valencia formulation for GRMHD, coupled with the 'Z4c' formalism for spacetime evolution, while incorporating high resolution shock capturing schemes to accurately handle the hydrodynamics. AsterX has undergone rigorous testing in both static and dynamic spacetime, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and agreement with other codes in literature. Benchmarking the code through scaling tests on OLCF's Frontier supercomputer, we demonstrate a weak scaling efficiency of about 67%-77% on 4096 nodes compared to an 8-node performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their spectral energy distributions can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes eight LRDs from the CEERS survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) at 0.53 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that the SEDs of all the LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with the best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 40% and 85%. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by $\sim 2$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

      <title>Getting More Out of Black Hole Superradiance: a Statistically Rigorous Approach to Ultralight Boson Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) superradiance can provide strong constraints on the properties of ultralight bosons (ULBs). Since most of the previous work has focused on the theoretical predictions, here we investigate the most suitable statistical framework to constrain ULB masses and self-interactions. We argue that a Bayesian approach provides a clear statistical interpretation, deals with limitations regarding the reproducibility of existing BH analyses, incorporates the full information from BH data, and allows us to include additional nuisance parameters or to perform hierarchical modelling with BH populations in the future. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using mass and spin posterior samples for the X-ray binary BH M33 X-7 and, for the first time in this context, the supermassive BH IRAS 09149-6206. We explain the differences to existing ULB constraints in the literature and illustrate the effects of various assumptions about the superradiance process (equilibrium regime vs cloud collapse, higher occupation levels). As a result, our procedure yields the most rigorous ULB constraints available in the literature, with important implications for the QCD axion and axion-like particles. We encourage all groups analysing BH data to publish likelihood functions or posterior samples as supplementary material to facilitate this type of analysis.</description>

      <title>Bursty Star Formation in Dwarfs is Sensitive to Numerical Choices in Supernova Feedback Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the {\small SMUGGLE} stellar feedback model, we compute idealized simulations of a $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{10} \, \msun$ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of $\sim 3$. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the non-linear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments: Decision Trees versus Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of Dark Matter (DM) remains a significant challenge in particle physics. This study exploits advanced machine learning models to improve detection capabilities of liquid xenon time projection chamber experiments, utilizing state-of-the-art transformers alongside traditional methods like Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate various data representations and find that simplified feature representations, particularly corrected S1 and S2 signals, retain critical information for classification. Our results show that while transformers offer promising performance, simpler models like XGBoost can achieve comparable results with optimal data representations. We also derive exclusion limits in the cross-section versus DM mass parameter space, showing minimal differences between XGBoost and the best performing deep learning models. The comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches provides a valuable reference for future experiments by guiding the choice of models and data representations to maximize detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Dampening Long-Period Doppler Shift Oscillations using Deep Machine Learning Techniques in the Solar Network and Internetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the Doppler shift at different wavelengths in the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) solar spectrum and implements a comprehensive consideration of Doppler velocity oscillations in the IRIS channels. This comprehensive consideration reveals a propagating periodic perturbation in a large number of chromosphere and transition region (TR) bright points (BPs). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the longitudinal oscillations with damping in BPs using comprehensive consideration of the Doppler velocity at various wavelengths. The phenomena of attenuation in the red and blue Doppler shifts of the solar wavelength range were seen several times during the experiments. We utilized deep learning techniques to examine the statistical properties of damping in network and internetwork BPs, as well as active, quiet areas, and coronal hole areas. Our results revealed varying damping rates across different regions, with 80 percent of network BPs exhibiting damping in quiet areas and 72 in coronal hole areas. In active areas, the figure approached 33. For internetwork BPs, the values were 65, 54, and 63 percent for quiet areas, coronal hole areas, and active regions, respectively. The damping rate in active regions is twice as high at Internetwork's BPs. The damping components in this study were computed, and the findings show that the damping at all points is underdamped. The observed damping process suggests the propagation and leaking of energetic waves out of TR bright points, potentially contributing to the energy transport from the bright magnetic footpoints to the upper chromosphere, transition region, and corona.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

      <title>Isospin QCD as a laboratory for dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD with the isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, is a useful laboratory to delineate the microphysics in dense QCD. To study the quark-hadron-continuity we use a quark-meson model that interpolates hadronic and quark matter physics at microscopic level. The equation of state is dominated by mesons at low density but taken over by quarks at high density. We extend our previous studies with two-flavors to the three-flavors case to study the impact of the strangeness which may be brought by kaons $(K_+, K_0) = (u\bar{s}, s\bar{d})$ and the U$_A$(1) anomaly. In the normal phase the excitation energies of kaons are reduced by $\mu_I$ in the same way as hyperons in nuclear matter at finite baryon chemical potential. Once pions condense, kaon excitation energies increases as $\mu_I$ does. Moreover, strange quarks become more massive through the U$_A$(1) coupling to the condensed pions. Hence at zero and low temperature the strange hadrons and quarks are highly suppressed. The previous findings in two-flavor models, sound speed peak, negative trace anomaly, gaps insensitve to $\mu_I$, persist in our three-flavor model and remain consistent with the lattice results to $\mu_I \sim 1$ GeV. We discuss the non-perturbative power corrections and quark saturation effects as important ingredients to understand the crossover equations of state measured on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the scalar radiation emitted by a source interacting with a nonminimally coupled scalar field in four-dimensional Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime. We obtain the emission probability using quantum field theory in curved spacetimes at tree level. We find that the source emits synchrotron-type radiation for orbits near the photon sphere for all allowed values of the parameters. We also find that the emitted power strongly depends on the coupling to the curvature scalar. In particular, the previously observed enhancement in the contribution of lower multipoles to the emitted power in this spacetime with minimal coupling is absent when conformal coupling is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superradiant growth of massive vector fields in rotating black hole spacetimes has garnered significant attention in recent literature. However, the majority of these studies overlook the influence of a cosmological constant, which likely constitutes the primary energy content of our universe. In this paper, we extend recent research by incorporating a cosmological constant into the Einstein+Proca system and numerically evolving the resulting equations of motion. Utilizing the newly released GRBoondi numerical relativity code, designed specifically for the numerical evolution of (generalized) Proca fields, we discover that parameters causing a growing instability in the $\Lambda = 0$ scenario transition to a decaying state when $\Lambda &gt; 0$. This results in a more intriguing phenomenology. These simulations pave the way for future full Einstein+Proca simulations to explore the secular decay of the resultant cloud from gravitational emission.</description>

      <title>Multi-spectral sirens: Gravitational-wave cosmology with (multi-) sub-populations of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic expansion rate can be directly measured with gravitational waves (GWs) of the compact binary mergers, by jointly constraining the mass function of the population and the cosmological model via the so called spectral sirens. Such a method relies on the features in the mass functions, which may originate from some individual sub-populations, and hence become blurred/indistinct due to the superposition of different sub-populations. In this work we propose a novel approach to constrain the cosmic expansion rate with sub-populations of GW events, named multi-spectral sirens. We illustrate the advantage of the multi-spectral sirens compared to the traditional spectral sirens by simulation with mock data. The application of this approach to the GWTC-3 data yields $H_0=73.25^{+29.87}_{-25.55}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (median and symmetric 68.3\% credible level). The incorporation of the bright standard siren GW170817 with a uniform prior in $ [10,200] ~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ gives $H_0=72.38^{+15.03}_{-9.13}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (68.3\% confidence level), corresponding to an improvement of $\sim28\%$ with respect to the measurement from sole GW170817.</description>

      <title>ExaGRyPE: Numerical General Relativity Solvers Based upon the Hyperbolic PDEs Solver Engine ExaHyPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ExaGRyPE describes a suite of solvers for numerical relativity, based upon ExaHyPE 2, the second generation of our Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine. The presented generation of ExaGRyPE solves the Einstein equations in the CCZ4 formulation under a 3+1 foliation and focuses on black hole spacetimes. It employs a block-structured Cartesian grid carrying a higher-order order Finite Difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement, it facilitates massive parallelism combining message passing, domain decomposition and task parallelism, and it supports the injection of particles into the grid as data probes or tracers. We introduce the ExaGRyPE-specific building blocks within ExaHyPE 2, and discuss its software architecture and compute-n-feel:
  For this, we formalize the creation of any specific simulation with ExaGRyPE as a sequence of lowering operations, where abstract logical tasks are successively broken into finer tasks until we obtain an abstraction level that can be mapped onto a C++ executable. The overall program logic is fully specified via a domain-specific Python interface, we map this logic onto a more detailed set of numerical tasks, subsequently lower this representation onto technical tasks that the underlying ExaHyPE engine uses to parallelize the application, before eventually the technical tasks are mapped onto task graphs including the actual PDE term evaluations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and so forth. We end up with a rigorous separation of concerns which shields ExaGRyPE users from technical details and hence simplifies the development of novel physical models. We present the simulations and data for the gauge wave, static single black holes and rotating binary black hole systems, demonstrating that the code base is mature and usable. However, we also uncover domain-specific numerical challenges that need further study by the community in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers have been studied in great detail, no comprehensive simulation study of the neutron component is available. This is related to the complexity of neutron transport processes that is typically not treated in standard simulation tools. In this work we use the Monte Carlo simulation package Fluka to study the production and the transport of neutrons in extensive air showers over the full range of neutron energies, extending down to thermal neutrons. The importance of different neutron production mechanisms and their impact on predicted neutron distributions in energy, lateral distance, atmospheric depth, and arrival time are discussed. In addition, the dependencies of the predictions on the properties of the primary particle are studied. The results are compared to the equivalent distributions of muons, which serve as reference.</description>

      <title>Mapping the AMS-02 and CALET Data onto the Source Spectra and Residence Times of Galactic Cosmic Rays</title>

Abstract: The recent measurements of the spectral intensities of cosmic-ray nuclei have suggested that the ratio of Boron to Carbon nuclei, $R(E)$, comprises two components, $R_1(E)$ which carries all of the energy dependence and the other $R_A$, a constant independent of energy per nucleon. This finding supports the earlier theoretical expectations and results of gamma-ray astronomy that one of these components is attributable to spallation in a cocoon like region surrounding the sources and the other in the general interstellar medium before cosmic rays leak away from the Galaxy. A new model-independent way of analyzing cosmic-ray spectra is presented here to shed light on the recent findings: Imposing the single constraint that the source function of B nuclei is minimal we use a cascade of rate equations to map point-by-point the observed cosmic ray spectra of p, B, C, O and Fe on to their source spectra and the two life-times of cosmic rays $\tau_G$ in the Galaxy and $\tau_S$ in the cocoons surrounding the sources. The model independent results show that the appropriate choice is $\tau_S(E)$ is responsible for $R_1(E)$ and the source spectra are power laws with indices of $\sim-2.7$.</description>

      <title>CONGRuENTS (COsmic-ray, Neutrino, Gamma-ray and Radio Non-Thermal Spectra). II. Population-level correlations between galactic infrared, radio, and {\gamma}-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05693</link>

Abstract: Galaxies obey a number of empirical correlations between their radio, {\gamma}-ray, and infrared emission, but the physical origins of these correlations remain uncertain. Here we use the CONGRuENTS model for broadband non-thermal emission from star-forming galaxies, which self-consistently calculates energy-dependent transport and non-thermal emission from cosmic ray hadrons and leptons, to predict radio and {\gamma}-ray emission for a synthetic galaxy population with properties drawn from a large deep-field survey. We show that our synthetic galaxies reproduce observed relations such as the FIR-radio correlation, the FIR-{\gamma} correlation, and the distribution of radio spectral indices, and we use the model to explain the physical origins of these relations. Our results show that the FIR-radio correlation arises because the amount of cosmic ray electron power ultimately radiated as synchrotron emission varies only weakly with galaxy star formation rate as a result of the constraints imposed on gas properties by hydrostatic balance and turbulent dynamo action; the same physics dictates the extent of proton calorimetry in different galaxies, and thus sets the FIR-{\gamma}-ray correlation. We further show that galactic radio spectral indices result primarily from competition between thermal free-free emission and energy-dependent loss of cosmic ray electrons to bremsstrahlung and escape into galactic halos, with shaping of the spectrum by inverse Compton, synchrotron, and ionisation processes typically playing a sub-dominant role. In addition to explaining existing observations, we use our analysis to predict a heretofore unseen correlation between the curvature of galaxies' radio spectra and their pion-driven {\gamma}-ray emission, a prediction that will be testable with upcoming facilities.</description>

      <title>Very Local Impact on the Spectrum of Cosmic-Ray Nuclei below 100 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of primary and secondary CR spectra, their arrival directions, and our improved knowledge of the magnetic field geometry around the heliosphere allow us to set a bound on the distance beyond which a puzzling 10-TeV ``bump'' and certain related spectral features \emph{cannot} originate. The sharpness of the spectral breaks associated with the bump, the abrupt change of the CR intensity across the local magnetic equator ($90^{\circ}$ pitch angle), and the similarity between the primary and secondary CR spectral patterns point to a local reacceleration of the bump particles out of the background CRs. We argue that, owing to a steep preexisting CR spectrum, a nearby shock may generate such a bump by boosting particle rigidity by a mere factor of $\sim$1.5 in the range below 50 TV. Reaccelerated particles below $\sim$0.5 TV are convected with the interstellar medium flow and do not reach the Sun. The particles above this rigidity then form the bump. This single universal process is responsible for the observed spectral features of all CR nuclei, primary and secondary, in the rigidity range below 100 TV. We propose that one viable candidate is the system of shocks associated with $\epsilon$ Eridani star at 3.2 pc of the Sun, which is well aligned with the direction of the local magnetic field. Other shocks, such as old supernova shells, may produce a similar effect. We provide a simple formula that reproduces the spectra of all CR species with only three parameters uniquely derived from the CR proton data. We show how our formalism predicts helium, boron, carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra. Our model thus unifies all the CR spectral features observed below 50 TV.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the potential for dark matter annihilation within brown dwarfs, investigating an unconventional mechanism for neutrino production. Motivated by the efficient accumulation of dark matter particles in brown dwarfs through scattering interactions, we focus on a mass range above 10 GeV, considering dark matter annihilation channels $\chi \chi \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu} \nu \bar{\nu}$ through long-lived mediators. Using the projected sensitivity of IceCube Generation 2, we assess the detection capability of the local population of brown dwarfs within 20 pc and exclude dark matter-nucleon scattering with cross-sections as low as a few multiples of $10^{-36}~\rm cm^{2}$.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic double-peaked stripped-envelope SN 2023aew</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2023aew and our findings on its remarkable properties. This event, initially resembling a Type IIb supernova (SN), rebrightens dramatically $\sim$90 d after the first peak, at which time its spectrum transforms into that of a SN Ic. The slowly evolving spectrum specifically resembles a post-peak SN~Ic with relatively low line velocities even during the second rise. The second peak, reached 119 d after the first peak, is both more luminous ($M_r = -18.75\pm0.04$ mag) and much broader than those of typical SNe Ic. Blackbody fits to SN 2023aew indicate that the photosphere shrinks almost throughout its observed evolution, and the second peak is caused by an increasing temperature. Bumps in the light curve after the second peak suggest interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM) or possibly accretion. We consider several scenarios for producing the unprecedented behavior of SN 2023aew. Two separate SNe, either unrelated or from the same binary system, require either an incredible coincidence or extreme fine-tuning. A pre-SN eruption followed by a SN requires an extremely powerful, SN-like eruption (consistent with $\sim$10$^{51}$ erg) and is also disfavored. We therefore consider only the first peak a true stellar explosion. The observed evolution is difficult to reproduce if the second peak is dominated by interaction with a distant CSM shell. A delayed internal heating mechanism is more likely, but emerging embedded interaction with a CSM disk should be accompanied by CSM lines in the spectrum, which are not observed, and is difficult to hide long enough. A magnetar central engine requires a delayed onset to explain the long time between the peaks. Delayed fallback accretion onto a black hole may present the most promising scenario, but we cannot definitively establish the power source.</description>

      <title>Late-time Radio Flares in Tidal Disruption Events</title>

Abstract: Radio monitoring unveiled late (hundreds to a thousand days) radio flares in a significant fraction of tidal disruption events. We propose that these late-time radio flares are a natural outcome if the surrounding density profile flattens outside the Bondi radius. At the Bondi radius, the outflow is optically thin (above a few GHz) to synchrotron self-absorption. As more and more material is swept up, the radio emission rises asymptotically as $\propto t^3$ until the outflow begins to decelerate. A Detection of such a rise and a late-time maximum constrains the black hole mass and the mass and energy of the radio-emitting outflow. We show that this model can give reasonable fits to some observed light curves, leading to reasonable estimates of the black hole and outflow masses. We also find that the slope of the density profile within the Bondi radius determines whether an early-time ($\sim10^2\,\rm days$) radio peak exists.</description>

      <title>On the Interacting/Active Lifetime of Supernova Fallback Disk around Isolated Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fallback disk model is widely accepted to explain long-period neutron stars (NSs) which can't be simulated by magnetic dipole radiation. However, no confirmed detection of disk was found from the newly discovered long period pulsars GLEAM-X 162759.5-523504.3, GPM J1839-10 and the known slowest isolated NSs 1E 161348-5055. This might be that the disks have either been in noninteracting/inactive state where its emission is too weak to be detected or have been disrupted. In this work, we conduct simulations to examine the lifetime of supernova fallback disks around isolated neutron stars. We assume that the disk's mass varies in a self-similar way and its interaction with the NS occurs only in interacting/active state. Our results reveal that nearly all the interacting lifetimes for the disk are shorter than 0.1 Myr while the existence lifetimes are considerably longer.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quasinormal mode detectability with next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of a binary black hole merger event, the gravitational wave signal emitted by the remnant black hole is modeled as a superposition of damped sinusoids known as quasinormal modes. While the dominant quasinormal modes originating from linear black hole perturbation theory have been studied extensively in this post-merger "ringdown" phase, more accurate models of ringdown radiation include the nonlinear modes arising from higher-order perturbations of the remnant black hole spacetime. We explore the detectability of quadratic quasinormal modes with both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. We quantify how predictions of the quadratic mode detectability depend on the quasinormal mode starting times. We then calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of quadratic modes for several detectors and binary black hole populations, focusing on the ($220\times220$) mode - i.e., on the quadratic term sourced by the square of the linear $(220)$ mode. For the events with the loudest quadratic mode signal-to-noise ratios, we additionally compute statistical errors on the mode parameters in order to further ascertain the distinguishability of the quadratic mode from the linear quasinormal modes. The astrophysical models used in this paper suggest that while the quadratic mode may be detectable in at most a few events with ground-based detectors, the prospects for detection with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are more optimistic.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction in weakly magnetized black holes: can the tail term be ignored in the strong field regime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>Realistic models of general-relativistic differentially rotating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-relativistic equilibria of differentially rotating stars are expected in a number of astrophysical scenarios, from core-collapse supernovae to the remnant of binary neutron-star mergers. The latter, in particular, have been the subject of extensive studies where they were modeled with a variety of laws of differential rotation with varying degree of realism. Starting from accurate and fully general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron-star mergers with various equations of state and mass ratios, we establish the time when the merger remnant has reached a quasi-stationary equilibrium and extract in this way realistic profiles of differential rotation. This allows us to explore how well traditional laws reproduce such differential-rotation properties and to derive new laws of differential rotation that better match the numerical data in the low-density Keplerian regions of the remnant. In this way, we have obtained a novel and somewhat surprising result: the dynamical stability line to quasi-radial oscillations computed from the turning-point criterion can have a slope that is not necessarily negative with respect to the central rest-mass density, as previously found with traditional differential-rotation laws. Indeed, for stellar models reproducing well the properties of the merger remnants, the slope is actually positive, thus reflecting remnants with angular momentum at large distances from the rotation axis, and hence with cores having higher central rest-mass densities and slower rotation rates.</description>
