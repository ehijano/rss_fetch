      <title>Joint Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling in Wavelet Coefficient Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attenuation correction (AC) is necessary for accurate activity quantification in positron emission tomography (PET). Conventional reconstruction methods typically rely on attenuation maps derived from a co-registered computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, this additional scan may complicate the imaging workflow, introduce misalignment artifacts and increase radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose a joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation (JRAA) approach that eliminates the need for auxiliary anatomical imaging by relying solely on emission data. This framework combines wavelet diffusion model (WDM) and diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) to reconstruct fully three-dimensional (3-D) data. Experimental results show our method outperforms maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) and MLAA with UNet-based post processing, and yields high-quality noise-free reconstructions across various count settings when time-of-flight (TOF) information is available. It is also able to reconstruct non-TOF data, although the reconstruction quality significantly degrades in low-count (LC) conditions, limiting its practical effectiveness in such settings. This approach represents a step towards stand-alone PET imaging by reducing the dependence on anatomical modalities while maintaining quantification accuracy, even in low-count scenarios when TOF information is available.</description>

      <title>Design of a Wearable Parallel Electrical Impedance Imaging System for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wireless wearable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system has been developed using the AD5933 for real-time lung respiration imaging. The system uses a current injection method tailored to the human body's impedance characteristics. It applies a voltage excitation and measures the resulting current as the voltage passes through the body. Additionally, measures are taken to suppress the effects of parasitic capacitance, which can lead to signal oscillations and leakage currents. Additionally, to improve data acquisition speed, five AD5933 units are used for parallel measurements, with multiple measures taken to ensure high synchronization during the parallel acquisition process. The results demonstrate conductivity images generated from the EIT system, with data collected from a water tank, human lungs during respiration, and a human calf at rest, confirming that this portable EIT system can measure biological tissues with high precision and low cost.</description>

      <title>Patient-specific forecasting method for the functionality of a balloon-expandable stent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to develop a method to reduce the time cost and complexity of balloon expandable stent simulations in cardiovascular stenting procedures for Peripheral Artery Disease. The study uses stereoscopic images to construct a cardiovascular stent and validate its mechanical response through Finite Element testing. A 3D model of the curved common femoral artery was constructed using Computed Tomography of a patient with Critical Limb Ischemia. The fatigue life cycles of the stent were estimated considering sinusoidal cyclic loading. The crimping process has a negligible influence on the mechanical response, with recoil and foreshortening percentages remaining static with increasing stent rings. The numerical results indicate the biomechanical influence of stent placement in a realistic vessel and compare it with literature.</description>

      <title>Ring artifacts correction method in x-ray computed tomography based on stripe classification and removal in sinogram images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely utilized in the medical, industrial, and other fields to nondestructively generate three-dimensional structural images of objects. However, CT images are often affected by various artifacts, with ring artifacts being a common occurrence that significantly compromises image quality and subsequent structural interpretation. In this study, a ring artifact correction method based on stripe classification and removal in sinogram images was proposed. The proposed method classifies ring artifacts into single stripes and multiple stripes, which were identified and eliminated using median filtering and multiphase decomposition, respectively. A novel algorithm combining median filtering, polyphase decomposition and median filtering was further developed to eliminate all forms of stripes simultaneously and effectively. The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through both simulated and experimental CT data. The study provides a novel perspective and integrated approach to addressing ring artifacts in X-ray CT. It will be of significant illuminating to a diverse readership, including radiologists, clinical researchers, and industrial scientists.</description>

      <title>Technical recommendation on multiplex MR elastography for tomographic mapping of abdominal stiffness with a focus on the pancreas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: MR elastography (MRE) offers valuable mechanical tissue characterization, however, in deep abdominal organs like the pancreas conventional single-driver, single-frequency approaches often fail. This study evaluates whether multiplex MRE using multiple drivers and vibration frequencies can overcome these limitations.
  Methods: This study used single-shot spin-echo MRE in 18 healthy volunteers targeting the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen. Each healthy volunteer underwent 16 MRE examinations with different sets of four vibration frequencies (30-60 Hz) and four driver combinations, and an additional null experiment without vibrations. Further, a cohort of 14 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were retrospectively assessed. The quality of shear-wave fields and stiffness maps was assessed by displacement amplitudes and image sharpness.
  Results: In healthy volunteers, abdominal coverage with displacement amplitudes above the pre-determined noise level of 4 {\mu}m varied between MRE configurations: 24.2% ([0.0%-56.2%], single-driver, 60 Hz), 66.9% ([24.8%-97.7%], single-driver, 30-60 Hz), 70.2% ([0.0%-92.5%], multi-driver, 60 Hz) and 99.9% ([89.4%-100%], multi-driver, 30-60 Hz). In the pancreas, &gt;60% coverage was achieved in all subjects using four drivers and multiple frequencies. This was achieved in only 2/18 subjects using single-driver/single-frequency MRE. Patients with PDAC had 99.1% [91.4%-100%] coverage in the pancreas and 96.3% [63.1%-100%] abdominal coverage (multi-driver, 30-60 Hz).
  Conclusion: MRE with four drivers and multiple vibration frequencies between 30-60 Hz enables tomographic mapping of tissue stiffness across the entire abdomen, including the pancreas. Multiplex MRE offers a promising approach for generating detailed images of abdominal stiffness, potentially enhancing clinical diagnostics for abdominal and pancreatic diseases.</description>

      <title>Microtubule polymerization generates microtentacles important in circulating tumor cell invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have crucial roles in the spread of tumors during metastasis. A decisive step is the extravasation of CTCs from the blood stream or lymph system, which depends on the ability of cells to attach to vessel walls. Recent work suggests that such adhesion is facilitated by microtubule (MT)-based membrane protrusions called microtentacles (McTNs). However, how McTNs facilitate such adhesion and how MTs can generate protrusions in CTCs remain unclear. By combining fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments and simulations we show that polymerization of MTs provides the main driving force for McTN formation, whereas the contribution of MTs sliding with respect to each other is minimal. Further, the forces exerted on the McTN tip result in curvature, as the MTs are anchored at the other end in the MT organizing center. When approaching vessel walls, McTN curvature is additionally influenced by the adhesion strength between the McTN and wall. Moreover, increasing McTN length, reducing its bending rigidity, or strengthening adhesion enhances the cell-wall contact area and, thus, promotes cell attachment to vessel walls. Our results demonstrate a link between the formation and function of McTNs, which may provide new insight into metastatic cancer diagnosis and therapy.</description>

      <title>PolyPose: Localizing Deformable Anatomy in 3D from Sparse 2D X-ray Images using Polyrigid Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.</description>

      <title>Challenges and perspectives in using multimodal imaging techniques to advance the understanding of fish intestinal microvilli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary function of intestinal microvilli is to increase the surface area of the intestinal lining to maximize nutrient absorption. Despite its importance to the fish health, the small size and dense footprint of microvilli hinders its investigation and necessitates the need of advanced microscopy methods for its visualization. Characterization of the microvilli using super-resolution microscopy provides insights into their structural organization, spatial distribution, and surface properties. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of different optical, electron and force microscopy methods for analysis of fish microvilli. The super-resolution optical microscopy methods used are 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and fluorescence fluctuation microscopy. We also visualized the intestinal microvilli in fish using diffraction-limited optical microscopy methods including confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, label-free microscopy methods, such as quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) and bright-field imaging, were also employed. To obtain ultra-high resolution, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate a systematic comparison of these microscopy techniques in resolving and quantifying microvilli features, ranging from 1-2 {\mu}m structural morphology to 10-100 nm surface details. Our results highlight the advantages, limitations, and complementary nature of each method in capturing microvilli characteristics across different scales. These techniques are used for super-resolution and high-resolution imaging of Atlantic salmon microvilli gastrointestinal tract.</description>

      <title>Agreement of Image Quality Metrics with Radiological Evaluation in the Presence of Motion Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Reliable image quality assessment is crucial for evaluating new motion correction methods for magnetic resonance imaging. In this work, we compare the performance of commonly used reference-based and reference-free image quality metrics on a unique dataset with real motion artifacts. We further analyze the image quality metrics' robustness to typical pre-processing techniques.
  Methods: We compared five reference-based and five reference-free image quality metrics on data acquired with and without intentional motion (2D and 3D sequences). The metrics were recalculated seven times with varying pre-processing steps. The anonymized images were rated by radiologists and radiographers on a 1-5 Likert scale. Spearman correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between image quality metrics and observer scores.
  Results: All reference-based image quality metrics showed strong correlation with observer assessments, with minor performance variations across sequences. Among reference-free metrics, Average Edge Strength offers the most promising results, as it consistently displayed stronger correlations across all sequences compared to the other reference-free metrics. Overall, the strongest correlation was achieved with percentile normalization and restricting the metric values to the skull-stripped brain region. In contrast, correlations were weaker when not applying any brain mask and using min-max or no normalization.
  Conclusion: Reference-based metrics reliably correlate with radiological evaluation across different sequences and datasets. Pre-processing steps, particularly normalization and brain masking, significantly influence the correlation values. Future research should focus on refining pre-processing techniques and exploring machine learning approaches for automated image quality evaluation.</description>

      <title>TrackRAD2025 challenge dataset: Real-time tumor tracking for MRI-guided radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize anatomical motion is becoming increasingly important when treating cancer patients with radiotherapy. Hybrid MRI-linear accelerator (MRI-linac) systems allow real-time motion management during irradiation. This paper presents a multi-institutional real-time MRI time series dataset from different MRI-linac vendors. The dataset is designed to support developing and evaluating real-time tumor localization (tracking) algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy within the TrackRAD2025 challenge (https://trackrad2025.grand-challenge.org/).
  Acquisition and validation methods: The dataset consists of sagittal 2D cine MRIs in 585 patients from six centers (3 Dutch, 1 German, 1 Australian, and 1 Chinese). Tumors in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis acquired on two commercially available MRI-linacs (0.35 T and 1.5 T) were included. For 108 cases, irradiation targets or tracking surrogates were manually segmented on each temporal frame. The dataset was randomly split into a public training set of 527 cases (477 unlabeled and 50 labeled) and a private testing set of 58 cases (all labeled).
  Data Format and Usage Notes: The data is publicly available under the TrackRAD2025 collection: https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/4539. Both the images and segmentations for each patient are available in metadata format.
  Potential Applications: This novel clinical dataset will enable the development and evaluation of real-time tumor localization algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy. By enabling more accurate motion management and adaptive treatment strategies, this dataset has the potential to advance the field of radiotherapy significantly.</description>

      <title>A Reduced-Order CFD Approach for Intermediate grade Coronary Arterial Clinical Parameter Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a top reason of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a novel approach by integrating patient-specific Multi-slice CT scans into CAD models and employing a one-dimensional numerical framework to assess varying degrees of stenosis. The computational analysis encompasses the entire arterial tree, with a particular focus on stenosed coronary arteries modelled using an analytical equation. One-dimensional characteristic equations, utilizing forward and backward characteristic variables, are used to derive essential parameters such as area and velocity. A model based on resistance with reflection coefficient set to zero and realistic pressure waveform input is applied at the outflow and inflow respectively. Boundary conditions generated from the 1D model, capturing global characteristics, are subsequently used to simulate a 2D axisymmetric model, which captures local characteristics. The numerical solvers are validated against literature results, ensuring grid independence. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) are calculated using various non-Newtonian models across different severities for higher order model. Additionally, the role of lesion length in stenosed coronary arteries is investigated. Numerical simulations are performed over one cardiac cycle, covering both systole and diastole phases. The results demonstrate that FFR and iFR decrease with increasing stenosis severity. This method provides a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool for evaluating the functional severity of coronary artery stenosis in clinical settings, effectively capturing both global and local hemodynamic characteristics.</description>

      <title>ALMA: a mathematics-driven approach for determining tuning parameters in generalized LASSO problems, with applications to MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique employed for non-invasive in vivo visualization of internal structures. Sparsity is often deployed to accelerate the signal acquisition or overcome the presence of motion artifacts, improving the quality of image reconstruction. Image reconstruction algorithms use TV-regularized LASSO (Total Variation-regularized LASSO) to retrieve the missing information of undersampled signals, by cleaning the data of noise and while optimizing sparsity. A tuning parameter moderates the balance between these two aspects; its choice affecting the quality of the reconstructions. Currently, there is a lack of general deterministic techniques to choose these parameters, which are oftentimes manually selected and thus hinder the reliability of the reconstructions. Here, we present ALMA (Algorithm for Lagrange Multipliers Approximation), an iterative mathematics-inspired technique that computes tuning parameters for generalized LASSO problems during MRI reconstruction. We analyze quantitatively the performance of these parameters for imaging reconstructions via TV-LASSO in an MRI context on phantoms. Although our study concentrates on TV-LASSO, the techniques developed here hold significant promise for a wide array of applications. ALMA is not only adaptable to more generalized LASSO problems but is also robust to accommodate other forms of regularization beyond total variation. Moreover, it extends effectively to handle non-Cartesian sampling trajectories, broadening its utility in complex data reconstruction scenarios. More generally, ALMA provides a powerful tool for numerically solving constrained optimization problems across various disciplines, offering a versatile and impactful solution for advanced computational challenges.</description>

Abstract: Segmenting stroke lesions in MRI is challenging due to diverse acquisition protocols that limit model generalisability. In this work, we introduce two physics-constrained approaches to generate synthetic quantitative MRI (qMRI) images that improve segmentation robustness across heterogeneous domains. Our first method, $\texttt{qATLAS}$, trains a neural network to estimate qMRI maps from standard MPRAGE images, enabling the simulation of varied MRI sequences with realistic tissue contrasts. The second method, $\texttt{qSynth}$, synthesises qMRI maps directly from tissue labels using label-conditioned Gaussian mixture models, ensuring physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on multiple out-of-domain datasets show that both methods outperform a baseline UNet, with $\texttt{qSynth}$ notably surpassing previous synthetic data approaches. These results highlight the promise of integrating MRI physics into synthetic data generation for robust, generalisable stroke lesion segmentation.

Abstract: We study the transport and deposition of inhaled aerosols in a mid-generation, mucus-lined lung airway, with the aim of understanding if and how airborne particles can avoid the mucus and deposit on the airway wall -- an outcome that is harmful in case of allergens and pathogens but beneficial in case of aerosolized drugs. We adopt the weighted-residual integral boundary-layer model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 762, 2015, pp. 68-109) to describe the dynamics of the mucus-air interface, as well as the flow in both phases. The transport of mucus induced by wall-attached cilia is also considered, via a coarse-grained boundary condition at the base of the mucus. We show that the capillary-driven Rayleigh-Plateau instability plays an important role in particle deposition by drawing the mucus into large annular humps and leaving substantial areas of the wall exposed to particles. We find, counter-intuitively, that these mucus-depleted zones enlarge on increasing the mucus volume fraction. Particles spanning a range of sizes (0.1 to 50 microns) are modelled using the Maxey-Riley equation, augmented with Brownian forces. We find a non-monotonic dependence of deposition on size. Small particles diffuse across streamlines due to Brownian motion, while large particles are thrown off streamlines by inertial forces -- particularly when air flows past mucus humps. Intermediate-sized particles are tracer-like and deposit the least. Remarkably, increasing the mucus volume need not increase entrapment: the effect depends on particle-size, because more mucus produces not only deeper humps that intercept inertial particles, but also larger depleted-zones that enable diffusive particles to deposit on the wall.</description>
