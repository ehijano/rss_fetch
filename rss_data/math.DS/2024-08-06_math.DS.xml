      <title>Stochastic bifurcation of a three-dimensional stochastic Kolmogorov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we systematically investigate the stochastic bifurcations of both ergodic stationary measures and global dynamics for stochastic Kolmogorov differential systems, which relate closely to the change of the sign of Lyapunov exponents. It is derived that there exists a threshold $\sigma_0$ such that, if the noise intensity $\sigma \geq\sigma_0$, the noise destroys all bifurcations of the deterministic system and the corresponding stochastic Kolmogorov system is uniquely ergodic. On the other hand, when the noise intensity $\sigma&lt;\sigma_0$, the stochastic system undergoes bifurcations from the unique ergodic stationary measure to three different types of ergodic stationary measures: (I) finitely many ergodic measures supported on rays, (II) infinitely many ergodic measures supported on rays, (III) infinitely many ergodic measures supported on invariant cones. Correspondingly, the global dynamics undergo similar bifurcation phenomena, which even displays infinitely many Crauel random periodic solutions in the sense of \cite{ELR21}. Furthermore, we prove that as $\sigma$ tends to zero, the ergodic stationary measures converge to either Dirac measures supported on equilibria, or to Haar measures supported on non-trivial deterministic periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Extreme events for horocycle flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove extreme value laws for cusp excursions of the horocycle flow in the case of surfaces of constant negative curvature. The key idea of our approach is to study the hitting time distribution for shrinking Poincar\'e sections that have a particularly simple scaling property under the action of the geodesic flow. This extends the extreme value law of Kirsebom and Mallahi-Karai [arXiv:2209.07283] for cusp excursions for the modular surface. Here we show that the limit law can be expressed in terms of Hall's formula for the gap distribution of the Farey sequence.</description>

      <title>Taming Uncertainty in a Complex World: The Rise of Uncertainty Quantification -- A Tutorial for Beginners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial about uncertainty quantification (UQ) for those who have no background but are interested in learning more in this area. It exploits many very simple examples, which are understandable to undergraduates, to present the ideas of UQ. Topics include characterizing uncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and UQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each topic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both Matlab and Python codes are made available for these simple examples.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of time delay systems via pseudospectral collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pragmatic approach to the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics for systems with discrete delays. It relies on approximating the underlying delay model with a system of ordinary differential equations via pseudospectral collocation. To minimize the reconstruction error, the new strategy avoids optimizing all possible multiple unknown delays, identifying only the maximum one. The computational burden is thus greatly reduced, improving the performance of recent implementations that work directly on the delay system.</description>

      <title>Existence of generalized solitary waves for a diatomic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence of generalized solitary waves (solitary waves with small ripples at infinity) for a diatomic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice. It is proved that the FPUT lattice problem has a generalized solitary-wave solution with the amplitude of those ripples algebraically small using dynamical system approach. The problem is first formulated as a dynamical system problem and then the center manifold reduction theorem with Laurent series expansion is applied to show that this system can be reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations with dimension five. Its dominant system has a homoclinic solution. By applying a perturbation method and adjusting some appropriate constants, it is shown that this homoclinic solution persists for the original dynamical system, which connects to a periodic solution of algebraically small amplitude at infinity (called generalized homoclinic solution), which yields the existence of a generalized solitary wave for the FPUT lattice. The result presented here with the algebraic smallness of those ripples will be needed to show the existence of generalized multi-hump waves for the FPUT lattice later.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on invariant tori emerging through forced symmetry breaking in phase oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider synchrony patterns in coupled phase oscillator networks that correspond to invariant tori. For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are equilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the invariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network interaction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori that are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method; this yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as well as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled oscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting tori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a boundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony patterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as heteroclinic cycles.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of integral points, equivariant compactifications and equidistributions for homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let U be a homogeneous variety over rational numbers of some linear algebraic group. Fix an integral model and assume the existence of infinitely many integral points. Then one would like to give an asymptotic count with the help of some height function. In many cases, with the help of measure rigidity of unipotent flows, we reduce this problem to one on equivariant birational geometry. For instance, we show that if G and H are both connected, semisimple, simply connected and without compact factors, then U=G/H is strongly Hardy-Littlewood with respect to certain height function. We also show that when H is "large" in H and both G and H are connected, reductive and without non-trivial Q-characters, then for every equivariant height, the asymptotic of integral points is the same as the volume asymptotic up to a constant. Three concrete examples with explicit heights are also provided to illustrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Networks of Pendula with Diffusive Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of coupled pendula with diffusive interactions, which could depend both on positions and on momenta. The coupling structure is defined by an undirected network, while the dynamic equations are derived from a Hamiltonian; as such, the energy is conserved. We provide sufficient conditions on the energy for bounded motion, identifying the oscillatory regime. We also describe the bifurcations of synchronised states, exploiting the quantities related to the network structure. Moreover, we consider patterns of anti-synchrony arising from the specific properties of the model. Such patterns can be linked to global properties of the system by looking at motion of the centre of mass. Nonetheless, the anti-synchrony patterns play also a relevant role in the bifurcation analysis. For the case of graphs with a large number of nodes, we characterise the parameter range in which the bifurcations occur. We complement the analysis with some numerical simulations showing the interplay between bifurcations of the origin and transitions to chaos of nearby orbits. A key feature is that the observed chaotic regime emerges at low energies.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised multi-scale diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unsupervised and principled diagnosis of multi-scale data is a fundamental obstacle in modern scientific problems from, for instance, weather and climate prediction, neurology, epidemiology, and turbulence. Multi-scale data is characterized by a combination of processes acting along multiple dimensions simultaneously, spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, non-stationarity, and/or invariances such as translation and rotation. Existing methods are not well-suited to multi-scale data, usually requiring supervised strategies such as human intervention, extensive tuning, or selection of ideal time periods. We present the multi-resolution Coherent Spatio-Temporal Scale Separation (mrCOSTS), a hierarchical and automated algorithm for the diagnosis of coherent patterns or modes in multi-scale data. mrCOSTS is a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition which decomposes data into bands of spatial patterns with shared time dynamics, thereby providing a robust method for analyzing multi-scale data. It requires no training but instead takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of multi-scale systems. We demonstrate mrCOSTS using complex multi-scale data sets that are canonically difficult to analyze: 1) climate patterns of sea surface temperature, 2) electrophysiological observations of neural signals of the motor cortex, and 3) horizontal wind in the mountain boundary layer. With mrCOSTS, we trivially retrieve complex dynamics that were previously difficult to resolve while additionally extracting hitherto unknown patterns of activity embedded in the dynamics, allowing for advancing the understanding of these fields of study. This method is an important advancement for addressing the multi-scale data which characterize many of the grand challenges in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>On $r$-Neutralized Entropy: Entropy Formula and Existence of Measures Attaining the Supremum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study $r$-neutralized local entropy and derive some entropy formulas. For an ergodic hyperbolic measure of a smooth system, we show that the $r$-neutralized local entropy equals the Brin-Katok local entropy plus $r$ times the pointwise dimension of the measure. We further establish the existence of ergodic measures that maximize the $r$-neutralized entropy for certain hyperbolic systems. Moreover, we construct a uniformly hyperbolic system, for which such measures are not unique. Finally, we present some rigidity results related to these ergodic measures.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Stability for Skew Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study algebraic stability for rational skew products in two dimensions $\phi : X \dashrightarrow X$, i.e. maps of the form $\phi(x, y) = (\phi_1(x), \phi_2(x, y))$. We prove that when $X$ is a birationally ruled surface and $\phi_1$ has no superattracting cycles, then we can always find a smooth surface $\hat X$ and an algebraic stabilisation $\pi : (\hat \phi, \hat X) \to (\phi, X)$ which is a birational morphism. We provide an example of a skew product $\phi$ where $\phi_1$ has a superattracting fixed point and $\phi$ is not algebraically stable on any model.
  Our techniques involve transforming the stabilisation issue into a combinatorial dynamical problem for a 'non-Archimedean skew product' $\phi_*: \mathbb P^1_{\text{an}}(\mathbb K) \to \mathbb P^1_{\text{an}}(\mathbb K)$ on the Berkovich projective line over the Puiseux series, $\mathbb K$. The Fatou-Julia theory for $\phi_*$ is instrumental to our approach.</description>

      <title>Can multivariate Granger causality detect directed connectivity of a multistable and dynamic biological decision network model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting causal connections can advance interpretable AI and machine learning. Granger causality (GC) is a robust statistical method for estimating directed influences (DC) between signals. While GC has been widely applied to analysing neuronal signals in biological neural networks and other domains, its application to complex, nonlinear, and multistable neural networks is less explored. In this study, we applied time-domain multi-variate Granger causality (MVGC) to the time series neural activity of all nodes in a trained multistable biologically based decision neural network model with real-time decision uncertainty monitoring. Our analysis demonstrated that challenging two-choice decisions, where input signals could be closely matched, and the appropriate application of fine-grained sliding time windows, could readily reveal the original model's DC. Furthermore, the identified DC varied based on whether the network had correct or error decisions. Integrating the identified DC from different decision outcomes recovered most of the original model's architecture, despite some spurious and missing connectivity. This approach could be used as an initial exploration to enhance the interpretability and transparency of dynamic multistable and nonlinear biological or AI systems by revealing causal connections throughout different phases of neural network dynamics and outcomes.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Set-Based Confidence: Convergence Criteria and Periodic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new multidimensional extension of the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) opinion dynamics model, where opinion proximity is not determined by a norm or metric. Instead, each agent trusts opinions within the Minkowski sum $\xi+\mathcal{O}$, where $\xi$ is the agent's current opinion and $\mathcal{O}$ is the confidence set defining acceptable deviations. During each iteration, agents update their opinions by simultaneously averaging the trusted opinions. Unlike traditional HK systems, where $\mathcal{O}$ is a ball in some norm, our model allows the confidence set to be non-convex and even unbounded.
  We demonstrate that the new model, referred to as SCOD (Set-based Confidence Opinion Dynamics), can exhibit properties absent in the conventional HK model. Some solutions may converge to non-equilibrium points in the state space, while others oscillate periodically. These ``pathologies'' disappear if the set $\mathcal{O}$ is symmetric and contains zero in its interior: similar to the usual HK model, SCOD then converges in a finite number of iterations to one of the equilibrium points. The latter property is also preserved if one agent is "stubborn" and resists changing their opinion, yet still influences the others; however, two stubborn agents can lead to oscillations.</description>

      <title>Isolating Signatures of Cyberattacks under Stressed Grid Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a controlled cyber-physical network, such as a power grid, any malicious data injection in the sensor measurements can lead to widespread impact due to the actions of the closed-loop controllers. While fast identification of the attack signatures is imperative for reliable operations, it is challenging to do so in a large dynamical network with tightly coupled nodes. A particularly challenging scenario arises when the cyberattacks are strategically launched during a grid stress condition, caused by non-malicious physical disturbances. In this work, we propose an algorithmic framework -- based on Koopman mode (KM) decomposition -- for online identification and visualization of the cyberattack signatures in streaming time-series measurements from a power network. The KMs are capable of capturing the spatial embedding of both natural and anomalous modes of oscillations in the sensor measurements and thus revealing the specific influences of cyberattacks, even under existing non-malicious grid stress events. Most importantly, it enables us to quantitatively compare the outcomes of different potential cyberattacks injected by an attacker. The performance of the proposed algorithmic framework is illustrated on the IEEE 68-bus test system using synthetic attack scenarios. Such knowledge regarding the detection of various cyberattacks will enable us to devise appropriate diagnostic scheme while considering varied constraints arising from different attacks.</description>

      <title>Recovering the state and dynamics of autonomous system with partial states solution using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the performance of deep hidden physics model (M. Raissi 2018) for autonomous system, this systems do not explicitly depend on time. The dynamics of states are dependent on states itself. Such systems can be found in nature and have applications
  in modeling chemical concentrations, population dynamics, n-body problems in physics etc. In this work we are going to see how we can obtain dynamics of states based on solution of limited partial states. The proposed method can find the state and dynamics of which the data is provided in the training, although we do not claim to accurately find the solution of states whose data is not utilized while training.</description>

      <title>Optimal policy for control of epidemics with constrained time intervals and region-based interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a policy model coupled with the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model to study interactions between policy-making and the dynamics of epidemics. We consider both single-region policies, as well as game-theoretic models involving interactions among several regions, and hierarchical interactions among policy-makers modeled as multi-layer games. We assume that the policy functions are piece-wise constant with a minimum time interval for each policy stage, considering policies cannot change frequently in time or they cannot be easily followed. The optimal policy is obtained by minimizing a cost function which consists of an implementation cost, an impact cost, and, in the case of multi-layer games, a non-compliance cost. We show in a case study of COVID-19 in France that when the cost function is reduced to the impact cost and is parameterized as the final epidemic size, the solution approximates that of the optimal control in Bliman et al, J. Optim. Theory Appl., 189, 2021, for sufficiently small minimum policy time interval. For a larger time interval however the optimal policy is a step down function, quite different from the step up structure typically deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we present a counterfactual study of how the pandemic would have evolved if herd immunity was reached during the second wave in the county of Los Angeles, California. Lastly, we study a case of three interacting counties with and without a governing state.</description>

Abstract: We show exponential mixing of passive scalars advected by a solution to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with finitely many (e.g. four) forced modes satisfying a hypoellipticity condition. Our proof combines the asymptotic strong Feller framework of Hairer and Mattingly with the mixing theory of Bedrossian, Blumenthal, and Punshon-Smith.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we couple a population dynamics model with a model for optimal foraging to study the interdependence between individual-level cost-benefits and population-scale dynamics. Specifically, we study the logistic growth model, which provides insights into population dynamics under resource limitations. Unlike exponential growth, the logistic model incorporates the concept of carrying capacity, thus offering a more realistic depiction of biological populations as they near environmental limits. We aim to study the impact of individual-level incentives driving behavioral responses in a dynamic environment. Specifically, explore the coupled dynamics between population density and individuals' foraging times. Our results yield insights into the effects of population size on individuals' optimal foraging efforts, which impacts the population's size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tautological Lamination arises in holomorphic dynamics as a combinatorial model for the geometry of 1-dimensional slices of the Shift Locus. In each degree $q$ the tautological lamination defines an iterated sequence of partitions of $1$ (one for each integer $n$) into numbers of the form $2^m q^{-n}$. Denote by $N_q(n,m)$ the number of times $2^mq^{-n}$ arises in the $n$th partition. We prove a recursion formula for $N_q(n,0)$, and a gap theorem: $N_q(n,n)=1$ and $N_q(n,m)=0$ for $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor &lt; m &lt; n$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Diffusion on Networks: Perturbations and Consensus Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of equations representing nonlinear diffusion on networks. A particular instance of our model can be seen as a network equivalent of the porous-medium equation. We are interested in studying perturbations of such a system and describing the consensus dynamics. The nonlinearity of the equations gives rise to potentially intricate structures of equilibria that can intersect the consensus space, creating singularities. For the unperturbed case, we characterise the sets of equilibria by exploiting the symmetries under group transformations of the nonlinear vector field. Under small perturbations, we obtain a slow-fast system. Thus, we analyse the slow-fast dynamics near the singularities on the consensus space. The analysis at this stage is carried out for complete networks, allowing a detailed characterisation of the system. We provide a linear approximation of the intersecting branches of equilibria at the singular points; as a consequence, we show that, generically, the singularities on the consensus space turn out to be transcritical. We prove under local assumptions the existence of canard solutions. For generic graph structures, assuming more strict conditions on the perturbation, we prove the existence of a maximal canard, which coincides with the consensus subspace. In addition, we validate by numerical simulations the principal findings of our main theory, extending the study to non-complete graphs. Moreover, we show how the delayed loss of stability associated to the canards induces transient spatio-temporal patterns.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a general pressure gap criterion for closed rank 1 manifolds whose singular sets are given by codimension 1 totally geodesic flat subtori. As an application, we show that under certain curvature constraints, potentials that decay faster than geometric potentials (towards to the singular set) have pressure gaps and have no phase transitions. Along the way, we prove that geometric potentials are H\"older continuous near singular sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study billiards in domains enclosed by circular polygons. These are closed $C^1$ strictly convex curves formed by finitely many circular arcs. We prove the existence of a set in phase space, corresponding to generic sliding trajectories close enough to the boundary of the domain, in which the return billiard dynamics is semiconjugate to a transitive subshift on infinitely many symbols that contains the full $N$-shift as a topological factor for any $N \in \mathbb{N}$, so it has infinite topological entropy. We prove the existence of uncountably many asymptotic generic sliding trajectories approaching the boundary with optimal uniform linear speed, give an explicit exponentially big (in $q$) lower bound on the number of $q$-periodic trajectories as $q \to \infty$, and present an unusual property of the length spectrum. Our proofs are entirely analytical.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of ergodic averages with M\"obius weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\nu,T)$ be a measure-preserving system, and let $P_1,\ldots, P_k$ be polynomials with integer coefficients. We prove that, for any $f_1,\ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$, the M\"obius-weighted polynomial multiple ergodic averages \begin{align*}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n\leq N}\mu(n)f_1(T^{P_1(n)}x)\cdots f_k(T^{P_k(n)}x) \end{align*} converge to $0$ pointwise almost everywhere. Specialising to $P_1(y)=y, P_2(y)=2y$, this solves a problem of Frantzikinakis. We also prove pointwise convergence for a more general class of multiplicative weights for multiple ergodic averages involving distinct degree polynomials. For the proofs we establish some quantitative generalised von Neumann theorems for polynomial configurations that are of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop a theory of Patterson--Sullivan measures associated to coarse cocycles of convergence groups. This framework includes Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to the Busemann cocycle on the geodesic boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces and Patterson-Sullivan measures on flag manifolds associated to Anosov (or more general transverse) subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, as well as more examples. Under some natural geometric assumptions on the coarse cocycle, we prove existence, uniqueness, and ergodicity results.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Linearization of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its variants, such as extended DMD (EDMD), are broadly used to fit simple linear models to dynamical systems known from observable data. As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.15172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse geometry studies metric spaces on the large scale. The recently introduced notion of coarse entropy is a tool to study dynamics from the coarse point of view. We prove that all isometries of a given metric space have the same coarse entropy and that this value is a coarse invariant. We call this value the coarse entropy of the space and investigate its connections with other properties of the space. We prove that it can only be either zero or infinity, and although for many spaces this dichotomy coincides with the subexponential--exponential growth dichotomy, there is no relation between coarse entropy and volume growth more generally. We completely characterise this dichotomy for spaces with bounded geometry and for quasi-geodesic spaces. As an application, we provide an example where coarse entropy yields an obstruction for a coarse embedding, where such an embedding is not precluded by considerations of volume growth.</description>

Abstract: We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically for nonlinear functions in the number of susceptibles. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal theory of instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

Abstract: Let $s(n)$ denote the number of "$1$"s in the dyadic representation of a positive integer $n$ and sequence $S(n) = s(1)+s(2)+\dots+s(n-1)$. The Trollope-Delange formula is a classic result that represents the sequence $S$ in terms of the Takagi function. In this work, we extend this result by introducing a weighted analog of $s(n)$, deriving a variant of the Trollope-Delange formula for this generalization.</description>
