      <title>Two-Fold Anisotropic Superconductivity in Bilayer T$_d$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric 2D superconductors with large spin-orbit coupling offer an opportunity to explore superconducting behaviors far beyond the Pauli limit. One such superconductor, few-layer T$_d$-MoTe$_2$, has large upper critical fields that can exceed the Pauli limit by up to 600%. However, the mechanisms governing this enhancement are still under debate, with theory pointing towards either spin-orbit parity coupling or tilted Ising spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, ferroelectricity concomitant with superconductivity has been recently observed in the bilayer, where strong changes to superconductivity can be observed throughout the ferroelectric transition pathway. Here, we report the superconducting behavior of bilayer T$_d$-MoTe$ _2$ under an in-plane magnetic field, while systematically varying magnetic field angle and out-of-plane electric field strength. We find that superconductivity in bilayer MoTe$_2$ exhibits a two-fold symmetry with an upper critical field maxima occurring along the b-axis and minima along the a-axis. The two-fold rotational symmetry remains robust throughout the entire superconducting region and ferroelectric hysteresis loop. Our experimental observations of the spin-orbit coupling strength (up to 16.4 meV) agree with the spin texture and spin splitting from first-principles calculations, indicating that tilted Ising spin-orbit coupling is the dominant underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Possible pairing states in the superconducting bilayer nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine various possibilities for the pairing mechanisms in the recently discovered bilayer-nickelate superconductor within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework. Unlike earlier studies, where only a pure $d$-wave or sign-changing $s$-wave superconductivity instability was investigated, our study explores the possibilities of mixed-state superconducting instability such as the one involving both $d$- and sign-changing $s$-waves. While assuming that the superconductivity arises because of the magnetic correlations, we examine the nature of the superconducting gap function associated density of states with various possible magnetic correlation wavevectors arising out as a result of multiple pockets owing to the multiple orbitals and bilayer splitting. We also explore the effect of differences in the nature of Fermi surfaces suggested by various studies.</description>

      <title>Superband: an Electronic-band and Fermi surface structure database of superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In comparison to simpler data such as chemical formulas and lattice structures, electronic band structure data provide a more fundamental and intuitive insight into superconducting phenomena. In this work, we generate superconductor's lattice structure files optimized for density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Through DFT, we obtain electronic band superconductors, including band structures, density of states (DOS), and Fermi surface data. Additionally, we outline efficient methodologies for acquiring structure data, establish high-throughput DFT computational protocols, and introduce tools for extracting this data from large-scale DFT calculations. As an example, we have curated a dataset containing information on 2474 superconductors along with their experimentally determined superconducting transition temperatures, which is well-suited for machine learning applications. This work also provides guidelines for accessing and utilizing this dataset. Furthermore, we present a neural network model designed for training with this data. All the aforementioned data and code are publicly available at http://www.superband.work.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase Enforced Spinor Pairing Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

      <title>Enhancing superconducting transition temperature of lanthanum superhydride by increasing hydrogen vacancy concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various clathrate superhydride superconductors have been found to possess hydrogen deficiency in experimental samples, while their impacts on superconductivity are often neglected. In this study, we investigate the superconductivity of lanthanum superhydride with hydrogen deficiency (LaH$_{10-\delta}$) from first principles using path-integral approaches. Under the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations, hydrogen vacancies are found to diffuse within the system, leading to modifications in ion vibrations, electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling. These changes result in a non-monotonic dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) on the vacancy concentration ($\delta$). By comparing the experimental and theoretical equations of state, we suggest that $\delta$ varies across samples under different pressures. This explains the positive pressure dependence of $T_c$ in experiments below 150 GPa. Remarkably, within this pressure range, we find that $T_c$ could be further raised by increasing $\delta$.</description>

      <title>Josephson diodes induced by the loop current states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</description>

      <title>Microwave radiation at criticality in a hybrid Josephson array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous metallic behavior is ubiquitously observed near superconductor-insulator quantum critical points and, if persistent to zero temperature, poses a challenge to current theories of metals. One explanation for this behavior could be incomplete thermal equilibrium between the sample and the cryostat. However, despite decades of study, the actual temperature of an anomalous metallic sample has not been measured. We therefore introduce a new experimental probe by measuring microwave radiation emitted from the anomalous metal, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. The total emitted radiation exceeds the limits of thermodynamic equilibrium, but is well described by an elevated sample temperature. This extracted sample temperature matches the onset of anomalous metallic behavior. Additionally, we discover scaling behavior of radiative noise in the presence of an applied bias. Elements of our noise-scaling observations were predicted based on nonlinear critical field theories and gauge-gravity duality. This work shows that, in a prominent model system, anomalous metallic behavior is a non-equilibrium effect, and opens a new frontier in the study of universal, non-equilibrium phenomena near quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Bound states and scattering of magnons on a superconducting vortex in ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the magnon spectrum in a thin ferromagnetic-superconductor heterostructure in the presence of a single superconducting vortex. We employ the Bogolubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian which describes the magnons in the presence of the stray magnetic field and the non-uniform magnetic texture induced by the vortex. We find that the vortex localizes magnon states approximately in the same way as a charge center produces electron bound states due to screened Coulomb interaction in the two-dimensional electron gas. The number of these localized states is substantially determined by the material parameters of the ferromagnetic film only. We solve the scattering problem for an incident plane spin wave and compute the total and transport cross sections. We demonstrate that the vortex-induced non-uniform magnetic texture in chiral ferromagnetic film produces a skew scattering of magnons. We explore the peculiarities of the quantum scattering problem that correspond to orbiting in the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for number-conserving bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, valence-skipping and topological crystalline metal in AgSnSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent suggestion of valence-skipping phenomenon driving a two-gap superconductivity in $Ag$-doped SnSe, by Kataria, \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. B 107, 174517 (2023)], has brought to the fore a long-standing issue once again. The absence of crystallographically inequivalent Sn cites corroborated by electronic properties of AgSnSe$_2$, calculated using first-principles density functional theory, however, does not appear to provide a strong support in favor of valence-skipping in this system. Interestingly, the signature of avoided band-crossings (with the inclusion of SOC) and non-zero \textit{mirror} Chern number ($n_{\mathcal{M}}$) confirm a non-trivial topology. The presence of mirror symmetry-protected surface states along the mirror planes indicates that AgSnSe$_2$ could be a potential candidate for topological crystalline metals (TCMs). Moreover, our calculation of electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic superconducting properties of AgSnSe$_2$, using Migdal-Eliashberg theory, gives a single-gap superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c \approx 7$K, consistent with the experimental value of $5$K. The interplay of topology and superconductivity in this three-dimensional material appears quite intriguing and it may provide new insights into the exploration of superconductivity and topology.</description>

      <title>Toolbox for nonreciprocal dispersive models in circuit QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic method for constructing effective dispersive Lindblad master equations to describe weakly-anharmonic superconducting circuits coupled by a generic dissipationless nonreciprocal linear system, with effective coupling parameters and decay rates written in terms of the immittance parameters characterizing the coupler. This article extends the foundational work of Solgun et al. (2019) for linear reciprocal couplers described by an impedance response. Here, we expand the existing toolbox to incorporate nonreciprocal elements, account for direct stray coupling between immittance ports, circumvent potential singularities, and include dissipative interactions arising from interaction with a common bath. We illustrate the use of our results with a circuit of weakly-anharmonic Josephson junctions coupled to a multiport nonreciprocal environment and a dissipative port. The results obtained here can be used for the design of complex superconducting quantum processors with non-trivial routing of quantum information, as well as analog quantum simulators of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi sea in a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which determines its conductance quantization and is characterized by Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Unlike gapped band topology described by the global feature of wave function, this topology of gapless system is associated with the geometry of Fermi sea, and thus probing and identifying $\chi_F$ are inherently difficult in high-dimensional systems. Here, we propose a dimensional reduction theory for $d$-dimensional Fermi sea topology, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the feature of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. By performing the gapization for the metallic systems, we also reveal that $\chi_F$ can be reflected in the gapped band topology, which further provides an indirect way to measure $\chi_F$ through the (pseudo)spin structures of the superconducting system. Our work opens an avenue to characterize and detect the Fermi sea topology using low-dimensional momentum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superfluid dilute neutron matter and ultracold gas, close to the unitary regime, exhibit several similarities. Therefore, to a certain extent, fermionic ultracold gases may serve as emulators of dilute neutron matter, which forms the inner crust of neutron stars and is not directly accessed experimentally. Quantum vortices are one of the most significant properties of neutron superfluid, essential for comprehending neutron stars' dynamics. The structure and dynamics of quantum vortices as a function of pairing correlations' strength are being investigated experimentally and theoretically in ultracold gases. Certain aspects of these studies are relevant to neutron stars. We provide an overview of the characteristics of quantum vortices in s-wave-type fermionic and electrically neutral superfluids. The main focus is on the dynamics of fermionic vortices and their intrinsic structure.</description>

      <title>Pairing transitions in a Binary Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stable Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper (BCS) pairing state of a bosonic system has long been sought theoretically and experimentally. Here we study the BCS state of a binary Bose gas with $s$-wave intra-species repulsions and an inter-species attraction in the mean-field-stable region. We find that above the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) transtion temperature, there is a phase transtion from the normal state to the BCS state due to inter-species pairing. When the temperature decreases, another phase transtion from the BCS state to the mixture state with both atomic BEC and inter-species pairs occurs. As the temperature is further lowered, the mixuture state is taken over by the BEC state. The phase diagram of this system is presented and experimental implications are discussed.</description>
