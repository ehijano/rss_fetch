      <title>Can we trust LLMs as a tutor for our students? Evaluating the Quality of LLM-generated Feedback in Statistics Exams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central challenges for instructors is offering meaningful individual feedback, especially in large courses. Faced with limited time and resources, educators are often forced to rely on generalized feedback, even when more personalized support would be pedagogically valuable. To overcome this limitation, one potential technical solution is to utilize large language models (LLMs). For an exploratory study using a new platform connected with LLMs, we conducted a LLM-corrected mock exam during the "Introduction to Statistics" lecture at the University of Munich (Germany). The online platform allows instructors to upload exercises along with the correct solutions. Students complete these exercises and receive overall feedback on their results, as well as individualized feedback generated by GPT-4 based on the correct answers provided by the lecturers. The resulting dataset comprised task-level information for all participating students, including individual responses and the corresponding LLM-generated feedback. Our systematic analysis revealed that approximately 7 \% of the 2,389 feedback instances contained errors, ranging from minor technical inaccuracies to conceptually misleading explanations. Further, using a combined feedback framework approach, we found that the feedback predominantly focused on explaining why an answer was correct or incorrect, with fewer instances providing deeper conceptual insights, learning strategies or self-regulatory advice. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of deploying LLMs as scalable feedback tools in higher education, emphasizing the need for careful quality monitoring and prompt design to maximize their pedagogical value.</description>

      <title>Causal Regime Detection in Energy Markets With Augmented Time Series Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy markets exhibit complex causal relationships between weather patterns, generation technologies, and price formation, with regime changes occurring continuously rather than at discrete break points. Current approaches model electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</description>

      <title>Towards Causal Market Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The nature of mathematical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling has become a widespread, useful tool in mathematics applied to diverse fields, from physics to economics to biomedicine. Practitioners of modeling may use algebraic or differential equations, to the elements of which they attribute an intuitive relationship with some relevant aspect of reality they wish to represent. More sophisticated expressions may include stochasticity, either as observation error or system noise. However, a clear, unambiguous mathematical definition of what a model is and of what is the relationship between the model and the real-life phenomena it purports to represent has so far not been formulated. The present work aims to fill this gap, motivating the definition of a mathematical model as an operator on a Hilbert space of random variables, identifying the experimental realization as the map between the theoretical space of model construction and the computational space of statistical model identification, and tracing the relationship of the geometry of the model manifold in the abstract setting with the corresponding geometry of the prediction surfaces in statistical estimation.</description>
