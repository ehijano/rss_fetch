      <title>On the Propagation and Damping of Alfvenic Fluctuations in the Outer Solar Corona and Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze \textit{Parker Solar Probe} and \textit{Solar Orbiter} observations to investigate the propagation and dissipation of Alfv\'enic fluctuations from the outer corona to 1~AU. Conservation of wave-action flux provides the theoretical baseline for how fluctuation amplitudes scale with the Alfv\'en Mach number $M_a$, once solar-wind acceleration is accounted for. Departures from this scaling quantify the net balance between energy injection and dissipation. Fluctuation amplitudes follow wave-action conservation for $M_a &lt; M_a^{b}$ but steepen beyond this break point, which typically lies near the Alfv\'en surface ($M_a \approx 1$) yet varies systematically with normalized cross helicity $\sigma_c$ and fluctuation scale. In slow, quasi-balanced streams, the transition occurs at $M_a \lesssim 1$; in fast, imbalanced wind, WKB-like scaling persists to $M_a \gtrsim 1$. Outer-scale fluctuations maintain wave-action conservation to larger $M_a$ than inertial-range modes. The turbulent heating rate $Q$ is largest below $M_a^{b}$, indicating a preferential heating zone shaped by the degree of imbalance. Despite this, the Alfv\'enic energy flux $F_a$ remains elevated, and the corresponding damping length $\Lambda_d = F_a/Q$ remains sufficiently large to permit long-range propagation before appreciable damping occurs. Normalized damping lengths $\Lambda_d/H_A$, where $H_A$ is the inverse Alfv\'en-speed scale height, are near unity for $M_a \lesssim M_a^{b}$ but decline with increasing $M_a$ and decreasing $U$, implying that incompressible reflection-driven turbulence alone cannot account for the observed dissipation. Additional damping mechanisms -- such as compressible effects -- are likely required to account for the observed heating rates across much of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Observational study of chromospheric jets in and around a sunspot observed by NVST and SDO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To better understand the characteristics, driving mechanisms, and potential heating contributions of chromospheric jets, we analyze two contrasting types: one originating from within the sunspot penumbra (inside jets), and the other originating from outside the penumbra (outside jets). Statistical analysis of 100 jets (50 inside jets and 50 outside jets) reveals that inside jets have a projected velocity range of 4--14~km\,s$^{-1}$, a length range of 1--4~Mm, a width range of 0.2--0.6~Mm, and a lifetime range of 135--450~s, with mean values of 7.90~km\,s$^{-1}$, 2.61~Mm, 0.41~Mm, and 260~s, respectively. About 52\% of inside jets are associated with brightenings in H$\alpha$ blue wing images, and some show high-temperature signatures, suggesting a connection with localized energy release. In contrast, outside jets have higher velocities (8--50~km\,s$^{-1}$, average 19.04~km\,s$^{-1}$), greater lengths (average 6.26~Mm, up to 27.27~Mm), slightly larger widths (average 0.46~Mm), and longer lifetimes (135--630~s, average 327~s). They typically originate from regions of opposite magnetic polarities and are associated with magnetic flux emergence and EUV brightenings. Some outside jets correspond to coronal jets with inverted Y-shaped structures and temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin. Our results suggest that both jet types are driven by magnetic reconnection occurring in distinct magnetic field configurations and contribute to chromospheric and coronal heating.</description>
