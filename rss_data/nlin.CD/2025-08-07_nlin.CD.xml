      <title>Unstable periodic orbits galore and quantum hyperscarring in highly frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly frustrated magnets, with their macroscopically-degenerate classical ground states and massively-entangled quantum spin liquid phases, have been pivotal to the development of modern condensed matter concepts such as emergent symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. The effects of frustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body dynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we identify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the form of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing'' configurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general neither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of dynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while allowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of unstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'', that is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On the product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum thermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the expected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product states. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body quantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and establishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space for the non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Covariance spectrum in nonlinear recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in simultaneous recordings of large numbers of neurons have driven significant interest in the structure of neural population activity such as dimension. A key question is how these dynamic features arise mechanistically and their relationship to circuit connectivity. It was previously proposed to use the covariance eigenvalue distribution, or spectrum, which can be analytically derived in random recurrent networks, as a robust measure to describe the shape of neural population activity beyond the dimension (Hu and Sompolinsky 2022). Applications of the theoretical spectrum have broadly found accurate matches to experimental data across brain areas providing mechanistic insights into the observed low dimensional population dynamics (Morales et al. 2023). However, the empirical success highlights a gap in theory, as the neural network model used to derive the spectrum was minimal with linear neurons. In this work, we aim to close this gap by studying the covariance spectrum in networks with nonlinear neurons and under broader dynamical regimes including chaos. Surprisingly, we found that the spectrum can be precisely understood by equations analogous to the linear theory substituted with an effective recurrent connection strength parameter, that reflects both the connection weights and the nonlinearity of neurons. Across dynamical regimes, this effective connection strength provides a unified interpretation for the spectrum and dimension changes, and stays near the critical value in the chaotic regime without fine-tuning. These results further our understanding of nonlinear neural population dynamics and provide additional theoretical support for applying the covariance spectrum analysis in biological circuits.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum encoding of a turbulent field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chaotic structure of multiscale systems presents a formidable challenge to their quantum encoding. We propose a three-stage hyperspherical encoding method for turbulent fields. This method comprises a symmetry-preserving perturbation of the ground state, a measurement-specific convolution, and a final deconvolution of observables. The latter two stages employ the Hopf fibration to map quantum observables onto vortex tubes, the building blocks of fluid turbulence. Using 27 qubits, we generate an instantaneous turbulent field at a Reynolds number of $\mathit{Re} = 13900$ that reproduces the energy spectrum with Kolmogorov's five-thirds scaling, tangled vortex structures, and strong intermittency. The method only requires $\mathcal{O}(\log_2\mathit{Re})$ qubits, which is asymptotically optimal for turbulent-field encoding. This yields an exponential memory reduction over classical methods, and enables state preparation for large-scale quantum simulation of multiscale systems.</description>

      <title>Topological modes of variability of the wind-driven ocean circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Templexes are topological objects that encode the branching organization of a flow in phase space. We build on these objects to introduce the concept of topological modes of variability (TMVs). TMVs are defined as dynamical manifestations of algebraically defined cycles, called generatexes, in the templex; they provide a concrete link between abstract topological invariants and time-dependent behavior in a model or in observations. We apply this approach to a low-order model of the wind-driven ocean circulation, subject to both periodic and aperiodic forcing, and show how TMVs emerge or vanish over time in nonautonomous settings. The analysis reveals that TMVs allow for a qualitatively new understanding of variability in complex systems where linear modes fail to describe the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient-Descent Calibration of Pyragas Delayed-Feedback Control for Chaos Suppression in the Sprott Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores chaos control in the Sprott circuit by leveraging Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to calibrate Pyragas delayed feedback control. Using a third-order nonlinear differential equation, we model the circuit and aim to suppress chaos by optimizing control parameters (gain $K$, delay $T_{\text{con}}$) and the variable resistor $R_v$. Experimental voltage data, extracted from published figures via WebPlotDigitizer, serve as the calibration target. We compare two calibration techniques: sum of squared errors (SSE) minimization via grid search and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with finite differences. Joint optimization of $K$, $T_{\text{con}}$, and $R_v$ using SGD achieves superior alignment with experimental data, capturing both phase and amplitude with high fidelity. Compared to grid search, SGD excels in phase synchronization, though minor amplitude discrepancies persist due to model simplifications. Phase space analysis confirms the model ability to replicate the chaotic attractor geometry, despite slight deviations. We analyze the trade-off between calibration accuracy and computational cost, highlighting scalability challenges. Overall, SGD-based calibration demonstrates significant potential for precise control of chaotic systems, advancing mathematical modeling and applications in electrical engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement of Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium properties of many-body systems with a large number of degrees of freedom are generally expected to be described by statistical mechanics. Such expectations are closely tied to the observation of thermalization, as manifested through equipartition in time-dependent observables, which takes place both in quantum and classical systems but may look very different in comparison. By studying the dynamics of individual lattice site populations in ultracold bosonic gases, we show that the process of relaxation toward equilibrium in a quantum system can be orders of magnitude faster than in its classical counterpart. Classical chaos quantifiers reveal that this is due to a wave packet in a quantum system being able to escape regions of inefficient classical transport by a mechanism akin to tunneling. Since the presented phenomenon takes place in a broad parameter range and persists in weakly disordered systems, we expect that it occurs in a variety of many-body systems and is amenable to direct experimental verification in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms.</description>
