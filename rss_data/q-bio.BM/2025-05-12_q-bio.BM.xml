      <title>Oncolytic mechanisms and immunotherapeutic potential of Newcastle disease virus in cancer therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), classified as Avian orthoavulavirus 1 (avian paramyxovirus type 1), is a promising oncolytic agent that selectively targets and destroys cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Its oncoselectivity exploits cancer-specific defects in antiviral defenses, particularly impaired Type I interferon signaling, and dysregulated apoptotic pathways, enabling robust viral replication and cytotoxicity in malignancies such as breast, colorectal, and melanoma. NDV induces intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis through caspase activation and triggers immunogenic cell death via damage-associated molecular patterns, stimulating potent antitumours immune responses. Additionally, NDVs potential as a vaccine vector, expressing tumours-associated antigens, offers prospects for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of NDVs morphology, classification, and molecular biology, focusing on its viral entry and replication mechanisms in host cells. It explores NDVs interactions with cancer cells, emphasizing its ability to induce cytotoxicity and immune activation. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for optimizing NDVs oncolytic potential and advancing its clinical translation. Future directions include enhancing NDV through genetic engineering, combining it with therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors, and developing personalized medicine approaches tailored to tumours genomic profiles. These advancements position NDV as a versatile therapeutic agent in oncolytic virotherapy.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for enzymatic reaction prediction and characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting enzymatic reactions is crucial for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and drug discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in various scientific domains, e.g., through their ability to generalize knowledge, reason over complex structures, and leverage in-context learning strategies. In this study, we systematically evaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and 70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction, forward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask learning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA adapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to explore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning enhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared enzymatic information. We also identify key limitations, for example challenges in hierarchical EC classification schemes, highlighting areas for further improvement in LLM-driven biochemical modeling.</description>

      <title>A 3D pocket-aware and evolutionary conserved interaction guided diffusion model for molecular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion models has shown good promise for structure-based drug design and molecule optimization. Especially, the diffusion models with binding interaction guidance enables molecule generation with high affinity through forming favorable interaction within protein pocket. However, the generated molecules may not form interactions with the highly conserved residues, which are important for protein functions and bioactivities of the ligands. Herein, we developed a new 3D target-aware diffusion model DiffDecip, which explicitly incorporates the protein-ligand binding interactions and evolutionary conservation information of protein residues into both diffusion and sampling process, for molecule optimization through scaffold decoration. The model performance revealed that DiffDecip outperforms baseline model DiffDec on molecule optimization towards higher affinity through forming more non-covalent interactions with highly conserved residues in the protein pocket.</description>
