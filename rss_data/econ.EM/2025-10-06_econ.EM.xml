      <title>"Post" Pre-Analysis Plans: Valid Inference for Non-Preregistered Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) have become standard in experimental economics research, but it is nevertheless common to see researchers deviating from their PAPs to supplement preregistered estimates with non-prespecified findings. While such ex-post analysis can yield valuable insights, there is broad uncertainty over how to interpret -- or whether to even acknowledge -- non-preregistered results. In this paper, we consider the case of a truth-seeking researcher who, after seeing the data, earnestly wishes to report additional estimates alongside those preregistered in their PAP. We show that, even absent "nefarious" behavior, conventional confidence intervals and point estimators are invalid due to the fact that non-preregistered estimates are only reported in a subset of potential data realizations. We propose inference procedures that account for this conditional reporting. We apply these procedures to Bessone et al. (2021), which studies the economic effects of increased sleep among the urban poor. We demonstrate that, depending on the reason for deviating, the adjustments from our procedures can range from having no difference to an economically significant difference relative to conventional practice. Finally, we consider the robustness of our procedure to certain forms of misspecification, motivating possible heuristic checks and norms for journals to adopt.</description>

      <title>Repeated Matching Games: An Empirical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility, extending the static model of Shapley and Shubik (1971). Forward-looking agents have individual states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching market with market-clearing prices takes place. We prove the existence of an equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and show it is the solution to a social planner's problem. We also prove that a stationary equilibrium exists. We introduce econometric shocks to account for unobserved heterogeneity in match formation. We propose two algorithms to compute a stationary equilibrium. We adapt both algorithms for estimation. We estimate a model of accumulation of job-specific human capital using data on Swedish engineers.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Inflation Based on Hybrid Integration of the Riemann Zeta Function and the FPAS Model (FPAS + $\zeta$): Cyclical Flexibility, Socio-Economic Challenges and Shocks, and Comparative Analysis of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation forecasting is a core socio-economic challenge in modern macroeconomic modeling, especially when cyclical, structural, and shock factors act simultaneously. Traditional systems such as FPAS and ARIMA often struggle with cyclical asymmetry and unexpected fluctuations. This study proposes a hybrid framework (FPAS + $\zeta$) that integrates a structural macro model (FPAS) with cyclical components derived from the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(1/2 + i t)$. Using Georgia's macro data (2005-2024), a nonlinear argument $t$ is constructed from core variables (e.g., GDP, M3, policy rate), and the hybrid forecast is calibrated by minimizing RMSE via a modulation coefficient $\alpha$. Fourier-based spectral analysis and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are employed for cycle/phase identification, and a multi-criteria AHP-TOPSIS scheme compares FPAS, FPAS + $\zeta$, and ARIMA. Results show lower RMSE and superior cyclical responsiveness for FPAS + $\zeta$, along with early-warning capability for shocks and regime shifts, indicating practical value for policy institutions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of VaR Models: Historical Simulation, GARCH-Based Monte Carlo, and Filtered Historical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of three Value-at-Risk (VaR) modeling approaches: Historical Simulation (HS), GARCH with Normal approximation (GARCH-N), and GARCH with Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS), using both in-sample and multi-day forecasting frameworks. We compute daily 5 percent VaR estimates using each method and assess their accuracy via empirical breach frequencies and visual breach indicators. Our findings reveal severe miscalibration in the HS and GARCH-N models, with empirical breach rates far exceeding theoretical levels. In contrast, the FHS method consistently aligns with theoretical expectations and exhibits desirable statistical and visual behavior. We further simulate 5-day cumulative returns under both GARCH-N and GARCH-FHS frameworks to compute multi-period VaR and Expected Shortfall. Results show that GARCH-N underestimates tail risk due to its reliance on the Gaussian assumption, whereas GARCH-FHS provides more robust and conservative tail estimates. Overall, the study demonstrates that the GARCH-FHS model offers superior performance in capturing fat-tailed risks and provides more reliable short-term risk forecasts.</description>

      <title>Counting Defiers: A Design-Based Model of an Experiment Can Reveal Evidence Beyond the Average Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging structure from the randomization process, a design-based model of an experiment with a binary intervention and outcome can reveal evidence beyond the average effect without additional data. Our proposed statistical decision rule yields a design-based maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the joint distribution of potential outcomes in intervention and control, specified by the numbers of always takers, compliers, defiers, and never takers in the sample. With a visualization, we explain why the likelihood varies with the number of defiers within the Frechet bounds determined by the estimated marginal distributions. We illustrate how the MLE varies with all possible data in samples of 50 and 200: when the estimated average effect is positive, the MLE includes defiers if takeup is below half in control and above half in intervention, unless takeup is zero in control or full in intervention. Under optimality conditions, for increasing sample sizes in which exhaustive grid search is possible, our rule's performance increases relative to a rule that places equal probability on all numbers of defiers within the estimated Frechet bounds. We offer insights into effect heterogeneity in two published experiments with positive, statistically significant average effects on takeup of desired health behaviors and plausible defiers. Our 95% smallest credible sets for defiers include zero and the estimated upper Frechet bound, demonstrating that evidence is weak. Yet, our rule yields no defiers in one experiment. In the other, our rule yields the estimated upper Frechet bound on defiers -- a count representing over 18% of the sample.</description>

      <title>Post Reinforcement Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08854v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study estimation and inference using data collected by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. These algorithms adaptively experiment by interacting with individual units over multiple stages, updating their strategies based on past outcomes. Our goal is to evaluate a counterfactual policy after data collection and estimate structural parameters, such as dynamic treatment effects, that support credit assignment and quantify the impact of early actions on final outcomes. These parameters can often be defined as solutions to moment equations, motivating moment-based estimation methods developed for static data. In RL settings, however, data are often collected adaptively under nonstationary behavior policies. As a result, standard estimators fail to achieve asymptotic normality due to time-varying variance. We propose a weighted generalized method of moments (GMM) approach that uses adaptive weights to stabilize this variance. We characterize weighting schemes that ensure consistency and asymptotic normality of the weighted GMM estimators, enabling valid hypothesis testing and uniform confidence region construction. Key applications include dynamic treatment effect estimation and dynamic off-policy evaluation.</description>
