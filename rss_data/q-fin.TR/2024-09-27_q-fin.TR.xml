      <title>Transfer learning for financial data predictions: a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Literature highlighted that financial time series data pose significant challenges for accurate stock price prediction, because these data are characterized by noise and susceptibility to news; traditional statistical methodologies made assumptions, such as linearity and normality, which are not suitable for the non-linear nature of financial time series; on the other hand, machine learning methodologies are able to capture non linear relationship in the data. To date, neural network is considered the main machine learning tool for the financial prices prediction. Transfer Learning, as a method aimed at transferring knowledge from source tasks to target tasks, can represent a very useful methodological tool for getting better financial prediction capability. Current reviews on the above body of knowledge are mainly focused on neural network architectures, for financial prediction, with very little emphasis on the transfer learning methodology; thus, this paper is aimed at going deeper on this topic by developing a systematic review with respect to application of Transfer Learning for financial market predictions and to challenges/potential future directions of the transfer learning methodologies for stock market predictions.</description>

      <title>Trading through Earnings Seasons using Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earnings release is a key economic event in the financial markets and crucial for predicting stock movements. Earnings data gives a glimpse into how a company is doing financially and can hint at where its stock might go next. However, the irregularity of its release cycle makes it a challenge to incorporate this data in a medium-frequency algorithmic trading model and the usefulness of this data fades fast after it is released, making it tough for models to stay accurate over time. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Contrastive Earnings Transformer (CET) model, a self-supervised learning approach rooted in Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), aiming to optimise the utilisation of earnings data. To ascertain its effectiveness, we conduct a comparative study of CET against benchmark models across diverse sectors. Our research delves deep into the intricacies of stock data, evaluating how various models, and notably CET, handle the rapidly changing relevance of earnings data over time and over different sectors. The research outcomes shed light on CET's distinct advantage in extrapolating the inherent value of earnings data over time. Its foundation on CPC allows for a nuanced understanding, facilitating consistent stock predictions even as the earnings data ages. This finding about CET presents a fresh approach to better use earnings data in algorithmic trading for predicting stock price trends.</description>
