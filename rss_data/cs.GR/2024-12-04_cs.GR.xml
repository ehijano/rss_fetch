      <title>It Takes Two: Real-time Co-Speech Two-person's Interaction Generation via Reactive Auto-regressive Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational scenarios are very common in real-world settings, yet existing co-speech motion synthesis approaches often fall short in these contexts, where one person's audio and gestures will influence the other's responses. Additionally, most existing methods rely on offline sequence-to-sequence frameworks, which are unsuitable for online applications. In this work, we introduce an audio-driven, auto-regressive system designed to synthesize dynamic movements for two characters during a conversation. At the core of our approach is a diffusion-based full-body motion synthesis model, which is conditioned on the past states of both characters, speech audio, and a task-oriented motion trajectory input, allowing for flexible spatial control. To enhance the model's ability to learn diverse interactions, we have enriched existing two-person conversational motion datasets with more dynamic and interactive motions. We evaluate our system through multiple experiments to show it outperforms across a variety of tasks, including single and two-person co-speech motion generation, as well as interactive motion generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system capable of generating interactive full-body motions for two characters from speech in an online manner.</description>

      <title>A Physics-embedded Deep Learning Framework for Cloth Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delicate cloth simulations have long been desired in computer graphics. Various methods were proposed to improve engaged force interactions, collision handling, and numerical integrations. Deep learning has the potential to achieve fast and real-time simulation, but common neural network structures often demand many parameters to capture cloth dynamics. This paper proposes a physics-embedded learning framework that directly encodes physical features of cloth simulation. The convolutional neural network is used to represent spatial correlations of the mass-spring system, after which three branches are designed to learn linear, nonlinear, and time derivate features of cloth physics. The framework can also integrate with other external forces and collision handling through either traditional simulators or sub neural networks. The model is tested across different cloth animation cases, without training with new data. Agreement with baselines and predictive realism successfully validate its generalization ability. Inference efficiency of the proposed model also defeats traditional physics simulation. This framework is also designed to easily integrate with other visual refinement techniques like wrinkle carving, which leaves significant chances to incorporate prevailing macing learning techniques in 3D cloth amination.</description>

      <title>LumiNet: Latent Intrinsics Meets Diffusion Models for Indoor Scene Relighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LumiNet, a novel architecture that leverages generative models and latent intrinsic representations for effective lighting transfer. Given a source image and a target lighting image, LumiNet synthesizes a relit version of the source scene that captures the target's lighting. Our approach makes two key contributions: a data curation strategy from the StyleGAN-based relighting model for our training, and a modified diffusion-based ControlNet that processes both latent intrinsic properties from the source image and latent extrinsic properties from the target image. We further improve lighting transfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent extrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning.
  Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps from a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two different images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while transferring lighting characteristics from the target. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully transfers complex lighting phenomena including specular highlights and indirect illumination across scenes with varying spatial layouts and materials, outperforming existing approaches on challenging indoor scenes using only images as input.</description>
