      <title>Optimal factor matchings for point processes on non-amenable unimodular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a unit-intensity point process $\Pi$ on the vertex set $V$ of a transitive non-amenable unimodular graph. We study invariant matchings between $\Pi$ and $V$ having small typical matching distances. When $\Pi$ is either a Poisson process or i.i.d. perturbations of the vertex set, we determine the optimal matching distance and show that it can be attained by a factor matching scheme (that is, a deterministic and equivariant function of $\Pi$).</description>

      <title>On strong law of large numbers for weakly stationary $\varphi$-mixing set-valued random variable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the notion of $\varphi$-mixing to set-valued random sequences that take values in the family of closed subsets of a Banach space. Several strong laws of large numbers for such $\varphi$-mixing sequences are stated and proved. Illustrative examples show that the hypotheses of the theorems are both natural and sharp.</description>

      <title>Deviation probabilities and Sharp Berry-Esseen bound for rightmost eigenvalue of large non-Hermitian chiral random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the rightmost eigenvalue for a chiral non-Hermitian random Dirac matrix in the maximally non-Hermitian regime ($\tau=0$). Let $(\sigma_i)_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues with positive real part. We define the normalization constants \[ s_n = \frac{4n(n+v)}{2n+v}, \qquad \gamma_n = \frac{1}{2}\log s_n - \frac{5}{4}\log(\log s_n) - \log\bigl(2^{1/4}\pi\bigr), \] and the centered and scaled variable \[ X_n = \sqrt{2s_n\log s_n}\,\bigl(\bigl(\tfrac{n}{n+v}\bigr)^{1/4}\,\max_{1\le i\le n}\Re\sigma_i \;-\; 1 \;-\; \frac{\gamma_n}{\sqrt{2s_n\log s_n}}\bigr). \] Our main result is the following sharp Berry--Esseen bound for the convergence of $X_n$ to the Gumbel distribution: \[ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \bigl|\mathbb{P}(X_n \le x) - e^{-e^{-x}}\bigr| = \frac{25 (\log\log s_n)^2}{16 e \,\log s_n}\,\bigl(1 + o(1)\bigr), \] which holds as $n \to \infty$ for an arbitrary parameter $v \ge 0$ (which may depend on $n$). As a byproduct of our analysis, we also obtain precise large- and moderate-deviation principles for the scaled rightmost eigenvalue $\bigl(\frac{n}{n+v}\bigr)^{1/4} \max_{1\le i\le n}\Re\sigma_i$, characterizing its rate of convergence to the value $1$.</description>

      <title>Tightness of the maximum of branching random walk in random environment and zero-crossings of solutions to discrete parabolic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study branching random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ in a bounded i.i.d. random environment. For this process, we prove that, for almost every realization of the environment, the distributions of the maximally displaced particle (re-centered around their medians) are tight. This extends the result of arXiv:2408.01555 , where tightness was established in the annealed sense, and of arXiv:2212.12390 , where a similar quenched result was proved for branching Brownian motion in random environment. Our proof relies on studying certain discrete-space linear PDEs and establishing that the number of zero-crossings of their solutions is non-increasing in time. We observe that our technique requires no additional assumptions on the environment, in contrast to arXiv:2408.01555 , arXiv:2212.12390 .</description>

      <title>Tail behavior of Markov-modulated generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tail behavior of Markov-modulated generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes -- that is, solutions to Langevin-type stochastic differential equations driven by a background continuous-time Markov chain. To this end, we consider a sequence of Markov modulated random affine functions $ \Psi_{n} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $, $ n \in \mathbb{N} $, and the associated iterated function system defined recursively by $ X_0^x := x $ and $ X_{n}^x := \Psi_{n-1}(X_{n-1}^x) $ for $ x \in \mathbb{R} $, $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We analyze the tail behavior of the stationary distribution of such a Markov chain using tools from Markov renewal theory. Our approach extends Goldie's implicit renewal theory~\cite{Goldie:91} and can be seen as an adaptation of Kesten's work on products of random matrices~\cite{Kesten:73} to the one-dimensional setting of random affine function systems. These results have applications in diverse areas of applied probability, including queueing theory, econometrics, mathematical finance, and population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Martingale expansion for stochastic volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The martingale expansion provides a refined approximation to the marginal distributions of martingales beyond the normal approximation implied by the martingale central limit theorem. We develop a martingale expansion framework specifically suited to continuous stochastic volatility models. Our approach accommodates both small volatility-of-volatility and fast mean-reversion models, yielding first-order perturbation expansions under essentially minimal conditions.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of the Marchenko-Pastur law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a $q$-deformed random unitary ensemble associated with the little-$q$ Laguerre weight, which provides a discrete analogue of the classical Laguerre unitary ensemble. In the double scaling regime $q=e^{-\lambda/N}$, where $N$ is the system size and $\lambda \ge 0$, we derive the limiting spectral distribution as $N\to \infty$, which yields a $q$-deformation of the Marchenko-Pastur law. The limiting density undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly determined critical value $\lambda_c$: for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$, the support consists of a single band region, whereas for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ an additional saturated region emerges adjacent to the band region. Our derivation of the limiting distribution is based on three complementary approaches: the method of moments, the analysis of a constrained equilibrium problem, and the asymptotic zero distribution of orthogonal polynomials. As a consequence, we establish the convergence of the empirical measure as well as a large deviation principle. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for the spectral moments using the combinatorial structure of orthogonal polynomials, and obtain large-$N$ expansions for these moments.</description>

      <title>On lower bounds for hypergeometric tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n,k$ be positive integers such that $n\geq k$, and let $H$ be a hypergeometric random variable counting the number of black marbles in a sample without replacement of size $k$ from an urn that contains $i\in \{1,\ldots, n\}$ black and $n - i$ white marbles. It is shown that \[ \mathbb{P}(H \ge \mathbb{E}(H)) \ge k/n\, , \, \text{when} \,\, n\ge 8k \, . \] Furthermore, provided that $1\le \mathbb{E}(H)\le \min\{i,k\}-2$ as well as that $\frac{(n-i)(n-k)}{n}&gt;1$, it is shown that \[ \mathbb{P}(H\ge \mathbb{E}(H)) \,\ge\, \frac{e^{-1/8}}{4\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{n-1}{n}} \cdot\frac{ \sqrt{\text{Var}(H)} }{1 + \sqrt{1+ \frac{n-1}{n-k}\cdot\text{Var}(H)}}\, . \] Auxiliary results which may be of independent interest include an upper bound on the tail conditional expectation and a lower bound on the mean absolute deviation of the hypergeometric distribution.</description>

      <title>Gene genealogies in haploid populations evolving according to sweepstakes reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sweepstakes reproduction may be generated by chance matching of reproduction with favorable environmental conditions. Gene genealogies generated by sweepstakes reproduction are in the domain of attraction of multiple-merger coalescents where a random number of lineages merges at such times. We consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction for haploid panmictic populations of both constant ($N$), and varying population size, and evolving in a random environment. We construct our models so that we can recover the observed number of new mutations in a given sample without requiring strong assumptions regarding the population size or the mutation rate. Our main results are {\it (i)} continuous-time coalescents that are either the Kingman coalescent or specific families of Beta- or Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents; when combining the results the parameter $\alpha$ of the Beta-coalescent ranges from 0 to 2, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring an arbitrary individual may produce; {\it (ii)} in large populations we measure time in units proportional to either $ N/\log N$ or $N$ generations; {\it (iii)} incorporating fluctuations in population size leads to time-changed multiple-merger coalescents where the time-change does not depend on $\alpha$; {\it (iv)} using simulations we show that in some cases approximations of functionals of a given coalescent do not match the ones of the ancestral process in the domain of attraction of the given coalescent; {\it (v)} approximations of functionals obtained by conditioning on the population ancestry (the ancestral relations of all gene copies at all times) are broadly similar (for the models considered here) to the approximations obtained without conditioning on the population ancestry.</description>

      <title>Quantative universality for cokernels of matrices with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove universality for cokernels of random integral matrices with symmetries via an approach different from the classical surjection moment method introduced by Wood (arXiv:1402.5149). In the symmetric case, we reprove Hodges' universality theorem (arXiv:2311.07078), i.e. the version incorporating the canonical pairing from Wood's setting, and in the alternating case we reprove the local universality theorem of Nguyen-Wood (arXiv:2210.08526). A key advantage of our method is that it is quantitative: we obtain explicit error bounds, which are exponentially small in most regimes, thereby addressing Wood's question on effective convergence rates. Our argument is inspired by Maples' exposure-process and coupling viewpoint (arXiv:1301.1239) and uses a generalized form of Fourier-analytic estimates in the exponentially sharp style of Ferber-Jain-Sah-Sawhney (arXiv:2106.04049).</description>

      <title>On multidimensional infinite dihedral group extensions of Gibbs Markov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a local central limit theorem for cocycles associated with a class of non abelian and non compact group extensions of Gibbs Markov maps. This class consists of multidimensional infinite dihedral groups. Unlike in the set up of the random walks on groups, we cannot use the convolution of measures on the group and instead we resort to an approach based on irreducible representations. Depending on the dimension of the group, we obtain either mixing, and thus ergodicity, or dissipativity. Also, we obtain the asymptotics of the first return time of the group extension to the origin.</description>

      <title>Stochastic representation of Sarmanov copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sarmanov copulas offer a simple and tractable way to build multivariate distributions by perturbing the independence copula. They admit closed-form expressions for densities and many functionals of interest, making them attractive for practical applications. However, the complex conditions on the dependence parameters to ensure that Sarmanov copulas are valid limit their application in high dimensions. Verifying the $d$-increasing property typically requires satisfying a combinatorial set of inequalities that makes direct construction difficult. To circumvent this issue, we develop a stochastic representation for bivariate Sarmanov copulas. We prove that every admissible Sarmanov can be realized as a mixture of independent univariate distributions indexed by a latent Bernoulli pair. The stochastic representation replaces the problem of verifying copula validity with the problem of ensuring nonnegativity of a Bernoulli probability mass function. The representation also recovers classical copula families, including Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern, Huang--Kotz, and Bairamov--Kotz--Bek\c{c}i as special cases. We further derive sharp global bounds for Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. We then introduce a Bernoulli-mixing construction in higher dimensions, leading to a new class of multivariate Sarmanov copulas with easily verifiable parameter constraints and scalable simulation algorithms. Finally, we show that powered versions of bivariate Sarmanov copulas admit a similar stochastic representation through block-maximal order statistics.</description>

      <title>Tail-Sensitive KL and R\'enyi Convergence of Unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via One-Shot Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms are among the most widely used sampling methods in high dimensional settings, yet their convergence properties are poorly understood in divergences that quantify relative density mismatch, such as Kullback-Leibler (KL) and R\'enyi divergences. These divergences naturally govern acceptance probabilities and warm-start requirements for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains. In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and R\'enyi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to R\'enyi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing. As a consequence, our results provide quantitative control of relative density mismatch, clarify the role of discretization bias in strong divergences, and yield principled guarantees relevant both for unadjusted sampling and for generating warm starts for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains.</description>

      <title>SCaLE: Switching Cost aware Learning and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental problem of unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, by considering high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and $\ell_2$-norm switching costs in a noisy bandit feedback model. For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Fourier estimator of spot volatility: Unbounded coefficients and jumps in the price process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Fourier estimator of Malliavin and Mancino for the spot volatility. We establish the convergence of the trigonometric polynomial to the volatility's path in a setting that includes the following aspects. First, the volatility is required to satisfy a mild integrability condition, but otherwise allowed to be unbounded. Second, the price process is assumed to have cadlag paths, not necessarily continuous. We obtain convergence rates for the probability of a bad approximation in estimated coefficients, with a speed that allow to obtain an almost sure convergence and not just in probability in the estimated reconstruction of the volatility's path. This is a new result even in the setting of continuous paths. We prove that a rescaled trigonometric polynomial approximate the quadratic jump process.</description>

      <title>A first passage problem for a Poisson counting process with a linear moving boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time to first crossing for the Poisson counting process with respect to a linear moving barrier with offset is a classic problem, although key results remain scattered across the literature and their equivalence is often unclear. Here we present a unified and pedagogical treatment of two approaches: the direct time-domain approach based on path-decomposition techniques and the Laplace-domain approach based on the Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. Beyond streamlining existing derivations and establishing their consistency, we leverage the complementary nature of the two methods to obtain new exact analytical results. Specifically, we derive an explicit large deviation function for the first-passage time distribution in the subcritical regime and closed-form expressions for the conditional mean first-passage time for arbitrary offset. Despite its simplicity, this first crossing process exhibits non-trivial critical behavior and provides a rare example where all the main results of interest can be derived exactly.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Proof of the Radon-Nikodym Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Radon-Nikodym theorem plays a significant role in the definition of Shannon entropy, f-divergences, and other basic quantities in information theory. The existence of Radon Nikodym derivates appear in many text books in measure theory but in text books on probability or information theory it is often omitted because the proof is often considered to be too difficult.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of McKean-Vlasov systems under partial observation and hidden Markov switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of mean-field control problems under partial observation. The controlled dynamics are of McKean-Vlasov type and are subject to regime switching driven by a hidden Markov chain. The observation process depends on the control and on the joint distribution of the state and control, which prevents the direct application of standard filtering techniques. The main contribution of this paper is to show how this distribution dependence can be handled within a change-of-probability framework, leading to a well-posed separated control problem. We derive a Zakai equation with a specific structure for the unnormalized filter, and show that the corresponding value function satisfies a dynamic programming principle. This yields a Bellman equation posed on a convex subset of a Wasserstein space, characterizing the optimal control problem under partial observation.</description>

      <title>Contraction of R\'enyi Divergences for Discrete Channels: Properties and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores properties of Strong Data-Processing constants for R\'enyi Divergences. Parallels are made with the well-studied $\varphi$-Divergences, and it is shown that the order $\alpha$ of R\'enyi Divergences dictates whether certain properties of the contraction of $\varphi$-Divergences are mirrored or not. In particular, we demonstrate that when $\alpha&gt;1$, the contraction properties can deviate quite strikingly from those of $\varphi$-Divergences. We also uncover specific characteristics of contraction for the $\infty$-R\'enyi Divergence and relate it to $\varepsilon$-Local Differential Privacy. The results are then applied to bound the speed of convergence of Markov chains, where we argue that the contraction of R\'enyi Divergences offers a new perspective on the contraction of $L^\alpha$-norms commonly studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic probability approach to loopholes in CHSH experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the CHSH inequality from an informational, timing-sensitive viewpoint using game-theoretic probability, which avoids assuming an underlying probability space. The locality loophole and the measurement-dependence (``freedom-of-choice'') loophole are reformulated as structural constraints in a sequential hidden-variable game between Scientists and Nature. We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}$-transforms for Non-Hermitian Matrices: A Spherical Integral Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between the formalism of $\mathcal{R}$-transforms for non-Hermitian random matrices and the framework of spherical integrals, using the replica method. This connection was previously proved in the Hermitian setting and in the case of bi-invariant random matrices. We show that the $\mathcal{R}$-transforms used in the non-Hermitian context in fact originate from a single scalar function of two variables. This provides a new and transparent way to compute $\mathcal{R}$-transforms, which until now had been known only in restricted cases such as bi-invariant, Hermitian, or elliptic ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a randomized-tamed Milstein scheme for stochastic differential equations whose drift coefficient exhibits superlinear growth in the state variable and limited temporal regularity, quantified by $\beta$-H\"older continuity with $\beta \in (0,1]$. The scheme combines a taming mechanism to control the superlinear state dependence with a drift randomization strategy designed to address the challenges posed by low temporal regularity. Under suitable assumptions on temporal smoothness, the scheme achieves an optimal strong $\mathscr{L}^p$-convergence rate of order one.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Laplacian torsional rigidity with negative Robin boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by pioneering works of Bandle and Wagner, given a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^d$ with $d\ge3$, we consider the Robin-Laplacian torsional rigidity $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ with negative boundary parameter $\alpha$ and we show that sharp inequalities for $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ hold if $|\alpha|$ is small enough. In particular, we prove that, if $|\alpha|$ is smaller than the first non-trivial Steklov-Laplacian eigenvalue, then the ball maximises $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ among all convex domains under perimeter or volume constraints.This solves an open problem raised by Bandle and Wagner. We also prove the result in the planar case among simply connected sets and under perimeter constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and explicitly solves a class of long-term average impulse control problems and a related class of singular control problems. The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such as the optimal long-term management of renewable resources and financial portfolio management. A large class of admissible policies is identified over which the agent seeks to maximize her long-term average reward, consisting of a running reward and income from either discrete impulses or singular actions. The long-term expected total reward and its relation to overtaking optimality is also considered. Sensitivity analysis with regard to the parameters of the impulse control model are performed. Key connections between the impulse and singular control problems are displayed.</description>

      <title>Progress on the Courtade-Kumar Conjecture: Optimal High-Noise Entropy Bounds and Generalized Coordinate-wise Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Courtade-Kumar conjecture posits that dictatorship functions maximize the mutual information between the function's output and a noisy version of its input over the Boolean hypercube. We present two significant advancements related to this conjecture. First, we resolve an open question posed by Courtade and Kumar, proving that for any Boolean function (regardless of bias), the sum of mutual information between the function's output and the individual noisy input coordinates is bounded by $1-H(\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the noise parameter of the Binary Symmetric Channel. This generalizes their previous result which was restricted to balanced Boolean functions. Second, we advance the study of the main conjecture in the high noise regime. We establish an optimal error bound of $O(\lambda^2)$ for the asymptotic entropy expansion, where $\lambda = (1-2\alpha)^2$, improving upon the previous best-known bounds. This refined analysis leads to a sharp, linear Fourier concentration bound for highly informative functions and significantly extends the range of the noise parameter $\lambda$ for which the conjecture is proven to hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mixing times for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a circle of length $N$ with $k$ particles. We show that the mixing time is of order $N^2 \min(k,N-k)^{-1/2}$, and that the cutoff phenomenon does not occur. This confirms behavior which was separately predicted by Jara, Lacoin and Peres, and it is more broadly believed to hold for integrable models in the KPZ-universalty class. Our arguments rely on a connection to periodic last passage percolation with a detailed analysis of flat geodesics, as well as a novel random extension and time shift argument for last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization and hydrodynamic limit of non-gradient exclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the non-gradient exclusion process, we prove the quantitative homogenization of the diffusion matrix and the conductivity by local functions. The proof relies on the renormalization approach developed by Armstrong, Kuusi, Mourrat, and Smart, while the new challenge here is the hard core constraint of particle number on every site. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is proposed to lift the configuration to a larger space without exclusion, and a gradient coupling between two systems is applied to capture the spatial cancellation. We then strengthen the convergence rate to be uniform concerning the density, and integrate it into the work by Funaki, Uchiyama, and Yau [IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 77 (1996), pp. 1-40.] to yield a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. Our new approach avoids showing the characterization of closed forms and provides stronger results. The extension is discussed for the model in the presence of disorder on the bonds.</description>

      <title>Existence and Convergence of Interacting Particle Systems on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general existence and convergence result for interacting particle systems on locally finite graphs with possibly unbounded degrees or jump rates. We allow the local state space to be Polish, and the jumps at a site to affect the states of its neighbours. The two common assumptions on interacting particle systems are uniform bounds on degrees and jump rates. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and allow for vertices with high degrees or rapid jumps. We introduce new assumptions ensuring that such vertices are placed sufficiently apart from each other and hence the process does not blow up. Our assumptions involve finitude of certain weighted connective constants on the square graph of the underlying graph and our proofs proceed by showing that these assumptions imply non-percolation of the Poisson graphical construction. For some random graph models, we give practically verifiable sufficient conditions under which our assumptions hold almost surely. These conditions involve exponential growth of a fractional moment sum of probabilities of self-avoiding walks from each vertex and that of product moments of fixed powers of jump rates. Using these conditions, we show the existence of interacting particle systems with possibly unbounded jump rates like contact processes, consensus formation models, evolutionary models, etc., on random graphs which can lack uniform bounds on degrees almost surely, e.g., long-range percolations on quasi-transitive graphs, and geometric random graphs on Delone sets.</description>

Abstract: We study a general limiting framework for the convergence of sequences of additive functionals of diffusions to L\'evy subordinators, and provide explicit sufficient conditions that both ensure convergence and characterize the law of the limit. As an application, we identify a novel limiting regime for Wright-Fisher and Feller diffusions in the reflecting case and describe the corresponding limiting subordinator. This work is motivated by, and has applications in, neuroscience, where reflected diffusions are used to parametrize synchrony in doubly-stochastic models of spiking activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faber-Krahn functions provide lower bounds on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian and are useful because they imply heat kernel upper bounds. In this paper, we are interested in Faber-Krahn functions and heat kernel estimates for a certain class of graphs consisting of "sufficiently nice pages" (satisfying a Harnack inequality) glued together via a "sufficiently nice spine." For such graphs, we obtain a relative Faber-Krahn function in terms of the Faber-Krahn functions on the pages. The corresponding heat kernel upper bound involves the volumes on the various pages. In the case our graphs satisfy a property we call "book-like" and the spine is appropriately transient, we provide a matching lower bound for the heat kernel between two points on the gluing spine.</description>

      <title>van den Berg-Kesten--type correlation inequalities for disjoint polymers in the KPZ universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical percolation theory, the van den Berg-Kesten (BK) inequality is a fundamental tool that shows that disjoint events induce negative conditionings on each other. The inequality also holds in the context of last passage percolation (LPP), which is the zero temperature limit of polymer models and an important subclass in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Recently, an analog of the BK inequality was discovered in the context of zero temperature line ensembles and the scaling limit of LPP, where it was used to study upper tail probabilities of the weight and the scaling limit of geodesics under such upper tail conditionings. However, while it has become apparent that such an inequality in the positive temperature setting would have a number of applications, it seems likely that a direct generalization of the zero temperature inequality would not hold. In this work we prove a version of the BK inequality for the KPZ line ensemble and the continuum directed random polymer. We do so by working with the log gamma polymer, making use of its integrability and the geometric RSK correspondence. Our inequality serves as a key input in analyzing the KPZ line ensemble and proving sharp upper tail estimates of the KPZ equation in arXiv:2208.08922, and proving convergence of the continuum directed random polymer to Brownian bridge under the upper tail event in arXiv:2311.12009. The crucial role of integrability in the validity of such an inequality is highlighted via a counter-example for a non-integrable model.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical methods are developed to characterize the asymptotics of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the number of hidden units, data samples in the sequence, hidden state updates, and training steps simultaneously grow to infinity. In the case of an RNN with a simplified weight matrix, we prove the convergence of the RNN to the solution of an infinite-dimensional ODE coupled with the fixed point of a random algebraic equation. The analysis requires addressing several challenges which are unique to RNNs. In typical mean-field applications (e.g., feedforward neural networks), discrete updates are of magnitude $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ and the number of updates is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Therefore, the system can be represented as an Euler approximation of an appropriate ODE/PDE, which it will converge to as $N \rightarrow \infty$. However, the RNN hidden layer updates are $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, RNNs cannot be represented as a discretization of an ODE/PDE and standard mean-field techniques cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a fixed point analysis for the evolution of the RNN memory states, with convergence estimates in terms of the number of update steps and the number of hidden units. The RNN hidden layer is studied as a function in a Sobolev space, whose evolution is governed by the data sequence (a Markov chain), the parameter updates, and its dependence on the RNN hidden layer at the previous time step. Due to the strong correlation between updates, a Poisson equation must be used to bound the fluctuations of the RNN around its limit equation. These mathematical methods give rise to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) limits for RNNs trained on data sequences as the number of data samples and size of the neural network grow to infinity.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of points in general position in a random subset of finite $3$-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{d},p)$ be the maximum possible size of a point set in general position in the $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. In this note, we determine the order of magnitude of $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{3},p)$ up to a polylogarithmic factor by proving a balanced supersaturation result for the sets of $4$ points in the same plane.</description>

      <title>On Bayesian Neural Networks with Dependent and Possibly Heavy-Tailed Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent and possibly heavy-tailed weights, as introduced in Lee et al. 2023, to address limitations of the standard Gaussian prior. It has been proved in Lee et al. 2023 that, as the number of nodes in the hidden layers grows large, according to a sequential and ordered limit, the law of the output converges weakly to a Gaussian mixture. Among our results, we present sufficient conditions on the model parameters (the activation function and the associated L\'evy measures) which ensure that the sequential limit is independent of the order. Next, we study the neural network through the lens of the posterior distribution with a Gaussian likelihood. If the random covariance matrix of the infinite-width limit is positive definite under the prior, we identify the posterior distribution of the output in the wide-width limit according to a sequential regime. Remarkably, we provide mild sufficient conditions to ensure the aforementioned invertibility of the random covariance matrix under the prior, thereby extending the results in L. Carvalho et al. 2025. We illustrate our findings using numerical simulations.</description>
