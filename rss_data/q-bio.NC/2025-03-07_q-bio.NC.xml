      <title>Neural Models of Task Adaptation: A Tutorial on Spiking Networks for Executive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding cognitive flexibility and task-switching mechanisms in neural systems requires biologically plausible computational models. This tutorial presents a step-by-step approach to constructing a spiking neural network (SNN) that simulates task-switching dynamics within the cognitive control network. The model incorporates biologically realistic features, including lateral inhibition, adaptive synaptic weights through unsupervised Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), and precise neuronal parameterization within physiologically relevant ranges. The SNN is implemented using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, which represent excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) populations. We utilize two real-world datasets as tasks, demonstrating how the network learns and dynamically switches between them. Experimental design follows cognitive psychology paradigms to analyze neural adaptation, synaptic weight modifications, and emergent behaviors such as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), Long-Term Depression (LTD), and Task-Set Reconfiguration (TSR). Through a series of structured experiments, this tutorial illustrates how variations in task-switching intervals affect performance and multitasking efficiency. The results align with empirically observed neuronal responses, offering insights into the computational underpinnings of executive function. By following this tutorial, researchers can develop and extend biologically inspired SNN models for studying cognitive processes and neural adaptation.</description>

      <title>Node-reconfiguring multilayer networks of human brain function</title>

Abstract: Functional brain network properties are heavily influenced by how the the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), i.e., predetermined collections of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement voxels, as nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines, which can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer links quantify the overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs with intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.</description>

      <title>Functional dissociations versus post-hoc selection: Moving beyond the Stockart et al. (2025) compromise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stockart et al. (2025) recommend guidelines for best practices in the field of unconscious cognition. However, they condone the repeatedly criticized technique of excluding trials with high visibility ratings or of participants with high sensitivity for the critical stimulus. Based on standard signal detection theory for discrimination judgments, we show that post-hoc trial selection only isolates points of neutral response bias but remains consistent with uncomfortably high levels of sensitivity. We argue that post-hoc selection constitutes a sampling fallacy that capitalizes on chance, generates regression artifacts, and wrongly ascribes unconscious processing to stimulus conditions that may be far from indiscriminable. As an alternative, we advocate the study of functional dissociations, where direct (D) and indirect (I) measures are conceptualized as spanning up a two-dimensional D-I-space and where single, sensitivity, and double dissociations appear as distinct curve patterns. While Stockart et al.'s recommendations cover only a single line of that space where D is close to zero, functional dissociations can utilize the entire space, circumventing requirements like null visibility and exhaustive reliability, and allowing for the planful measurement of theoretically meaningful functional relationships between experimentally controlled variables.</description>

      <title>Targeting C99 Mediated Metabolic Disruptions with Ketone Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease</title>

Abstract: The role of ketone bodies in Alzheimers disease (AD) remains incompletely understood, particularly regarding their influence on amyloid pathology. While beta}hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been implicated in neuroprotection, direct evidence for its effects on amyloid beta(Abeta) deposition, aggregation, or clearance is lacking. Furthermore, whether BHB acts as a disease modifying factor or merely confers transient metabolic benefits remains unclear. Addressing this gap is crucial for evaluating the therapeutic potential of ketone metabolism in AD. Here, we investigated the impact of ketone bodies on amyloidogenic toxicity using a Drosophila melanogaster model with targeted expression of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta secretase 1 (BACE1), Abeta, and the C99 fragment, an essential intermediate in Abeta generation. Surprisingly, we found that Abeta alone elicited minimal neurotoxicity, whereas C99 expression induced pronounced pathological effects, suggesting a critical, underappreciated role of C99 in AD progression. Further analysis revealed that C99 driven toxicity was associated with autophagic and lysosomal dysfunction, leading to impaired protein clearance, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Using confocal microscopy and lysosomal pH sensitive markers, we demonstrated that BHB treatment restored lysosomal function and alleviated these pathological changes. Protein protein interaction network analysis in C99 expressing Drosophila brains identified protein phosphatase methylesterase 1 (PPME1) activation as a key driver of autophagic impairment, further supported by machine learning predictions. Finally, mathematical similarity analysis of PPI networks suggested that BHB may exert its neuroprotective effects through mTOR inhibition, positioning it as a potential endogenous modulator of AD related pathology.</description>

      <title>Can We Talk Models Into Seeing the World Differently?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional vision-only models, vision language models (VLMs) offer an intuitive way to access visual content through language prompting by combining a large language model (LLM) with a vision encoder. However, both the LLM and the vision encoder come with their own set of biases, cue preferences, and shortcuts, which have been rigorously studied in uni-modal models. A timely question is how such (potentially misaligned) biases and cue preferences behave under multi-modal fusion in VLMs. As a first step towards a better understanding, we investigate a particularly well-studied vision-only bias - the texture vs. shape bias and the dominance of local over global information. As expected, we find that VLMs inherit this bias to some extent from their vision encoders. Surprisingly, the multi-modality alone proves to have important effects on the model behavior, i.e., the joint training and the language querying change the way visual cues are processed. While this direct impact of language-informed training on a model's visual perception is intriguing, it raises further questions on our ability to actively steer a model's output so that its prediction is based on particular visual cues of the user's choice. Interestingly, VLMs have an inherent tendency to recognize objects based on shape information, which is different from what a plain vision encoder would do. Further active steering towards shape-based classifications through language prompts is however limited. In contrast, active VLM steering towards texture-based decisions through simple natural language prompts is often more successful.
