      <title>Differential geometry using quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the basis of the quaternionic differential geometry ($\mathbbm H$DG) initiated in a previous article. The usual concepts of curves and surfaces are generalized to quaternionic constraints, as well as the curvature and torsion concepts, differential forms, directional derivatives and the structural equations. The analogy between the quaternionic and the real geometries is obtained using a matrix representation of quaternions. The results evidences the quaternionic formalism as a suitable language to differential geometry that can be useful in various directions of future investigation.</description>

      <title>Geodesic orbit and weak symmetric spray manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the geodesic orbit and weakly symmetric properties in homogeneous spray geometry. When a homogeneous spray manifold is endowed with a reductive decomposition, we can use the spray vector field to describe these properties, and prove that a weakly symmetric spray manifold must be geodesic orbit, which generalizes its analog in homogeneous Riemannian and Finsler geometries.</description>

      <title>Elastic Curves with Variable Bending Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary points of the bending energy of curves $\gamma\colon[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}^n$ subject to constraints on the arc-length and total torsion while simultaneously allowing for a variable bending stiffness along the arc-length of the curve. Physically, this can be understood as a model for an elastic wire with isotropic cross-section of varying thickness. We derive the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations for variations that are compactly supported away from the end points thus obtaining characterizations for elastic curves with variable bending stiffness. Moreover, we provide a collection of alternative characterizations, e.g., in terms of the curvature function. Adding to numerous known results relating elastic curves to dynamics, we establish connections between elastic curves with variable bending stiffness and damped pendulums and the flow of vortex filaments with finite thickness.</description>

      <title>Newton's method for nonlinear mappings into vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Newton's method for finding zeros of mappings from a manifold $\mathcal{X}$ into a vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$. In this setting a connection on $\mathcal{E}$ is required to render the Newton equation well defined, and a retraction on $\mathcal{X}$ is needed to compute a Newton update. We discuss local convergence in terms of suitable differentiability concepts, using a Banach space variant of a Riemannian distance. We also carry over an affine covariant damping strategy to our setting. Finally, we discuss two simple applications of our approach, namely, finding fixed points of vector fields and stationary points of functionals.</description>

      <title>Optimal rigidity estimates for varifolds almost minimizing the Willmore energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integral $2$-varifold $V=\underline{v}(\Sigma,\theta_{\ge 1})$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with generalized mean curvature $H\in L^2$ such that $\mu(\mathbb{R}^n)=4\pi$ and $\int_{\Sigma}|H|^2d\mu\le 16\pi(1+\delta^2)$ , we show that $\Sigma$ is $W^{2,2}$ close to the standard embedding of the round sphere in a quantitative way when $\delta&lt; \delta_0\ll 1$. For $n=3$, we prove that the sharp constant is $\delta_0^2=2\pi$.</description>

      <title>Manifolds for which Huber's Theorem holds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of Huber's Theorem to higher dimensions with $L^\frac{n}{2}$ bounded scalar curvature have been extensively studied over the years. In this paper, we delve into the properties of conformal metrics on a punctured ball with $\|R\|_{L^\frac{n}{2}}&lt;+\infty$, aiming to identify necessary geometric constraints for Huber's theorem to be applicable. Unexpectedly, such metrics are more rigid than we initially anticipated. For instance, we found that the volume density at infinity is precisely one, and the blow-down of the metric is $\mathbb{R}^n$. Specifically, in four dimensions, we derive the $L^2$-integrability of the Ricci curvature, which directly leads to the conclusion that the Pfaffian 4-form is integrable and adheres to a Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula, previously verified by Lu and Wang under the assumption that the second fundamental form belongs to $L^4$, remains valid for $R \in L^2$. Consequently, on an orientable 4-dimensional manifold conformal to a domain in a closed manifold, Huber's Theorem holds when $R \in L^2$, if and only if the negative part of the Pfaffian 4-form is integrable.</description>

      <title>Einstein metrics from the Calabi ansatz via Derdzi\'nski duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on results of Derdzi\'nski's from the 80's, we classify conformally K\"ahler, $U(2)$-invariant, Einstein metrics on the total space of $\mathcal{O}(-m)$, for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. This yields infinitely many $1$-parameter families of metrics exhibiting several different behaviours including asymptotically hyperbolic metrics (more specifically of Poincar\'e type), ALF metrics, and metrics which compactify to a Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{H}_m$ with a cone singularity along the "divisor at infinity". This allows us to investigate transitions between behaviours yielding interesting results. For instance, we show that a Ricci--flat ALF metric known as the Taub-bolt metric can be obtained as the limit of a family of cone angle Einstein metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}}^2$ when the cone angle converges to zero.
  We also construct Einstein metrics which are asymptotically hyperbolic and conformal to a scalar-flat K\"ahler metric. Such metrics cannot be obtained by applying Derdzi\'nski's theorem.</description>

      <title>Skew parallelogram nets and universal factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain many objects of discrete differential geometry as reductions of skew parallelogram nets, a system of lattice equations that may be formulated for any unit associative algebra. The Lax representation is linear in the spectral parameter, and paths in the lattice give rise to polynomial dependencies. We prove that generic polynomials in complex two by two matrices factorize, implying that skew parallelogram nets encompass all systems with such a polynomial representation. We demonstrate factorization in the context of discrete curves by constructing pairs of B\"acklund transformations that induce Euclidean motions on discrete elastic rods. More generally, we define a hierarchy of discrete curves by requiring such an invariance after an integer number of B\"acklund transformations. Moreover, we provide the factorization explicitly for discrete constant curvature surfaces and reveal that they are slices in certain 4D cross-ratio systems. Encompassing the discrete DPW method, this interpretation constructs such surfaces from given discrete holomorphic maps.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Yang-Mills wormholes haunted by a phantom field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study wormhole spacetimes in the framework of the static spherically symmetric SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a phantom scalar field. We show rigorously the existence of an infinite sequence of symmetric wormhole solutions, labelled by the number of zeros of the Yang-Mills potential. These solutions have previously been discovered numerically. Mathematically, the problem resembles the pure Einstein-Yang-Mills system for black hole initial conditions, which was well-studied in the 90s. The main difference in the present work is that the coupling to the phantom field adds a non-trivial degree of complexity to the analysis. After proving the existence of the symmetric wormhole solutions, we also present numerical evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Conformally symplectic structures and the Lefschetz condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short note provides a symplectic analogue of Vaisman's theorem in complex geometry. Namely, for any compact symplectic manifold satisfying the hard Lefschetz condition in degree 1, every locally conformally symplectic structure is in fact globally conformally symplectic, whenever there is a mutually compatible almost complex structure.</description>
