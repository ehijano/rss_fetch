      <title>A Comparative Study of Neural Surface Reconstruction for Scientific Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comparative study evaluates various neural surface reconstruction methods, particularly focusing on their implications for scientific visualization through reconstructing 3D surfaces via multi-view rendering images. We categorize ten methods into neural radiance fields and neural implicit surfaces, uncovering the benefits of leveraging distance functions (i.e., SDFs and UDFs) to enhance the accuracy and smoothness of the reconstructed surfaces. Our findings highlight the efficiency and quality of NeuS2 for reconstructing closed surfaces and identify NeUDF as a promising candidate for reconstructing open surfaces despite some limitations. By sharing our benchmark dataset, we invite researchers to test the performance of their methods, contributing to the advancement of surface reconstruction solutions for scientific visualization.</description>

      <title>StackFLOW: Monocular Human-Object Reconstruction by Stacked Normalizing Flow with Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and capturing the 3D spatial arrangement of the human and the object is the key to perceiving 3D human-object interaction from monocular images. In this work, we propose to use the Human-Object Offset between anchors which are densely sampled from the surface of human mesh and object mesh to represent human-object spatial relation. Compared with previous works which use contact map or implicit distance filed to encode 3D human-object spatial relations, our method is a simple and efficient way to encode the highly detailed spatial correlation between the human and object. Based on this representation, we propose Stacked Normalizing Flow (StackFLOW) to infer the posterior distribution of human-object spatial relations from the image. During the optimization stage, we finetune the human body pose and object 6D pose by maximizing the likelihood of samples based on this posterior distribution and minimizing the 2D-3D corresponding reprojection loss. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves impressive results on two challenging benchmarks, BEHAVE and InterCap datasets.</description>

      <title>Monocular Human-Object Reconstruction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20566v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the prior knowledge of the 3D human-object spatial relation is crucial for reconstructing human-object interaction from images and understanding how humans interact with objects in 3D space. Previous works learn this prior from datasets collected in controlled environments, but due to the diversity of domains, they struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present a 2D-supervised method that learns the 3D human-object spatial relation prior purely from 2D images in the wild. Our method utilizes a flow-based neural network to learn the prior distribution of the 2D human-object keypoint layout and viewports for each image in the dataset. The effectiveness of the prior learned from 2D images is demonstrated on the human-object reconstruction task by applying the prior to tune the relative pose between the human and the object during the post-optimization stage. To validate and benchmark our method on in-the-wild images, we collect the WildHOI dataset from the YouTube website, which consists of various interactions with 8 objects in real-world scenarios. We conduct the experiments on the indoor BEHAVE dataset and the outdoor WildHOI dataset. The results show that our method achieves almost comparable performance with fully 3D supervised methods on the BEHAVE dataset, even if we have only utilized the 2D layout information, and outperforms previous methods in terms of generality and interaction diversity on in-the-wild images.</description>

      <title>RDA-INR: Riemannian Diffeomorphic Autoencoding via Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphic registration frameworks such as Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) are used in computer graphics and the medical domain for atlas building, statistical latent modeling, and pairwise and groupwise registration. In recent years, researchers have developed neural network-based approaches regarding diffeomorphic registration to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of traditional methods. In this work, we focus on a limitation of neural network-based atlas building and statistical latent modeling methods, namely that they either are (i) resolution dependent or (ii) disregard any data- or problem-specific geometry needed for proper mean-variance analysis. In particular, we overcome this limitation by designing a novel encoder based on resolution-independent implicit neural representations. The encoder achieves resolution invariance for LDDMM-based statistical latent modeling. Additionally, the encoder adds LDDMM Riemannian geometry to resolution-independent deep learning models for statistical latent modeling. We investigate how the Riemannian geometry improves latent modeling and is required for a proper mean-variance analysis. To highlight the benefit of resolution independence for LDDMM-based data variability modeling, we show that our approach outperforms current neural network-based LDDMM latent code models. Our work paves the way for more research into how Riemannian geometry, shape respectively image analysis, and deep learning can be combined.</description>
