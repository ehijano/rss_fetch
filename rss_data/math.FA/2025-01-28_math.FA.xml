      <title>Pervasiveness of $\mathcal{L}^r(E,F)$ in $\mathcal{L}^r(E,F^{\delta})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E, F$ be Archimedean Riesz spaces, and let $F^{\delta}$ denote an order completion of $F$. In this note, we provide necessary conditions under which the space of regular operators $\mathcal{L}^r(E, F)$ is pervasive in $\mathcal{L}^r(E, F^{\delta})$. Pervasiveness of $\mathcal{L}^r(E, F)$ in $\mathcal{L}^r(E, F^{\delta})$ implies that the Riesz completion of $ \mathcal{L}^r(E, F)$ can be realized as a Riesz subspace of $ \mathcal{L}^r(E, F^{\delta}$. It also ensures that the regular part of the space of order continuous operators $\mathcal{L}^{oc}(E, F)$ forms a band of $\mathcal{L}^r(E, F)$. Furthermore, the positive part $T^+$ of any operator $T \in \mathcal{L}^r(E, F)$, provided it exists, is given by the Riesz-Kantorovich formula. The results apply in particular to cases where $E = \ell_0^{\infty}$, $E = c$, or $F$ is atomic, and they provide solutions to some problems posed in [3] and [16].</description>

      <title>Local Minimizers in Second Order Mean-field Games Systems with Choquard Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field Games systems (MFGs) serve as paradigms to describe the games among a huge number of players. In this paper, we consider the ergodic Mean-field Games systems in the bounded domain with Neumann boundary conditions and the decreasing Choquard coupling. Our results provide sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to MFGs with Choquard-type coupling. More specifically, in the mass-subcritical and critical regimes, the solutions are characterized as global minimizers of the associated energy functional. In the case of mass supercritical exponents, up to the Sobolev critical threshold, the solutions correspond to local minimizers. The proof is based on variational methods, in which the regularization approximation, convex duality argument, elliptic regularity and Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality are comprehensively employed.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity of rearrangement-invariant norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rearrangement-invariant spaces $X$ over $[0,\infty)$ for which there exists a function $h:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that \[ \|D_rf\|_X = h(r)\|f\|_X \] for all $f\in X$ and all $r&gt;0$, where $D_r$ is the dilation operator. It is shown that this may hold only if $h(r)=r^{-\frac1p}$ for all $r&gt;0$, in which case the norm $\|\cdot\|_X$ is called $p$-homogeneous. We investigate which types of r.i. spaces satisfy this condition and show some important embedding properties.</description>

Abstract: We give an elementary proof of a recent result of B. Cole that the Agler norm of a function is determined by its norm on commuting tuples of nilpotent matrices. The proof is variation on a standard cone separation argument. The topic is closely related to the Eschmeier-Patton-Putinar formulation of Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er interpolation.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the unit ball of ${\mathcal L}(X,Y^*)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the geometry of the unit ball of the space of operators ${\mathcal L}(X,Y^*)$, by considering the projective tensor product $X\hat{\otimes}_{\pi} Y$ as a predual. We prove that if an elementary tensor (rank one operator) of the form $x_0^*\otimes y_0^* $ in the unit sphere $ S_{{\mathcal L}(X,Y^*)}$ is a $w^*$-strongly extreme point of unit ball, then $x_0^*$ is $w^*$-strongly extreme point of unit ball of $X^*$ and $y_0^*$ is $w^*$-strongly extreme point of the unit ball of $Y^*$. We show that similar conclusion holds if the rank one operator is a point of weak$^*$-weak continuity for the identity mapping on the unit sphere of ${\mathcal L}(X,Y^*)$. We also study extremal phenomenon in the unit ball of ${\mathcal L}(X,Y^*)^*$. We show that if a point $z\in S_{{\mathcal L}(X,Y^*)^*}$ is a $w^*$-strongly extreme point of the unit ball, then $z=x\otimes y$ for some $w^*$-strongly extreme points $x\in S_X$ and $y\in S_Y$, provided the space of compact operators, $\mathcal{K}(X,Y^*)$ is separating for $X\hat{\otimes}_{\pi} Y$.</description>

      <title>Existence and Blow-up Profiles of Ground States in Second Order Multi-population Mean-field Games Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the variational structure to study the existence and asymptotic profiles of ground states in multi-population ergodic Mean-field Games systems subject to some local couplings with mass critical exponents. Of concern the attractive and repulsive interactions, we impose some mild conditions on trapping potentials and firstly classify the existence of ground states in terms of intra-population and interaction coefficients. Next, as the intra-population and inter-population coefficients approach some critical values, we show the ground states blow up at one of global minima of potential functions and the corresponding profiles are captured by ground states to potential-free Mean-field Games systems for single population up to translations and rescalings. Moreover, under certain types of potential functions, we establish the refined blow-up profiles of corresponding ground states. In particular, we show that the ground states concentrate at the flattest global minima of potentials.</description>

      <title>p-Summing weighted holomorphic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an open subset $U$ of a complex Banach space $E$, a weight $v$ on $U$, and a complex Banach space $F$, let $\mathcal{H}^\infty_v(U,F)$ denote the Banach space of all weighted holomorphic mappings $f\colon U\to F$, under the weighted supremum norm $\left\|f\right\|_v:=\sup\left\{v(x)\left\|f(x)\right\|\colon x\in U\right\}$. In this paper, we introduce and study the class $\Pi_p^{\mathcal{H}^\infty_v}(U,F)$ of $p$-summing weighted holomorphic mappings. We prove that it is an injective Banach ideal of weighted holomorphic mappings which is not generated by composition. Variants for weighted holomorphic mappings of Pietsch Domination Theorem, Pietsch Factorization Theorem and Maurey Extrapolation Theorem are presented. We also identify the spaces of $p$-summing weighted holomorphic mappings from $U$ into $F^*$ under the norm $\pi^{\mathcal{H}^\infty_v}_p$ with the duals of $F$-valued $\mathcal{H}^\infty_v$-molecules on $U$ under a suitable version $d^{\mathcal{H}^\infty_v}_{p^*}$ of the Chevet--Saphar tensor norms.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [32, 11, 13]). There is however much room for non-commutative results. Sz.-Nagy [43] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate families of contractions to (in general non-commuting) families of unitaries. To complement this, the present work extends this discrete-time result to families of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) an explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) a full proof with an explicit construction which utilises the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S{\l}oci\'{n}ski [39, 40]; and 3) a second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups. We then reformulate such non-commuting systems naturally as semigroups defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}$, deriving weak approximation and residuality results in the process. Under this setup we discuss applications to Chernoff approximations, random evolutions, and evolution families.</description>

      <title>Image resizing by neural network operators and their convergence rate with respect to the $L^p$-norm and the dissimilarity index defined through the continuous SSIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In literature, several algorithms for imaging based on interpolation or approximation methods are available. The implementation of theoretical processes highlighted the necessity of providing theoretical frameworks for the convergence and error estimate analysis to support the experimental setups. In this paper, we establish new techniques for deriving quantitative estimates for the order of approximation for multivariate linear operators of the pointwise-type, with respect to the $L^p$-norm and to the so-called dissimilarity index defined through the continuous SSIM. In particular, we consider a family of approximation operators known as neural network (NN) operators, that have been widely studied in the last years in view of their connection with the theory of artificial neural networks. For these operators, we first establish sharp estimates in case of $C^1$ and piecewise (everywhere defined) $C^1$-functions. Then, the case of functions modeling digital images is considered, and specific quantitative estimates are achieved, including those with respect to the mentioned dissimilarity index. Moreover, the above analysis has also been extended to $L^p$-spaces, using a new constructive technique, in which the multivariate averaged modulus of smoothness has been employed. Finally, numerical experiments of image resizing have been given to support the theoretical results. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated through similarity indexes such as SSIM, likelihood index (S-index) and PSNR, and compared with other rescaling methods, including bilinear, bicubic, and upscaling-de la Vall\'ee-Poussin interpolation (u-VPI). Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method for image processing tasks, particularly in terms of the aforementioned SSIM, and are consistent with the provided theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>$F_\sigma$-ideals, colorings, and representation in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent works by L. Drewnowski and I. Labuda and J. Mart\'inez et al., non-pathological analytic \( P \)-ideals and non-pathological \( F_\sigma \)-ideals have been characterized and studied in terms of their representations by a sequence \( (x_n)_n \) in a Banach space, as \( \mathcal{C}((x_n)_n) \) and \( \mathcal{B}((x_n)_n) \). The ideal \( \mathcal{C}((x_n)_n) \) consists of sets where the series \( \sum_{n \in A} x_n \) is unconditionally convergent, while \( \mathcal{B}((x_n)_n) \) involves weak unconditional convergence.
  In this paper, we further study these representations and provide effective descriptions of \( \mathcal{B} \)- and \( \mathcal{C} \)-ideals in the universal spaces \( C([0,1]) \) and \( C(2^{\mathbb{N}}) \), addressing a question posed by Borodulin-Nadzieja et al. A key aspect of our study is the role of the space \( c_0 \) in these representations. We focus particularly on \( \mathcal{B} \)-representations in spaces containing many copies of \( c_0 \), such as \( c_0 \)-saturated spaces of continuous functions.
  A central tool in our analysis is the concept of \( c \)-coloring ideals, which arise from homogeneous sets of continuous colorings. These ideals, generated by homogeneous sets of 2-colorings, exhibit a rich combinatorial structure. Among our results, we prove that for \( d \geq 3 \), the random \( d \)-homogeneous ideal is pathological,
  we construct hereditarily non-pathological universal \( c \)-coloring ideals, and we show that every \( \mathcal{B} \)-ideal represented in \( C(K) \), for \( K \) countable, contains a \( c \)-coloring ideal. Furthermore, by leveraging \( c \)-coloring ideals, we provide examples of \( \mathcal{B} \)-ideals that are not \( \mathcal{B} \)-representable in \( c_0 \). These findings highlight the interplay between combinatorial properties of ideals and their representations in Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: Given a uniform algebra A on a compact Hausdorff space X and a point x in X, denote by M_x the ideal of functions in A that vanish at x and by J_x the ideal of functions in A that vanish on a neighborhood of x. It is shown that for each integer m greater than or equal to 2, there exists a compact plane set K containing the origin such that in R(K) the closure of J_x contains M_x for every x in K minus {0} and the closure of J_0 contains M_0^m but does not contain M_0^{m-1}. This result establishes a recent conjecture of Alexander Izzo. For the proof we introduce a construction that could be described as taking square roots of Swiss cheeses.</description>

Abstract: We show that the maximal non-central hyperplane sections of the regular n-simplex of side-length sqrt 2 at a fixed distance t to the centroid are those parallel to a face of the simplex, if $\sqrt{(n-2)/(3(n+1))} &lt; t &lt; \sqrt{(n-1)/(2(n+1))}$ and $n&gt;4$. For $n=4$, the same is true in a slightly smaller range for t. This adds to a previous result for $\sqrt{(n-1)/(2(n+1))} &lt; t &lt; \sqrt{n/(n+1)}$. For $n=2,3$, we determine the maximal and the minimal sections for all distances t to the centroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08445v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the stability theorems for the isotropic perturbations of maximal isotropic subspaces in symplectic Banach spaces. Then we prove a stability theorem for the mod $2$ dimensions of kernel of skew-adjoint linear Fredholm relations between real Banach spaces with index $0$. Finally we gives the two path components of the set of skew-adjoint linear Fredholm relations between real Banach spaces with indices $0$.</description>

      <title>On maximal hyperplane sections of the unit ball of $l_p$ for $p&gt;2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximal hyperplane section of the $l_\infty^n$-ball, i.e. of the $n$-cube, is the one perpendicular to 1/sqrt 2 (1,1,0, ... ,0), as shown by Ball. Eskenazis, Nayar and Tkocz extended this result to the $l_p^n$-balls for very large $p \ge 10^{15}$. By Oleszkiewicz, Ball's result does not transfer to $l_p^n$ for $2 &lt; p &lt; p_0 \simeq 26.265$. Then the hyperplane section perpendicular to the main diagonal yields a counterexample for large dimensions $n$. We show that the analogue of Ball's result holds in $l_p^n$-balls for all hyperplanes with normal unit vectors $a$, if all coordinates of $a$ have modulus $\le \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}$ and $p$ has distance $\ge 2^{-p}$ to the even integers. Under similar assumptions, we give a Gaussian upper bound for $20 &lt; p &lt; p_0$.</description>

      <title>A formula of local Maslov index and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly express the local Maslov index by a Maslov index in finite dimensional case without symplectic reduction. Then we calculate the Maslov index for the path of pairs of Lagrangian subspaces in triangular form. In particular, we get the Maslov-type index of a given symplectic path in triangle form. As applications, we calculate the splitting numbers of the symplectic matrix in triangle form, dependence of iteration theory on triangular frames and mod 2 Maslov-type index for a real symplectic path. We study the continuity of families of bounded linear relations and families of bounded linear operators acting on closed linear subspaces as technique preparations.</description>

      <title>A R\'enyi entropy interpretation of anti-concentration and noncentral sections of convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Bobkov and Chistyakov's (2015) upper bounds on concentration functions of sums of independent random variables to a multivariate entropic setting. The approach is based on pointwise estimates on densities of sums of independent random vectors uniform on centred Euclidean balls. In this vein, we also obtain sharp bounds on volumes of noncentral sections of isotropic convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Singular extension of critical Sobolev mappings with values into complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [18], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of rough path analysis via fractional calculus, we show how variability can be used to prove the existence of integrals with respect to H\"older continuous multiplicative functionals in the case of Lipschitz coefficients with first order partial derivatives of bounded variation. We discuss applications to certain Gaussian processes, in particular, fractional Brownian motions with Hurst index $\frac13&lt;H\leq \frac12$.</description>

      <title>K-closedness results in noncommutative Lebesgue spaces with filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new general $K$-closedness result in the context of real interpolation of noncommutative Lebesgue spaces involving filtrations. As an application, we derive $K$-closedness results for various classes of noncommutative martingale Hardy spaces, addressing a problem raised by Randrianantoanina. The proof of this general result adapts Bourgain's approach to the real interpolation of classical Hardy spaces on the disk within the framework of noncommutative martingales.</description>
