      <title>Machine learning of the Ising model on a spherical Fibonacci lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Ising model confined to a spherical surface, focusing on its implementation using a Fibonacci lattice. The challenge lies in uniformly covering the spherical surface to enable reliable comparisons with planar models. Monte Carlo simulations and graph convolutional networks(GCNs) are employed to analyze spin configurations at varying temperatures and to identify phase transition temperatures. Although the spherical Fibonacci lattice is sufficiently uniform, there are still some irregular sites, which introduce interesting effects. In the ferromagnetic case, sites with fewer neighbors are more likely to undergo spin flips at low temperatures; however, this is not necessarily true at high temperatures, which could explain why the phase transition temperature is higher compared to the planar Ising model. In the antiferromagnetic case, the presence of irregular sites results in the total energy of the system at zero temperature not being the lowest. Phase transition temperatures are estimated using specific heat analysis and GCNs, revealing $T_C$ values for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. The study underscores the significance of the Fibonacci lattice's geometric properties in understanding spin interactions in microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Generative Neural Reparameterization for Differentiable PDE-constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained optimization is a well-worn technique for acquiring optimal parameters of systems governed by PDEs. However, this approach is limited to providing a single set of optimal parameters per optimization. Given a differentiable PDE solver, if the free parameters are reparameterized as the output of a neural network, that neural network can be trained to learn a map from a probability distribution to the distribution of optimal parameters. This proves useful in the case where there are many well performing local minima for the PDE. We apply this technique to train a neural network that generates optimal parameters that minimize laser-plasma instabilities relevant to laser fusion and show that the neural network generates many well performing and diverse minima.</description>

      <title>Stop using Landau gauge for Tight-binding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal under a commensurate perpendicular magnetic field, tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians are typically constructed using a magnetic unit cell (MUC), which is composed of several unit cells (UC) to satisfy flux quantization. However, when the vector potential is constrained to the Landau gauge, an additional constraint is imposed on the hopping trajectories, further enlarging the TB Hamiltonian and preventing incommensurate atomic rearrangements. In this paper, we demonstrate that this constraint persists, albeit in a weaker form, for any linear vector potential ($\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})$ linear in $\mathbf{r}$). This restriction can only be fully lifted by using a nonlinear vector potential. With a general nonlinear vector potential, a TB Hamiltonian can be constructed that matches the minimal size dictated by flux quantization, even when incommensurate atomic rearrangements occur within the MUC, such as moir\'e reconstructions. For example, as the twist angle $\theta$ of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) approaches zero, the size of the TB Hamiltonian scales as $1/\theta^4$ when using linear vector potentials (including the Landau gauge). In contrast, with a nonlinear vector potential, the size scales more favorably, as $1/\theta^2$, making small-angle TBG models more tractable with TB.</description>

      <title>A general statistical approach to quantum algorithms in a circuit model based on the expectation and standard deviation of each gate separately</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing literature exploring the generalization of quantum algorithms, such that different quantum algorithms are special examples of a more fundamental structure. In this short paper, we provide a general approach to describe quantum algorithms as a quantum state with amplitudes that are constructed from the expected value and standard deviation of each quantum gate or a sub-sequence of gates in the algorithm. The proposed statistical-based description relies on the celebrated Aharonov-Vaidman identity. We present a more fundamental identity that, unlike the previous one, allows us to switch the basis of the states into a desired form.</description>

      <title>Exactly energy-momentum-conserving stochastic differential equations and algorithms for nonlinear Landau-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb collision is a fundamental diffusion process in plasmas that can be described by the Landau-Fokker-Planck (LFP) equation or the stochastic differential equation (SDE). While energy and momentum are conserved exactly in the LFP equation, they are conserved only on average by the conventional corresponding SDEs, suggesting that the underlying stochastic process may not be well-defined by such SDEs. In this study, we derive new SDEs with exact energy-momentum conservation for the Coulomb collision by factorizing the collective effect of field particles into individual particles and enforcing Newton's third law. These SDEs, when interpreted in the Stratonovich sense, have a particularly simple form that represents pure diffusion between particles without drag. Numerical algorithms that preserve discrete conservation laws are developed and benchmarked in various relaxation processes. Techniques to reduce computational complexity are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of topologically protected interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D and "1.5D" problems (in the latter, fields and wave vectors generally have two components, while the mathematical equations can still be reduced to 1D). The 2D Maxwell case, however, is qualitatively different, because the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples presented in the paper are fully consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as was also shown to be the case in 1D and 1.5D.</description>

      <title>A bound state attractor in optical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the nonintegrable dynamics of coherent, solitonic, nonlinear waves, in a spatially nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation relevant to realistic modelling of optical systems: the Schrodinger-Helmholtz equation. We observe a single oscillating, coherent solitary wave emerging from a variety of initial conditions. Using the direct scattering transform of the (integrable) cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that this structure is a bound state, comprising of a primary and secondary soliton whose amplitudes oscillate out of phase. We interpret this as the solitons periodically exchanging mass. We observe this bound state self-organising from a state of incoherent turbulence, and from solitonic structures launched into the system. When a single (primary) solitonic structure is launched, a resonance process between it and waves in the system generates the secondary soliton, resulting in the bound state. Further, when two solitons are initially launched, we show that they can merge if their phases are synchronised when they collide. When the system is launched from a turbulent state comprised of many initial solitons, we propose that the bound state formation is preceded a sequence of binary collisions, in which the mass is transferred on average from the weak soliton to the strong one, with occasional soliton mergers. Both processes lead to increasingly stronger and fewer dominant solitons. The final state -- a solitary double-solitonic bound state surrounded by weakly nonlinear waves -- is robust and ubiquitous. We propose that for nonlocal media, it is a more typical statistical attractor than a single-soliton attractor suggested in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval via media diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies phase retrieval for wave fields, aiming to recover the phase of an incoming wave from multi-plane intensity measurements behind different types of linear and nonlinear media. We show that unique phase retrieval can be achieved by utilizing intensity data produced by multiple media. This uniqueness does not require prescribed boundary conditions for the phase in the incidence plane, in contrast to existing phase retrieval methods based on the transport of intensity equation. Moreover, the uniqueness proofs lead to explicit phase reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to discover new materials with desirable properties is critical for numerous applications from helping mitigate climate change to advances in next generation computing hardware. AI has the potential to accelerate materials discovery and design by more effectively exploring the chemical space compared to other computational methods or by trial-and-error. While substantial progress has been made on AI for materials data, benchmarks, and models, a barrier that has emerged is the lack of publicly available training data and open pre-trained models. To address this, we present a Meta FAIR release of the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) large-scale open dataset and an accompanying set of pre-trained models. OMat24 contains over 110 million density functional theory (DFT) calculations focused on structural and compositional diversity. Our EquiformerV2 models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Matbench Discovery leaderboard and are capable of predicting ground-state stability and formation energies to an F1 score above 0.9 and an accuracy of 20 meV/atom, respectively. We explore the impact of model size, auxiliary denoising objectives, and fine-tuning on performance across a range of datasets including OMat24, MPtraj, and Alexandria. The open release of the OMat24 dataset and models enables the research community to build upon our efforts and drive further advancements in AI-assisted materials science.</description>

      <title>Low-resolution descriptions of model neural activity reveal hidden features and underlying system properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of complex systems such as neural networks is made particularly difficult by the overwhelming number of their interacting components. In the absence of prior knowledge, identifying a small but informative subset of network nodes on which the analysis should focus is a rather challenging task. In this work, we address this problem in the context of a Hopfield model, which is observed through the lenses of low-resolution representations, or decimation mappings, consisting of subgroups of its neurons. The optimal, most informative mappings of the network are defined through a recently developed methodology, the mapping entropy optimisation workflow (MEOW), which performs an unsupervised analysis of the states sampled by the network and identifies those subgroups of spins whose configuration distribution is closest to that of the full, high-resolution model. Which neurons are retained in an optimal mapping is found to critically depend on the properties of the interaction matrix of the network and the level of detail employed to describe the system; by these means, it is thus possible to extract quantitative insight about the underlying properties of the high-resolution model through the analysis of its optimal low-resolution representations. These results show a tight and potentially fruitful relation between the level of detail at which the network is inspected and the type and amount of information that can be gathered from it, and showcase the MEOW approach as a practical, enabling tool for the study of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Extreme time extrapolation capabilities and thermodynamic consistency of physics-inspired Neural Networks for the 3D microstructure evolution of materials via Cahn-Hilliard flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is trained to reproduce the evolution of the spinodal decomposition process in three dimensions as described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A specialized, physics-inspired architecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted evolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration schemes. The method can accurately reproduce the evolution of microstructures not represented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs. Extremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the theoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, consisting of a layered, phase-separated morphology, despite the training set containing only relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution. Quantitative accordance with the decay rate of the Free energy is also demonstrated up to the late coarsening stages, proving that this class of Machine Learning approaches can become a new and powerful tool for the long timescale and high throughput simulation of materials, while retaining thermodynamic consistency and high-accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>
