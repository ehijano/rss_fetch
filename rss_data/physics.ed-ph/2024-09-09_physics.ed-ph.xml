      <title>Modular Study of a Force-Magnetic Coupling System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic-mechanical oscillating system consists of two identical leaf springs, a non-magnetic base, and some magnets. The leaf springs are fixed at the bottom to the non-magnetic base, while the magnet is attached to the top of the leaf springs. This paper investigates the overall motion characteristics of the magnetic-mechanical oscillating system. Adopting the modular modeling concept, we simplify the system into three inter-coupled modules: the leaf springs, magnetic interactions, and the system's dissipation process. We conduct physical modeling and theoretical analysis on these modules and derived the system's dynamic equations. The research indicates that the system is a normal mode system with two degrees of freedom. In addition, we alter parameters and conduct multiple innovative experiments, obtaining intuitive vibration images that characterize the vibration modes and the periodic energy transfer. Furthermore, we employ the simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics simulation to substitute the theory for auxiliary validation, achieving a comprehensive research loop of theory-experiment-simulation. The experimental results show good consistency with the theoretical calculations and simulation results. This research provides a good teaching case for magnetic-coupling complex systems. This modular analysis and rather practical experimental design could solve the previous difficulty that the solution to such problem is too complex, and is conducive to the implementation of education.</description>

      <title>A Snapshot of Relativistic Motion: Visualizing the Terrell Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental visualization of the Terrell effect, an optical phenomenon predicted in 1959 by Roger Penrose and James Terrell, which reveals that the Lorentz contraction of a moving object is not visible in a snapshot photograph. Using fs-laser pulses and a gated intensified camera that allows gating times as short as 300 ps, we achieve a virtual reduction of the speed of light to less than 2 m/s, enabling the visualisation of relativistically moving objects in real time. By capturing light reflected from deliberately Lorentz-contracted objects, our setup effectively reconstructs their visual appearance. This didactic visualization not only commemorates the centennial of Anton Lampa's seminal 1924 paper on relativistic length contraction but also provides the first experimental evidence of the Terrell effect in a laboratory setup. Our results comprise detailed relativistic illustrations, simulations and photographic snapshots of a sphere and a cube, which are animated to velocities close to the speed of light, revealing the apparent rotation effect and the distortion predicted by relativistic theory.</description>
