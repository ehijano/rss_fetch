      <title>On transcendence of non-periodic continued fractions associated with modular forms and arithmetic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is two-folds. Firstly, we establish two sufficient conditions under which the sequence $\{f(n)\pmod{m}: n\geq1\}$ is non-periodic, where $f(n)$ is an arithmetic function. As consequences, we deduce that the sequences associated with the Ramanujan tau function $\tau(n)$ as well as the Fourier coefficients of certain normalized Eisenstein series $E_k(z)$ modulo $m$ are non-periodic. Further, we deduce that the sequence arising from Nathanson's totient function $\Phi(n)$, the classical Euler's totient function $\varphi(n)$, sum of divisor function $\sigma(n)$, their Dirichlet convolution $\sigma*\varphi(n)$, Jordan's totient function $J_k(n)$, and unitary totient function $\varphi^*(n)$ modulo $m$, are non-periodic for certain modulo $m$. In addition, we extend a result of Ayad and Kihel \cite{r1} on the non-periodicity of certain arithmetic function $g(n)$. On the other hand, we construct several transcendental numbers arising from the continued fractions attached with $\tau(n)$, $E_k(z)$, $\Phi(n)$, $g(n)$, $\varphi(n)$, $\sigma(n)$, $\sigma*\varphi(n)$, $J_k(n)$, and $\varphi^*(n)$.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Problem for Non-Linearizable Third-Order ODEs with Four-Dimensional Lie Symmetry Subalgebras under Point Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartan's equivalence method is applied to explicitly construct invariant coframes for four branches, which are used to characterize all non-linearizable third-order ODEs with a four-dimensional Lie symmetry subalgebra under point transformations. Additionally, we present a method for constructing the point transformations based on the derived invariant coframes. Examples are provided to illustrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-type inequality for fractional BVPs involving two Hadamard fractional derivatives of different orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a Lyapunov-type inequality for a class of fractional boundary value problems (BVPs) involving two Hadamard fractional derivatives of different orders with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The method is based on the construction of the corresponding Green's function and establishing its maximum value through rigorous analytical techniques. The obtained inequality provides the necessary conditions for the existence of nontrivial solutions to the proposed problem. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our results by establishing nonexistence criteria for nontrivial solutions to certain problems, providing examples.</description>

      <title>Fourier Series Generated by Additive Prime Factor Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous arithmetic--spectral construction associating planar geometric objects with additive prime factor statistics. Let $\mathrm{sopfr}(n)$ denote the sum of prime factors of $n$, counted with multiplicity, and define the summatory function $B(x) = \sum_{n \le x} \mathrm{sopfr}(n)$. It is known that $B(x) \sim \frac{\pi^2 x^2}{12 \log x}$ as $x \to \infty$. We show that $B(n)$ admits an exact prime-indexed decomposition $B(n) = \sum_{p \le n} p\, v_p(n!)$, where $v_p(n!)$ denotes the $p$-adic valuation of $n!$. This identity motivates the definition of a sparse prime-indexed Fourier series $F_n(t) = \sum_{p \le n} v_p(n!) e^{i p t}$, which we investigate from analytic and geometric perspectives. We establish precise norm identities, relate the construction to circulant Hermitian polygon transformations whose eigenpolygons are discrete Fourier modes, and examine the planar geometry arising from sampled curves. All geometric observations are explicitly experimental. The results provide a rigorous arithmetic foundation for prime-related Fourier geometry and motivate further theoretical and experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Thinned Wallis-type prime products in residue classes modulo $2^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For odd primes $p$ we consider the factors \[ A(p)=\frac{p-\chi_4(p)}{p+\chi_4(p)}, \qquad \chi_4(p)= \begin{cases} 1,&amp;p\equiv 1\pmod 4, \\ -1,&amp;p\equiv 3\pmod 4, \end{cases} \] and study products of $A(p)$ restricted to unions of residue classes modulo $2^m$. We give a simple criterion for the existence of a finite nonzero limit, prove a logarithmic asymptotic in the general case, and express the limiting constant in terms of Mertens-type constants in arithmetic progressions (hence in terms of Dirichlet $L$-values).</description>

      <title>Multiplication Operators on the Lipschitz Space of an Infinite Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lipschitz space of an infinite (locally-finite) graph is defined as the set of functions on the vertices of the graph such that the differences of the values between adjacent vertices remain bounded. In this paper we prove that this set is a Banach space when endowed with its natural norm, and we define the little Lipschitz space as the subspace where these differences tend to zero. We consider the multiplication operators on these spaces and characterize their boundedness, compactness and the spectra. We also obtain estimates of the norm and essential norm, and we characterize when these operators are isometric.</description>

      <title>On The Complex Zeros of The Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.04058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a summary of the general approach outlined in my previous papers toward proving the riemann hypothesis. Numerical and graphical proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is presented with analytical arguments although more work needs strengthened and general supplementary proof to make the arguments more analytically rigorous for a full proof. I present a unified approach to the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) by combining IBP, multivariable calculus, Lyapunov stability, and functional-analytic operator methods. Using the integral representation of {\zeta}(s), I develop a sequence of kernels via infinite integration by parts, constructing an operator on a Hilbert space. An associated energy functional measures the stability of this operator, revealing that boundedness occurs only on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. Complementing this spectral approach, I analyze {\zeta}(s) as a multivariable surface, showing that zeros correspond to stable equilibria trapped between extrema of the symmetric {\xi}-function. The combined framework provides a rigorous roadmap, linking the integral representation, sign-swapping criteria, extrema constraints, Lyapunov stability, and spectral analysis to the location of all nontrivial zeros of {\zeta}(s). I also state lemma and research which if proven fit well into this apparatus to give us a full proof of the riemann hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Evaluation of Arctanh Power Sums via Infinite Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish closed-form expressions for the infinite series sum from n=2 to infinity of arctanh(n^-k) for all integers k &gt;= 2 by connecting these sums to infinite product formulas involving the gamma function. Our approach uses logarithmic manipulations, the Fubini-Tonelli theorem, and Frullani's integral theorem. As applications, we derive a structural identity relating the Riemann zeta function zeta(k) to these sums, establish a new series representation for the Euler-Mascheroni constant gamma, and show that this representation admits an exponentially convergent reformulation via zeta values. We further prove that h(k) = sum from n=2 to infinity of arctanh(n^-k) is strictly decreasing and strictly convex in k, and we establish explicit two-sided bounds and asymptotic expansions. The decimal expansions of the closed-form values and several auxiliary sequences arising from these identities are cataloged in the OEIS.</description>
