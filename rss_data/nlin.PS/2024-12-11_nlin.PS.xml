      <title>Periodic solutions for a pair of delay-coupled excitable theta neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a pair of identical theta neurons in the excitable regime, each coupled to the other via a delayed Dirac delta function with the same delay. This simple network can support different periodic solutions, and we concentrate on two important types: those for which the neurons are perfectly synchronous, and those where the neurons are exactly half a period out of phase and fire alternatingly. Owing to the specific type of pulsatile feedback, we are able to determine these solutions and their stability analytically. More specifically, (infinitely many) branches of periodic solutions of either type are created at saddle-node bifurcations, and they gain stability at symmetry-breaking bifurcations when their period as a function of delay is at its minimum. We also determine the respective branches of symmetry-broken periodic solutions and show that they are all unstable. We demonstrate by considering smoothed pulse-like coupling that the special case of the Dirac delta function can be seen as a sort of normal form: the basic structure of the different periodic solutions of the two theta neurons is preserved, but there may be additional changes of stability along the different branches.</description>

      <title>Families of Discrete Breathers on a Nonlinear Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique geometry of the two-dimensional tripartite Kagome lattice is responsible for shaping diverse families of spatially localized and time-periodic nonlinear modes known as discrete breathers. We state conditions for the existence of breathers and compute their spatiotemporal profiles near the edges of the linear phonon spectrum. Our findings include the existence of strongly nonlinear and dynamically stable breathers inside the band gap, asymptotic expressions for small-amplitude breather norms, and the construction of breather families with compact support on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Manipulating topological charges via engineering zeros of wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands in quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the topological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave excitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical analysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well manipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons and their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a change in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with the direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases. Possibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for current experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions. These results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials using quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature exciton-polariton-driven self-phase modulation in planar perovskite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical nonlinearities are crucial for advanced photonic technologies since they allow photons to be managed by photons. Exciton-polaritons resulting from strong light-matter coupling are hybrid in nature: they combine small mass and high coherence of photons with strong nonlinearity enabled by excitons, making them ideal for ultrafast all-optical manipulations. Among the most prospective polaritonic materials are halide perovskites since they require neither cryogenic temperatures nor expensive fabrication techniques. Here we study strikingly nonlinear self-action of ultrashort polaritonic pulses propagating in planar MAPbBr$_3$ perovskite slab waveguides. Tuning input pulse energy and central frequency, we experimentally observe various scenarios of its nonlinear evolution in the spectral domain, which include peak shifts, narrowing, or splitting driven by self-phase modulation, group velocity dispersion, and self-steepening. The theoretical model provides complementary temporal traces of pulse propagation and reveals the transition from the birth of a doublet of optical solitons to the formation of a shock wave, both supported by the system. Our results represent an important step in ultrafast nonlinear on-chip polaritonics in perovskite-based systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of pattern stabilization in a driven superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of patterns in driven systems has been studied extensively, and their emergence can be connected to a fine balance of instabilities and stabilization mechanisms. While the early phase of pattern formation can be understood on the basis of linear stability analyses, the long-time dynamics can only be described by accounting for the interactions between the excitations generated by the drive. Here, we observe the stabilization of square patterns in an interaction-driven, two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. These patterns emerge due to inherent high-order processes that become relevant in the regime of large phonon occupations. Theoretically, this can be understood as the emergence of a stable fixed point of coupled nonlinear amplitude equations, which include phonon-phonon interactions. We experimentally probe the predicted flows towards such a stable fixed-point, as well as repulsion from a saddle fixed-point, using the experimental control unique to quantum gases.</description>
