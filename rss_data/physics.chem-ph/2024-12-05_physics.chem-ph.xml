      <title>Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Fast and flexible range-separated models for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most atomistic machine learning (ML) models rely on a locality ansatz, and decompose the energy into a sum of short-ranged, atom-centered contributions. This leads to clear limitations when trying to describe problems that are dominated by long-range physical effects - most notably electrostatics. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but efforts to make them efficient and widely available are hampered by the need to incorporate an ad hoc implementation of methods to treat long-range interactions. We develop a framework aiming to bring some of the established algorithms to evaluate non-bonded interactions - including Ewald summation, classical particle-mesh Ewald (PME), and particle-particle/particle-mesh (P3M) Ewald - into atomistic ML. We provide a reference implementation for PyTorch as well as an experimental one for JAX. Beyond Coulomb and more general long-range potentials, we introduce purified descriptors which disregard the immediate neighborhood of each atom, and are more suitable for general long-ranged ML applications. Our implementations are fast, feature-rich, and modular: They provide an accurate evaluation of physical long-range forces that can be used in the construction of (semi)empirical baseline potentials; they exploit the availability of automatic differentiation to seamlessly combine long-range models with conventional, local ML schemes; and they are sufficiently flexible to implement more complex architectures that use physical interactions as building blocks. We benchmark and demonstrate our torch-pme and jax-pme libraries to perform molecular dynamics simulations, to train range-separated ML potentials, and to evaluate long-range equivariant descriptors of atomic structures.</description>

      <title>Wavepacket and Reduced-Density Approaches for High-Dimensional Quantum Dynamics: Application to the Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Asymmetrical Light-Harvesting Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitation-energy transfer (EET) and relaxation in an optically excited building block of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) dendrimers are simulated using wavepackets with the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method and reduced-density matrices with the hierachical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. The dynamics of the ultrafast electronic funneling between the first two excited electronic states in the asymmetrically meta-substituted PPE oligomer with two rings on one branch and three rings on the other side, with a shared ring in between, is treated with 93-dimensional ab initio vibronic-coupling Hamiltonian (VCH) models, either linear or with bilinear and quadratic terms. The linear VCH model is also used to model an open quantum system. The linear-response absorption and emission spectra are simulated with both the ML-MCTDH and HEOM methods. The latter is further used to explore the nonlinear response regime and the expected EET fingerprint in the time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectra and excited stimulated emission (ESE) with delta-like impulsive laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>String-like Rearrangements Induce Mobility in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical heterogeneity is a signature phenomenon of deeply supercooled liquids and glasses. Here, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations between local relaxation events that underpin it are the result of local relaxation events raising the likelihood that other relaxation events subsequently occur nearby, confirming a widely held, but until now unsubstantiated, belief that dynamical facilitation is responsible for dynamical heterogeneity. We find that mobility is propagated through the entrainment of particles into elementary string-like rearrangements, known as microstrings, and not through perturbing the structure surrounding these rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of metalloborophene nanoribbons on Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metalloborophene, characterized by the presence of metal-centered boron wheels denoted as M\c{opyright}Bn, has garnered considerable attention in recent years due to its versatile properties and potential applications in fields such as electronics, spintronics, and catalysis. However, the experimental verification of metalloborophene has been challenging, mainly due to the unconventional two-dimensional (2D) boron networks. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and first-principles calculations to unveil Cu\c{opyright}B8 metalloborophene nanoribbons formed via spontaneous alloying after the deposition of boron on a heated Cu(110) substrate under ultrahigh vacuum condition. The thermodynamically preferred precursor, the anchoring of boron network to metal atoms, and anisotropic lattice mismatch are identified as pivotal factors in the formation of these metalloborophene nanoribbons. This discovery expands the repertoire of 2D materials and offers a potential pathway for the synthesis of other metalloborophenes.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the failure of equipartition for the p-V behavior of liquid water and the hydration free energy components of a small protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earlier we showed that in the molecular dynamics simulation of a rigid model of water it is necessary to use an integration time-step $\delta t \leq 0.5$ fs to ensure equipartition between translational and rotational modes. Here we extend that study in the $NVT$ ensemble to $NpT$ conditions and to an aqueous protein. We study neat liquid water with the rigid, SPC/E model and the protein BBA (PDB ID: 1FME) solvated in the rigid, TIP3P model. We examine integration time-steps ranging from $0.5$ fs to $4.0$ fs for various thermostat plus barostat combinations. We find that a small $\delta t$ is necessary to ensure consistent prediction of the simulation volume. Hydrogen mass repartitioning alleviates the problem somewhat, but is ineffective for the typical time-step used with this approach. The compressibility, a measure of volume fluctuations, and the dielectric constant, a measure of dipole moment fluctuations, are also seen to be sensitive to $\delta t$. Using the mean volume estimated from the $NpT$ simulation, we examine the electrostatic and van der Waals contribution to the hydration free energy of the protein in the $NVT$ ensemble. These contributions are also sensitive to $\delta t$. In going from $\delta t = 2$ fs to $\delta t = 0.5$ fs, the change in the net electrostatic plus van der Waals contribution to the hydration of BBA is already in excess of the folding free energy reported for this protein.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Critical Micelle Concentration of Nonionic and Ionic Surfactants by Self-Consistent Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and understanding its relationship with both the intrinsic molecular structures and environmental conditions are crucial for the rational design of surfactants. Here, we develop a self-consistent field theory which unifies the study of CMC, micellar structure and kinetic pathway of micellization in one framework. The long-range electrostatic interactions are accurately treated, which not only makes the theory applicable to both nonionic and ionic surfactants but also enables us to capture a variety of salt effects. The effectiveness and versatility of the theory is verified by applying it to three types of commonly used surfactants. For polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (C$_m$E$_n$) surfactants, we predict a wide span of CMC from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$M as the composition parameters $m$ and $n$ are adjusted. For the ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant, we show the decrease of CMC as salt concentration increases, and capture both the specific cation effect and the specific anion effect. Furthermore, for sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) surfactants, we find a non-monotonic dependence of both the CMC and micelle size on the number of oxyethylene groups. Our theoretical predictions of CMC are in quantitative agreement with experimental data reported in literature for all the three types of surfactants.</description>

      <title>Scalable learning of potentials to predict time-dependent Hartree-Fock dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to learn the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) inter-electronic potential of a molecule from its electron density dynamics. Though the entire TDHF Hamiltonian, including the inter-electronic potential, can be computed from first principles, we use this problem as a testbed to develop strategies that can be applied to learn a priori unknown terms that arise in other methods/approaches to quantum dynamics, e.g., emerging problems such as learning exchange-correlation potentials for time-dependent density functional theory. We develop, train, and test three models of the TDHF inter-electronic potential, each parameterized by a four-index tensor of size up to $60 \times 60 \times 60 \times 60$. Two of the models preserve Hermitian symmetry, while one model preserves an eight-fold permutation symmetry that implies Hermitian symmetry. Across seven different molecular systems, we find that accounting for the deeper eight-fold symmetry leads to the best-performing model across three metrics: training efficiency, test set predictive power, and direct comparison of true and learned inter-electronic potentials. All three models, when trained on ensembles of field-free trajectories, generate accurate electron dynamics predictions even in a field-on regime that lies outside the training set. To enable our models to scale to large molecular systems, we derive expressions for Jacobian-vector products that enable iterative, matrix-free training.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of Charge Densities in Electronic Structure Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate charge densities are essential for reliable electronic structure calculations because they significantly impact predictions of various chemical properties and in particular, according to the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, atomic forces. This study examines the accuracy of charge densities obtained from different DFT exchange-correlation functionals in comparison with coupled cluster calculations with single and double excitations. We find that modern DFT functionals can provide highly accurate charge densities, particularly in case of meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. In connection with Gaussian basis sets, it is necessary to use the largest basis sets available to obtain densitites that are nearly basis set error free. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate computational methods for generating high-precision charge densities, which are for instance needed to generate reference data for training modern machine learned potentials.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system with unreduced dynamics governed by invertible propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.</description>

      <title>Explainable Data-driven Modeling of Adsorption Energy in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of machine learning (ML) in catalysis has spurred interest in leveraging these techniques to enhance catalyst design. Our study aims to bridge the gap between physics-based studies and data-driven methodologies by integrating ML techniques with eXplainable AI (XAI). Specifically, we employ two XAI techniques: Post-hoc XAI analysis and Symbolic Regression. These techniques help us unravel the correlation between adsorption energy and the properties of the adsorbate-catalyst system. Leveraging a large dataset such as the Open Catalyst Dataset (OC20), we employ a combination of shallow ML techniques and XAI methodologies. Our investigation involves utilizing multiple shallow machine learning techniques to predict adsorption energy, followed by post-hoc analysis for feature importance, inter-feature correlations, and the influence of various feature values on the prediction of adsorption energy. The post-hoc analysis reveals that adsorbate properties exert a greater influence than catalyst properties in our dataset. The top five features based on higher Shapley values are adsorbate electronegativity, the number of adsorbate atoms, catalyst electronegativity, effective coordination number, and the sum of atomic numbers of the adsorbate molecule. There is a positive correlation between catalyst and adsorbate electronegativity with the prediction of adsorption energy. Additionally, symbolic regression yields results consistent with SHAP analysis. It deduces a mathematical relationship indicating that the square of the catalyst electronegativity is directly proportional to the adsorption energy. These consistent correlations resemble those derived from physics-based equations in previous research. Our work establishes a robust framework that integrates ML techniques with XAI, leveraging large datasets like OC20 to enhance catalyst design through model explainability.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>
