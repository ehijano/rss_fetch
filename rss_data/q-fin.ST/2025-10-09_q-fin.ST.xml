      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Self- and Cross-Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an offline nonparametric estimator for concave multi-asset propagator models based on a dataset of correlated price trajectories and metaorders. Compared to parametric models, our framework avoids parameter explosion in the multi-asset case and yields confidence bounds for the estimator. We implement the estimator using both proprietary metaorder data from Capital Fund Management (CFM) and publicly available S&amp;P order flow data, where we augment the former dataset using a metaorder proxy. In particular, we provide unbiased evidence that self-impact is concave and exhibits a shifted power-law decay, and show that the metaorder proxy stabilizes the calibration. Moreover, we find that introducing cross-impact provides a significant gain in explanatory power, with concave specifications outperforming linear ones, suggesting that the square-root law extends to cross-impact. We also measure asymmetric cross-impact between assets driven by relative liquidity differences. Finally, we demonstrate that a shape-constrained projection of the nonparametric kernel not only ensures interpretability but also slightly outperforms established parametric models in terms of predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Factor-Augmented Models for Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasts are vital in modern finance for risk management, portfolio allocation, and strategic decision-making. However, existing methods face key limitations. Fully multivariate models, while comprehensive, are computationally infeasible for realistic portfolios. Factor models, though efficient, primarily use static factor loadings, failing to capture evolving volatility co-movements when they are most critical. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, model-agnostic Factor-Augmented Volatility Forecast framework. Our approach employs a time-varying factor model to extract a compact set of dynamic, cross-sectional factors from realized volatilities with minimal computational cost. These factors are then integrated into both statistical and AI-based forecasting models, enabling a unified system that jointly models asset-specific dynamics and evolving market-wide co-movements. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across two prominent asset classes-large-cap U.S. technology equities and major cryptocurrencies-over both short-term (1-day) and medium-term (7-day) horizons. Using a suite of linear and non-linear AI-driven models, we consistently observe substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and economic value. Notably, a practical pairs-trading strategy built on our forecasts delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and profitability, particularly under adverse market conditions.</description>
