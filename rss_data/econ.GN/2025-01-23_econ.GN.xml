      <title>Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.</description>

      <title>Exploring the heterogeneous impacts of Indonesia's conditional cash transfer scheme (PKH) on maternal health care utilisation using instrumental causal forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses instrumental causal forests, a novel machine learning method, to explore the treatment effect heterogeneity of Indonesia's conditional cash transfer scheme on maternal health care utilisation. Using randomised programme assignment as an instrument for enrollment in the scheme, we estimate conditional local average treatment effects for four key outcomes: good assisted delivery, delivery in a health care facility, pre-natal visits, and post-natal visits. We find significant treatment effect heterogeneity by supply-side characteristics, even though supply-side readiness was taken into account during programme development. Mothers in areas with more doctors, nurses, and delivery assistants were more likely to benefit from the programme, in terms of increased rates of good assisted delivery outcome. We also find large differences in benefits according to indicators of household poverty and survey wave, reflecting the possible impact of changes in programme design in its later years. The impact on post-natal visits in 2013 displayed the largest heterogeneity among all outcomes, with some women less likely to attend post-natal check ups after receiving the cash transfer in the long term.</description>
