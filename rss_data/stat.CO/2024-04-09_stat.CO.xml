      <title>Quantum Fault Trees and Minimal Cut Sets Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault Trees represent an essential tool in the reliability and risk assessment of engineering systems. By decomposing the structure of the system into Boolean function, Fault Trees allow the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the system. One of the main important tasks in Fault Tree analysis is the identification of Minimal Cut Sets, defined as groups of components that present the least path of resistance toward a system's failure. Identifying them allows reliability engineers to enhance the reliability and safety of the system, making system failures less likely to occur. However, the minimal cut set identification problem is challenging to solve, due to the exponential growth experienced in the number of feasible configurations as the system's size grows linearly. Over the last few years, quantum computation has been heralded as a promising tool to tackle computational challenges of increased complexity. The reason for this is the promising prospects that the use of quantum effects has for challenging computational tasks. However, its application into Probabilistic Risk Assessment and reliability engineering, and in particular to challenges related to the Fault Tree model, is still uncharted territory. To fill this gap, the objective of the paper is to integrate quantum computation into the Fault Tree Model and present an assessment of their capabilities for the minimal cut set identification problem. To this end, this paper proposes a novel algorithm to encode a fault tree into a quantum computer and to perform the identification of minimal cut sets with increased efficiency via the application of the Quantum Amplitude Amplification protocol. For validation purposes, a series of theoretical and numerical results, the latter obtained using a quantum simulator, are presented in which the proposed algorithm is compared against traditional approaches, such as Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <title>fastcpd: Fast Change Point Detection in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Change point analysis is concerned with detecting and locating structure breaks in the underlying model of a sequence of observations ordered by time, space or other variables. A widely adopted approach for change point analysis is to minimize an objective function with a penalty term on the number of change points. This framework includes several well-established procedures, such as the penalized log-likelihood using the (modified) Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or the minimum description length (MDL). The resulting optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time by dynamic programming or its improved version, such as the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm (Killick, Fearnhead, and Eckley 2012). However, existing computational methods often suffer from two primary limitations: (1) methods based on direct implementation of dynamic programming or PELT are often time-consuming for long data sequences due to repeated computation of the cost value over different segments of the data sequence; (2) state-of-the-art R packages do not provide enough flexibility for users to handle different change point settings and models. In this work, we present the fastcpd package, aiming to provide an efficient and versatile framework for change point detection in several commonly encountered settings. The core of our algorithm is built upon PELT and the sequential gradient descent method recently proposed by Zhang and Dawn (2023). We illustrate the usage of the fastcpd package through several examples, including mean/variance changes in a (multivariate) Gaussian sequence, parameter changes in regression models, structural breaks in ARMA/GARCH/VAR models, and changes in user-specified models.</description>

      <title>Statistical Estimation of Mean Lorentzian Line Width in Spectra by Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a statistical approach for estimating the mean line width in spectra comprising Lorentzian, Gaussian, or Voigt line shapes. Our approach uses Gaussian processes in two stages to jointly model a spectrum and its Fourier transform. We generate statistical samples for the mean line width by drawing realizations for the Fourier transform and its derivative using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In addition to being fully automated, our method enables well-calibrated uncertainty quantification of the mean line width estimate through Bayesian inference. We validate our method using a simulation study and apply it to an experimental Raman spectrum of $\beta$-carotene.</description>
