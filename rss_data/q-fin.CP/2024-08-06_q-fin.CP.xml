      <title>Neural Term Structure of Additive Process for Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The additive process generalizes the L\'evy process by relaxing its assumption of time-homogeneous increments and hence covers a larger family of stochastic processes. Recent research in option pricing shows that modeling the underlying log price with an additive process has advantages in easier construction of the risk-neural measure, an explicit option pricing formula and characteristic function, and more flexibility to fit the implied volatility surface. Still, the challenge of calibrating an additive model arises from its time-dependent parameterization, for which one has to prescribe parametric functions for the term structure. For this, we propose the neural term structure model to utilize feedforward neural networks to represent the term structure, which alleviates the difficulty of designing parametric functions and thus attenuates the misspecification risk. Numerical studies with S\&amp;P 500 option data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the neural term structure.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of the SABR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient and reliable simulation scheme for the stochastic-alpha-beta-rho (SABR) model. The two challenges of the SABR simulation lie in sampling (i) the integrated variance conditional on terminal volatility and (ii) the terminal price conditional on terminal volatility and integrated variance. For the first sampling procedure, we analytically derive the first four moments of the conditional average variance, and sample it from the moment-matched shifted lognormal approximation. For the second sampling procedure, we approximate the conditional terminal price as a constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) distribution. Our CEV approximation preserves the martingale condition and precludes arbitrage, which is a key advantage over Islah's approximation used in most SABR simulation schemes in the literature. Then, we adopt the exact sampling method of the CEV distribution based on the shifted-Poisson-mixture Gamma random variable. Our enhanced procedures avoid the tedious Laplace inversion algorithm for sampling integrated variance and non-efficient inverse transform sampling of the forward price in some of the earlier simulation schemes. Numerical results demonstrate our simulation scheme to be highly efficient, accurate, and reliable.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral Approach for Time-Dependent Hamiltonians with Applications to Derivatives Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a semi-classical path integral approach originally introduced by Giachetti and Tognetti [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 912 (1985)] and Feynman and Kleinert [Phys. Rev. A 34, 5080 (1986)] to time-dependent Hamiltonians, thus extending the scope of the method to the pricing of financial derivatives. We illustrate the accuracy of the approach by presenting results for the well-known, but analytically intractable, Black-Karasinski model for the dynamics of interest rates. The accuracy and computational efficiency of this path integral approach makes it a viable alternative to fully-numerical schemes for a variety of applications in derivatives pricing.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions to the Guyon-Lekeufack path-dependent volatility model with general kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of a continuous solution to a path-dependent volatility model introduced by Guyon and Lekeufack (2023) to model the price of an equity index and its spot volatility. The considered model for the trend and activity features can be written as a Stochastic Volterra Equation (SVE) with non-convolutional and non-bounded kernels as well as non-Lipschitz coefficients. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the SVE under integrability and regularity assumptions on the two kernels and under a condition on the second kernel weighting the past squared returns which ensures that the activity feature is bounded from below by a positive constant. Then, assuming in addition that the kernel weighting the past returns is of exponential type and that an inequality relating the logarithmic derivatives of the two kernels with respect to their second variables is satisfied, we show the positivity of the volatility process which is obtained as a non-linear function of the SVE's solution. We show numerically that the choice of an exponential kernel for the kernel weighting the past returns has little impact on the quality of model calibration compared to other choices and the inequality involving the logarithmic derivatives is satisfied by the calibrated kernels. These results extend those of Nutz and Valdevenito (2023).</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach to Reveal Algorithmic Unfairness in Credit Approval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework, "peer-induced fairness", to scientifically audit algorithmic fairness. It addresses a critical but often overlooked issue: distinguishing between adverse outcomes due to algorithmic discrimination and those resulting from individuals' insufficient capabilities. By utilizing counterfactual fairness and advanced causal inference techniques, such as the Single World Intervention Graph, this model-agnostic approach evaluates fairness at the individual level through peer comparisons and hypothesis testing. It also tackles challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, offering a flexible, plug-and-play self-audit tool for stakeholders and an external audit tool for regulators, while providing explainable feedback for those affected by unfavorable decisions.</description>

      <title>A Note on Optimal Liquidation with Linear Price Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we consider the maximization of the expected terminal wealth for the setup of quadratic transaction costs. First, we provide a very simple probabilistic solution to the problem. Although the problem was largely studied, as far as we know up to date this simple and probabilistic form of the solution has not appeared in the literature.
  Next, we apply the general result for the numerical study of the case where the risky asset is given by a fractional Brownian Motion and the information flow of the investor can be diversified.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Stock Return Prediction Using Newsflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their fine-tuning techniques have demonstrated superior performance in various language understanding and generation tasks. This paper explores fine-tuning LLMs for stock return forecasting with financial newsflow. In quantitative investing, return forecasting is fundamental for subsequent tasks like stock picking, portfolio optimization, etc. We formulate the model to include text representation and forecasting modules. We propose to compare the encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs, considering they generate text representations in distinct ways. The impact of these different representations on forecasting performance remains an open question. Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs' token-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on real news and investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations from LLMs' token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that enhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the relatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model leads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no consistent winners. Among the three LLMs studied (DeBERTa, Mistral, Llama), Mistral performs more robustly across different universes; (3) return predictions derived from LLMs' text representations are a strong signal for portfolio construction, outperforming conventional sentiment scores.</description>
