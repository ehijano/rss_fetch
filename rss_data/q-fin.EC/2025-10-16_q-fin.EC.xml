      <title>A theory-based AI automation exposure index: Applying Moravec's Paradox to the US labor market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory-driven automation exposure index based on Moravec's Paradox. Scoring 19,000 O*NET tasks on performance variance, tacit knowledge, data abundance, and algorithmic gaps reveals that management, STEM, and sciences occupations show the highest exposure. In contrast, maintenance, agriculture, and construction show the lowest. The positive relationship between wages and exposure challenges the notion of skill-biased technological change if AI substitutes for workers. At the same time, tacit knowledge exhibits a positive relationship with wages consistent with seniority-biased technological change. This index identifies fundamental automatability rather than current capabilities, while also validating the AI annotation method pioneered by Eloundou et al. (2024) with a correlation of 0.72. The non-positive relationship with pre-LLM indices suggests a paradigm shift in automation patterns.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Variance of Market Portfolio and of Entire Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the unified market-based description of returns and variances of the trades with shares of a particular security, of the trades with shares of all securities in the market, and of the trades with the market portfolio. We consider the investor who doesn't trade the shares of his portfolio he collected at time t0 in the past. The investor observes the time series of the current trades with all securities made in the market during the averaging interval. The investor may convert these time series into the time series that model the trades with all securities as the trades with a single security and into the time series that model the trades with the market portfolio as the trades with a single security. That establishes the same description of the returns and variances of the trades with a single security, the trades with all securities in the market, and the market portfolio. We show that the market-based variance, which accounts for the impact of random change of the volumes of consecutive trades with securities, takes the form of Markowitz's (1952) portfolio variance if the volumes of consecutive trades with all market securities are assumed constant. That highlights that Markowitz's (1952) variance ignores the effects of random volumes of consecutive trades. We compare the market-based variances of the market portfolio and of the trades with all market securities, consider the importance of the duration of the averaging interval, and explain the economic obstacles that limit the accuracy of the predictions of the returns and variances at best by Gaussian distributions. The same methods describe the returns and variances of any portfolio and the trades with its securities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Subsidy Targeting in the Health Insurance Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act reached an all-time high of approximately 25 million Americans in 2025, roughly doubling since enhanced premium tax credit subsidies were made available in 2021. The scheduled expiration of enhanced subsidies in 2026 is estimated to leave over seven million Americans without health insurance coverage. Ten states have created supplemental Marketplace subsidies, yet little attention has been paid to how to best structure these subsidies to maximize coverage. Using administrative enrollment data from Maryland's Marketplace, we estimate demand for Marketplace coverage. Then, using estimated parameters and varying budget constraints, we simulate how to optimally allocate supplemental state premium subsidies to mitigate coverage losses from enhanced premium subsidy expiration. We find that premium sensitivity is greatest among enrollees with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, where the marginal effect of an additional ten dollars in monthly subsidies on the probability of coverage is approximately 6.5 percentage points, and decreases to roughly 2.5 percentage points above 200 percent FPL. Simulation results indicate that each 10 million dollars in annual state subsidies could retain roughly 5,000 enrollees, though the cost-effectiveness of these subsidies falls considerably once all enrollees below 200 percent of the federal poverty level are fully subsidized. We conclude that states are well positioned to mitigate, but not stop, coverage losses from expanded premium tax credit subsidy expiration.</description>

      <title>What is the general Welfare? Welfare Economic Perspectives on Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers do not know what the framers of the United States Constitution intended when they wrote of the general Welfare. Nevertheless, economists can conjecture by specifying social welfare functions that aim to express the preferences of the population. Economists have often simplified analysis of public policy by assuming that individuals have homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered preferences. In reality, individuals may hold heterogeneous private and distributional preferences. To enhance policy analysis, economists should specify social welfare functions that express the richness and variety of actual personal preferences. The possibilities are vast. I focus on preferences for equity. There has been much controversy regarding interpretation of equity, a term that public discourse has used in vague and conflicting ways. Specifying social welfare functions that formally express different interpretations of equity will not eliminate disagreements, but it should clarify concepts and reduce the inconsistencies that afflict verbal communication.</description>

      <title>AI Realtor: Towards Grounded Persuasive Language Generation for Automated Copywriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16810v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) for grounded persuasive language generation in automated copywriting, with real estate marketing as a focal application. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted copywriting while ensuring factuality of content generation.</description>

      <title>The value of storage in electricity distribution: The role of markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electricity distribution companies deploy battery storage to defer grid upgrades by reducing peak demand. In deregulated jurisdictions, such storage often sits idle because regulatory constraints bar participation in electricity markets. Here, we develop an optimization framework that, to our knowledge, provides the first formal model of market participation constraints within storage investment and operation planning. Applying the framework to a Massachusetts case study, we find that market participation could deliver similar savings as peak demand reduction. Under current conditions, market participation does not increase storage investment, but at very low storage costs, could incentivize deployment beyond local distribution needs. This might run contrary to the separation of distribution from generation in deregulated markets. Our framework can identify investment levels appropriate for local distribution needs.</description>
