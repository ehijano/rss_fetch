      <title>Field-induced magnon decays in dipolar quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous disintegration of magnons in two-dimensional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets dominated by long-range dipolar interactions. Analyzing kinematic constraints, we show that the unusual dispersion of dipolar ferromagnets in a uniform magnetic field precludes magnon-decay at all fields, in sharp contrast to short-range exchange-driven magnets. However, in a staggered magnetic field, used for state preparation in recent Rydberg array experiments, magnons can decay in both dipolar ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Remarkably, such decays do not require a minimum threshold field, and happen over a nearly fixed fraction of the Brillouin Zone in the XY limit, highlighting the significant role played by dipolar interactions. In addition, topological transitions in the decay surfaces lead to singularities in the magnon spectrum. Regularizing such singular behavior via a self-consistent approach, we make predictions for dynamical spin correlations accessible to near-term quantum simulators and sensors.</description>

      <title>Orbital antiferromagnetic currents in a frustrated fermionic ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spinless $t$-$t'$ ionic Hubbard chain at 1/2 filling and large hopping ratio $t'/t$. In this limit the model adequately maps onto a weakly coupled triangular ladder with a potential interchain bias. The low-energy properties of the system are formed due to the interplay of geometrical frustration, correlations and charge imbalance. We derive the effective field-theoretical model to study universal properties of the model in the scaling limit. We show that at full dynamical frustration the ground state of the ladder represents a repulsive version of the Luther-Emery liquid with dominant orbital antiferromagnetic correlations exhibiting the slowest power-law decay in the ground state. Pairing correlations also display algebraic order but are subdominant. At an incomplete dynamical frustration a finite commensurability gap is dynamically generated, and the fluctuating OAF transforms to a long-range ordered state with a spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry. The mass gap in the spectrum of relative density fluctuations gets suppressed upon increasing the potential bias.</description>

      <title>Magnon Confinement on the Two-Dimensional Penrose Lattice: Perpendicular-Space Analysis of the Dynamic Structure Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the spin-wave formalism within and beyond the harmonic-oscillator approximation, we study the dynamic structure factors of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ nearest-neighbor quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets on two-dimensional quasiperiodic lattices with particular emphasis on a magnetic analog to the well-known confined states of a hopping Hamiltonian for independent electrons on a two-dimensional Penrose lattice. We present comprehensive calculations on the $\mathbf{C}_{5\mathrm{v}}$ Penrose tiling in comparison with the $\mathbf{C}_{8\mathrm{v}}$ Ammann-Beenker tiling, revealing their decagonal and octagonal antiferromagnetic microstructures. Their dynamic spin structure factors both exhibit linear soft modes emergent at magnetic Bragg wavevectors and have nearly or fairly flat scattering bands, signifying magnetic excitations localized in some way, at several different energies in a self-similar manner. In particular, the lowest-lying highly flat mode is distinctive of the Penrose lattice, which is mediated by its unique antiferromagnons confined within tricoordinated sites only, unlike their itinerant electron counterparts involving pentacoordinated as well as tricoordinated sites. Bringing harmonic antiferromagnons into higher-order quantum interaction splits the lowest-lying nearly flat scattering band in two, each mediated by further confined antiferromagnons, which is fully demonstrated and throughly visualized in the perpendicular as well as real spaces. We disclose superconfined antiferromagnons on the two-dimensional Penrose lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantum Critical Scaling in Quasi-One-Dimensional YbFe$_5$P$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the low temperature magnetization $M$ and specific heat $C$ as a function of temperature and magnetic field of the quasi-one-dimensional spin chain, heavy fermion compound YbFe$_5$P$_3$, which resides close to a quantum critical point. The results are compared to the predictions of scaling laws obtained from a generalized free energy function expected near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (AFQCP). The scaling behavior depends on the dimensionality $d$ of the fluctuations, the coherence length exponent $\nu$, and the dynamic exponent $z$. The free energy treats the magnetic field as a relevant renormalization group variable, which leads to a new exponent $\phi=\nu z_h$, where $z_h$ is a dynamic exponent expected in the presence of a magnetic field. When $z_h=z$, $T/H$ scaling is expected, as observed in several compounds close to a QCP; whereas in YbFe$_5$P$_3$, a $T/H^{3/4}$ dependence of the scaling is observed. This dependence reflects the relationship $z_h=(4z/3)$ and a field exponent $\phi =4/3$. A feature of the scaling law is that it restricts the possible values of the exponents to two cases for YbFe$_5$P$_3$: $d$=1, $\nu$=1, $z$=1, and $d$=2, $\nu$=1/2, $z$=2.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomenons when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>Ambipolar doping of a charge-transfer insulator in the Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the similarities and differences between adding or removing electrons from a charge-transfer insulator may provide insights about the origin of the electron-hole asymmetry found in cuprates. Here we study with cellular dynamical mean-field theory the Emery model set in the charge-transfer insulator regime, and dope it with either electrons or holes. We consider the normal state only and focus on the doping evolution of the orbital character of the dopants and on the nature of the doping driven transition. Regarding the orbital character of the dopants, we found an electron-hole asymmetry: doped electrons mostly enter the copper orbitals, whereas doped holes mostly enter the oxygen orbitals. Regarding the nature of the doping driven transition, we found no qualitative electron-hole asymmetry: upon either electron or hole doping, there is a two-stage transition from a charge-transfer insulator to a strongly correlated pseudogap and then to a metal. This shows that a strongly correlated pseudogap is an emergent feature of doped correlated insulators in two dimensions, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments on ambipolar Sr$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ cuprate films. Our results indicate that merely doping with holes or electrons a charge-transfer insulator is not sufficient for explaining the electron-hole asymmetry observed in the normal state phase diagram of cuprates. Our work reinforces the view that actual hole-doped cuprates are more correlated than their electron-doped counterparts.</description>

      <title>Crystal-symmetry-paired spin-valley locking in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical efforts predicted a type of unconventional antiferromagnet characterized by the crystal symmetry C (rotation or mirror), which connects antiferromagnet sublattices in real space and simultaneously couples spin and momentum in reciprocal space. This results in a unique C-paired spin-valley locking (SVL) and corresponding novel properties such as piezomagnetism and noncollinear spin current even without spin-orbit coupling. However, the unconventional antiferromagnets reported thus far are not layered materials, limiting their potential in spintronic applications. Additionally, they do not meet the necessary symmetry requirements for nonrelativistic spin current. Here, we report the realization of C-paired SVL in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnetic compound, Rb1-{\delta}V2Te2O. Spin resolved photoemission measurements directly demonstrate the opposite spin splitting between C-paired valleys. Quasi-particle interference patterns reveal the suppression of inter-valley scattering due to the spin selection rules, as a direct consequence of C-paired SVL. All these experiments are well consistent with the results obtained from first-principles calculations. Our observations represent the first realization of layered antiferromagnets with C-paired SVL, enabling both the advantages of layered materials and possible control through crystal symmetry manipulation. These results hold significant promise and broad implications for advancements in magnetism, electronics, and information technology.</description>

      <title>A pair of small Fermi surfaces, chiral charge-density-wave quantum criticality, and BEC-type finite-momentum pairing instabilities in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SC near CDW quantum criticality in materials with small Fermi surfaces suggests a novel mechanism of SC such as PDW SC and BEC beyond the conventional BCS mechanism of SC. Recent research by Kim $\textit{et al}$. [arXiv:2312.11979] proposes how chiral CDW ordering arises in TiSe$_2$, characterized by a pair of small Fermi surfaces. Interaction-driven electronic quantum fluctuations described by a polarization bubble between the pair of small Fermi surfaces give rise to UV symmetry forbidden but dynamically generated linear electron-lattice couplings at IR, resulting in a chiral symmetry breaking without chiral instability in either the charge or the lattice sector. This mechanism has been substantiated through Raman spectroscopy, inelastic x-ray scattering, group theory, and many-body calculations in the random phase approximation. The emergence of SC in this material, induced by pressure or doping, particularly, combined with the pair of small Fermi surfaces and the possible chiral CDW quantum criticality, indicates that conventional interpretations on thermodynamics and magnetic responses based on the BCS theory may not be sufficient. In this study, we propose that BEC-type SC appears, driven by chiral CDW quantum critical fluctuations, which provides a robust explanatory framework for this phenomenon. As an inevitable consequence, we demonstrate that electrons in the $p$ and $d$ orbitals form interorbital Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, reminiscent of FFLO or PDW state. Employing a group theoretical and tight-binding approach to the interorbital pairing, we find that the possibility of unconventional pairing symmetries is restricted, except for the orbital-selective $s$-wave pairing symmetry. These findings suggest that a distinct superconducting mechanism, behaving conventionally, may operate in materials exhibiting exotic CDW with small Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Closing of the Mott gap near step edges in NiS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prototypical charge-transfer type Mott insulator NiS2 pyrite exhibits a metal-insulator transition with bandwidth control. Recent discoveries on surface-specific electronic states on other 3d transition-metal disulfide pyrites motivate us to further investigate the surface of NiS2, where metallic surface conduction is discussed. Here, the spectroscopic-imaging scanning-tunneling-microscopy observations revealed that the surface is not metallic, contrary to the expectation. Instead, the Mott gap is closed near step edges, suggesting possible electrical conduction from one-dimensional channels. The edge anomaly was observed irrespective of its magnetic order and is limited to the insulator phases.</description>

      <title>Giant anisotropic magnetoresistance in few-layer {\alpha}-RuCl3 tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit assisted Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3 is proximate to the coveted quantum spin liquid (QSL) predicted by the Kitaev model. In the search for the pure Kitaev QSL, reducing the dimensionality of this frustrated magnet by exfoliation has been proposed as a way to enhance magnetic fluctuations and Kitaev interactions. Here, we perform angle-dependent tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) measurements on ultrathin $\alpha$-RuCl3 crystals with various layer numbers to probe their magnetic, electronic and crystal structure. We observe a giant change in resistance - as large as ~2500% - when the magnetic field rotates either within or out of the $\alpha$-RuCl3 plane, a manifestation of the strongly anisotropic spin interactions in this material. In combination with scanning transmission electron microscopy, this tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) reveals that few-layer $\alpha$-RuCl3 crystals remain in the high-temperature monoclinic phase at low temperature. It also shows the presence of a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below the critical temperature TN ~ 14 K, which is twice the one typically observed in bulk samples with rhombohedral stacking. Our work offers valuable insights into the relation between the stacking order and magnetic properties of this material, which helps lay the groundwork for creating and electrically probing exotic magnetic phases like QSLs via van der Waals engineering.</description>

      <title>Learning eigenstates of quantum many-body Hamiltonians within the symmetric subspaces using neural network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of neural network quantum states has become widespread in the search for ground states in complex quantum many-body systems. However, achieving high precision remains challenging due to the intricate sign structures and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. In this work, we propose a neural network state method that is confined to a significantly smaller symmetric subspace, by the full space summation and Markov chain Metropolis sampling approaches. Using symmetries and group theory, the proposed method significantly reduces the number of parameters in neural network states and achieves better accuracy and convergence properties. We validate our method using the frustrated spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain and compare its performance against NetKet, the standard library of neural network states. The results indicate that our symmetrized neural network states achieve a substantial improvement over the conventional neural network states method, reducing energy errors by two orders of magnitude. We also compare degenerate eigenstates with different quantum numbers, highlighting the advantage of operating within a smaller variational space.</description>

      <title>Gapped quantum spin liquid in a triangular-lattice Ising-type antiferromagnet PrMgAl11O19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search of quantum spin liquid (QSLs), spin-1/2 triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets (TLHAFs) have always been viewed as fertile soils. Despite the true magnetically-ordered ground state, anisotropy has been considered to play a significant role in stabilizing a QSL state. However, the nature and ground state of the most anisotropic case, the triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet (TLIAF), remains elusive and controversial. Here, we report specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements on a newly-discovered Ising-type QSL candidate PrMgAl11O19. At zero field, the magnetic specific heat shows a quadratic temperature dependence. On the contrary, no direct positive magnetic contribution to thermal conductivity was detected, ruling out the presence of mobile gapless fermionic excitations. Further analysis of phonon thermal conductivity reveals that the phonons are strongly scattered by thermally-activated magnetic excitations out of a gap, which exhibits a linear dependence with magnetic field. These results demonstrate that the spin-1/2 TLIAF PrMgAl11O19 has a gapped Z2 QSL ground state.</description>

      <title>Topological Kondo semimetals emulated in hetero-bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moir\'{e} structure of AB-stacked $\rm{MoTe_2/WSe_2}$ represents a natural platform to realize Kondo lattice models, due to the discrepancy of the bandwidth between the individual layers. Here, we study this system at the commensurate filling of $\nu_{\rm tot}=2$. Our focus is on the $1+1$ filling setting of $\nu_{\rm Mo} =\nu_{\rm W}=1$, which enables a Kondo lattice description. We find a Kondo semimetal due to the sizable intra-orbital hopping among the electrons in the $\rm{MoTe_2}$ layer. The Kondo-driven (emergent) flat band is naturally pinned to the Fermi energy. When combined with the inherent topology of the electronic structure, a topological Kondo semimetal phase ensues. We calculate the valley Hall response and, due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, also identify a spontaneous Hall effect. There is a Berry curvature dodecapole, which leads to a fourth-order spontaneous Hall effect in the perturbative regime of the electric field that is further amplified in the non-perturbative regime. As such, the system provides a tunable setting to simulate topological Kondo semimetals. Finally, we discuss the pathways that connect the physics realized here to the Weyl Kondo semimetals and their proximate phases that have been advanced in recent years in topological Kondo lattice models and materials.</description>

Abstract: Immersing a mobile impurity in a quantum many-body environment can reveal fundamental properties of the background medium, hence providing a powerful probe of quantum matter. This approach is particularly intriguing when considering media with exotic properties, such as strongly-correlated phases and topological states of matter. In this work, we study the dressing of a mobile impurity interacting with a chiral mode, as provided by the edge of topological quantum matter. The resulting ''chiral polaron'' is characterized by an asymmetric spectral function, which reflects the chirality and group velocity of the topological edge mode and the drag experienced by the mobile impurity. We first build our theoretical understanding from an effective one-dimensional chiral model, which captures the hallmark signatures of the chiral polaron. We then demonstrate how this simple picture extends to realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulator states, by adapting tensor-network methods to polaron spectroscopy. Injecting mobile impurities on the edge of topological quantum matter is shown to be a powerful tool to probe exotic edge properties, particularly suitable for cold-atom experiments.</description>

Abstract: Twisted trilayer graphene hosts two moir\'e superlattices originating from two interfaces between graphene layers. However, the system is generally unstable to lattice relaxation at small twist angles and is expected to show a significantly modified electronic band structure. In particular, a helical trilayer graphene - whose two twisted angles have the same sign - provides an attractive platform with a flat band isolated by large energy gaps near the magic angle, but the interplay between the lattice and the electronic degrees of freedom is not well understood. Here, we performed a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation to study the lattice relaxation of helical trilayer graphenes and evaluated their electronic spectra with a tight-binding model calculation. The comparison of the electronic spectra both with and without the lattice relaxation reveals how the lattice relaxation significantly modifies the electronic spectra particularly near the charge neutrality point. We also investigated the local density of states to visualize the spatially-varying electronic spectra that accords with domain patterns of moir\'e lattice stackings. We propose these characteristic spectral features in the electronic degrees of freedom of a relaxed helical trilayer graphene to be confirmed by scanning probe techniques, such as scanning single-electron transistors and scanning tunneling microscopes.</description>

      <title>Molecular Orbital Electronic Instability in the van der Waals Kagome Semiconductor Nb$_3$Cl$_8$: Exploring Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a cluster Mott insulator with a distinctive magnetic molecular orbital structure organized into a breathing kagome lattice, showcases critical phase transitions under specialized conditions. By transitioning from paramagnetic to nonmagnetic states below 90 K, we clarified this behavior through combined nuclear magnetic resonance and low-temperature X-ray diffraction studies, pointing to charge disproportionation as the driving force. Subsequent investigations via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations have disclosed topologically flat bands, confirming advanced electronic characteristics in Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. These discoveries not only deepen our comprehension of Mott insulators but also broaden our grasp of the dynamic interrelations among topology, electron interactions, and quantum phenomena in two-dimensional systems. The research on Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ thus lays foundational knowledge for advancing the exploration of quantum states in complex material systems, marking it as a critical model in the ongoing evolution of condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: We present the ab initio supported discovery of two new Pu based intermetallic compounds, PuNiSn and PuPtSn. Using density functional theory, the formation energies within the relevant ternary phase diagrams were calculated to predict the stability of both compounds. Simultaneously, Pu-Ni-Sn and Pu-Pt-Sn materials were arc-melted and subsequently characterized with magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity measurements from 2-300 K. Magnetization measurements show that PuNiSn and PuPtSn order antiferromagnetically at TN = 11 K and TN = 15 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements show an enhanced residual electronic specific heat that is indicative of strong electron correlations. Resistivity measurements are indicative of Kondo behavior for PuNiSn while crystal field effects may play a role in the observed temperature dependence for PuPtSn.</description>

      <title>Collective optical properties of moir\'e excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Molecular Crystals and Superlattices on Triangular Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using atomistic simulations, we show that new types of skyrmion states called skyrmion molecular crystals and skyrmion superlattices can be realized on triangular substrates when there are two or three skyrmions per substrate minimum. We find that as a function of the magnetic field and substrate periodicity, a remarkably wide variety of ordered phases appear similar to those found in colloidal or Wigner molecular crystals, including ferromagnetic and herringbone states. The ability of the skyrmions to annihilate, deform, and change size gives rise to a variety of superlattice states in which a mixture of different skyrmion sizes and shapes produces bipartate or more complex lattice structures. Our results are relevant for skyrmions on structured triangular substrates, in magnetic arrays, or skyrmions in moire materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the excitation spectrum of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ chain with antiferromagnetic Ising anisotropy across a magnetic quantum phase transition induced by the application of a site-dependent transverse magnetic field. Motivated by the chain antiferromagnet BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, we consider a situation where the transverse magnetic field has a strong uniform component and a weaker staggered part. To determine the nature of the excitations giving rise to the spin dynamical structure factor, we use a combination of analytical approaches and the numerically exact time-dependent matrix product state method. We identify below the quantum phase transition high-energy many-body two-magnon and three-magnon repulsively bound states which are clearly visible due to the staggered component of the magnetic field. At high magnetic fields and low temperature, single magnons dominate the dynamics. Our theory results are in very good agreement with terahertz spectroscopy experimental results presented in [Wang et al., Nature 631, 760 (2024)].</description>

Abstract: We present the mean-field phase diagram of electrons in a kagome flat band with repulsive interactions. In addition to flat-band ferromagnetism, the Hartree-Fock analysis yields cascades of unconventional magnetic orders driven by onsite repulsion as filling changes. These include a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-charge stripe orders, as well as an evolution from $120^\circ$AFM to intriguing noncoplanar spin orders with tetrahedral structures. We also map out the phase diagram under extended repulsion at half and empty fillings of the flat band. To examine the possibilities beyond the mean-field level, we conduct a projective symmetry group analysis and identify the feasible $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquids and the magnetic orders derivable from them. The theoretical phase diagrams are compared with recent experiments on FeSn and FeGe, enabling a determination of the most likely magnetic instabilities in these and similar flat-band kagome materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the invertible and non-invertible symmetries of topological finite group gauge theories in general spacetime dimensions, where the gauge group can be Abelian or non-Abelian. We focus in particular on the 0-form symmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified by boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We investigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other topological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped boundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples, including non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic duality symmetry in non-Abelian finite group gauge theories. In particular, we discover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d gauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the Cheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge groups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Kitaev model on the $\{9,3\}$ hyperbolic lattice. The $\{9,3\}$ is formed by a regular 3-coordinated tiling of nonagons, where the 3-color coding of bonds according to the inequivalent Kitaev Ising spin couplings yields the natural generalization of the original Kitaev model for Euclidean regular honeycomb tiling. Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for large finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. Due to its non-commutative translation group structure, such type of hyperbolic spin liquid is conjectured to feature chiral quasiparticles with a potentially non-Abelian Bloch profile.</description>

      <title>Duality between open systems and closed bilayer systems, and thermofield double states as quantum many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a duality between open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation and satisfying the detailed balance condition on the one side, and closed bilayer systems with a self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the other side. Under this duality, the identity operator on the open system side maps to the thermofield double state which turns out to be a quantum many-body scar of the dual Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$. A remarkable feature of this thermofield scar is a tunable entanglement entropy controlled by the reservoir temperature on the open system side. Further, we identify broad classes of many-body open systems with nontrivial explicit eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperator. The expectation values of the corresponding observables exhibit a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Under the above duality, these eigen operators give rise to additional (towers of) scars. Finally, we point out that more general superoperators (not necessarily of the GKSL form) can be mapped to self-adjoint Hamiltonians of bilayer systems harbouring scars, and provide an example thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range entangled states are vital for quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Preparing such states by combining measurements with unitary gates opened new possibilities for efficient protocols with finite-depth quantum circuits. The complexity of these algorithms is crucial for the resource requirements on a large-scale noisy quantum device, while their stability to perturbations decides the fate of their implementation. In this work, we consider stochastic quantum circuits in one and two dimensions comprising randomly applied unitary gates and local measurements. These operations preserve a class of discrete local symmetries, which are broken due to the stochasticity arising from timing and gate imperfections. In the absence of randomness, the protocol generates a symmetry-protected long-range entangled state in a finite-depth circuit. In the general case, by studying the time evolution under this hybrid circuit, we analyze the time to reach the target entangled state. We find two important time scales that we associate with the emergence of certain symmetry generators. The quantum trajectories embody the local symmetry with a time scaling logarithmically with system size, while global symmetries require exponentially long times. We devise error-mitigation protocols that significantly lower both time scales and investigate the stability of the algorithm to perturbations that naturally arise in experiments. We also generalize the protocol to realize toric code and Xu-Moore states in two dimensions, opening avenues for future studies of anyonic excitations. Our results unveil a fundamental relationship between symmetries and dynamics across a range of lattice geometries, which contributes to a broad understanding of the stability of preparation algorithms in terms of phase transitions. Our work paves the way for efficient error correction for quantum state preparation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of Single-Particle States Decaying into a Continuum due to Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how topological Chern numbers can be defined when single-particle states hybridize with continua. We do so exemplarily in a bosonic Haldane model at zero temperature with an additional on-site decay of one boson into two and the conjugate fusion of two bosons into one. Restricting the Hilbert space to two bosons at maximum, the exact self-energy is accessible. We use the bilinear Hamiltonian $H_0$ corrected by the self-energy $\Sigma$ to compute Chern numbers by two different approaches. The results are gauged against a full many-body calculation in the Hilbert space where possible. We establish numerically and analytically that the effective Hamiltonian $H_\text{eff}=H_0(\vec k) +\Sigma(\omega,\vec k)$ reproduces the correct many-body topology if the considered band does not overlap with the continuum. In case of overlaps, one can extend the definition of the Chern number to the non-Hermitian $H_\text{eff}$ and there is evidence that the Chern number changes at exceptional points. But the bulk-boundary correspondence appears to be no longer valid and edge modes delocalize.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

Abstract: The quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. So far, the transduction efficiency $\eta$ via the magneto-optic Faraday effect (i.e., the light-magnon interaction) in the ferromagnet YIG has been demonstrated to be small as $\eta\sim 10^{-8} \mathrm{-} 10^{-15}$ due to the weak magneto-optic coupling. Here, we take advantage of the fact that three-dimensional topological insulator thin films exhibit a topological Faraday effect that is independent of the sample thickness in the terahertz regime. This leads to a large Faraday rotation angle and therefore enhanced light-magnon interaction in the thin film limit. We show theoretically that the transduction efficiency between microwave and terahertz photons can be greatly improved to $\eta\sim10^{-4}$ by utilizing the heterostructures consisting of topological insulator thin films such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and ferromagnetic insulator thin films such as YIG.</description>

      <title>Polarization evolution equation for the exchange-strictionally formed II-type multiferroic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiferroics are the materials, where single cell of a magnetically order crystal forms an electric dipole moment. We derive equation for the evolution of the macroscopic density of the electric dipole moment (polarization of the system). The derivation is made within the "quantum hydrodynamic" method, which allows to derive equations for the evolution of the macroscopic functions of the quantum systems starting with the microscopic description. In this work we do not consider the microscopic level of individual electrons and ions, but we start our analysis from the combination of ions in cells of the crystal. We present an effective Hamiltonian for the evolution of such intermediate scale objects. We also apply the equation for the electric dipole moment of the single cell, which is recontracted in the corresponding operator. Using this operator and the wave function of combination of ions in the cell, we define the macroscopic density of the electric dipole moment. Finally, we apply the nonstationary Schrodinger equation with the chosen Hamiltonian in order to derive equation evolution of the polarization. The derivation is made for the dipole formed by the exchange-striction mechanism in the II-type multiferroic materials. The interaction caused term in the polarization evolution equation is found to be proportional to the fourth space derivative of mixed product (triple scalar product) of three spin density vectors. Conditions are discussed for the regime, where interaction appears in a smaller order on the space derivatives.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong coupling polarons in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bose polaron is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between impurities and Bogoliubov excitation in Bose-Einstein condensates, analogous to the polaron formed by electrons and phonons in solid-state physics. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phase separation on weakly coupled and strongly coupled Bose polarons. Our findings reveal that phase separation induces a remarkable alteration in the properties of weakly coupled Bose polarons. However, in the case of strong coupling, phase separation cannot destroy the highly self-trapping state of Bose polarons.</description>

      <title>Field transformations in functional integral, effective action and functional flow equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field transformations for the quantum effective action lead to different pictures of a given physical situation, as describing a given evolution of the universe by different geometries. Field transformations for functional flow equations can reveal important physical features, as the appearance of bound states. They also allow for technical simplifications. We make a critical assessment of the virtues and shortcomings of different versions of field transformations. Key issues are demonstrated by the quantum field theory for scalars with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term. Our findings confirm the principle of field relativity for gravity and cosmology based on the quantum effective action.</description>

      <title>Absence of local conserved quantity in the Heisenberg model with next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that the Heisenberg chain with next-nearest-neighbor interaction, which is anticipated to be non-integrable, is indeed non-integrable in the sense that this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity. Our result covers two important models, the Majundhar-Ghosh model and the Shastry-Sutherland model, as special cases. These models are shown to be non-integrable while have some solvable energy eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved U(1) charge, whose basic degrees of freedom are canonical bosons. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- the first microscopic model that realizes the near-CFT$_1$ dynamics -- is based on random $p$-local interactions among fermions. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Our construction is based on a recent insight that near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. All such models are essentially solved by chord diagrams regardless of the nature of the underlying degrees of freedom. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from. We also show the level statistics of both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energies.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport and current noise through a multilevel Anderson impurity: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections in quantum dots and magnetic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$ discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature $T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1 \lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$ dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Signature of Orbital Driven Finite Momentum Pairing in a 3D Ising Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite momentum superconducting pairing states (FMPs), where Cooper pairs carry non-zero momentum, are believed to give rise to exotic physical phenomena including the pseudogap phase of cuprate high-Tc superconductors and Majorana fermions in topological superconductivity. FMPs can emerge in intertwined electronic liquids with strong spin-spin interactions or be induced by lifting the spin degeneracy under magnetic field as originally proposed by Fulde-Ferrell and Larkin-Ovchinnikov. In quantum materials with strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, such as the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the spin degree of freedom is frozen enabling novel orbital driven FMPs via magnetoelectric effect. While evidence of orbital driven FMPs has been revealed in bilayer TMDs, its realization in 3D bulk materials remains an unresolved challenge. Here we report experimental signatures of FMP in a locally noncentrosymmetric bulk superconductor 4Hb-TaS2. Using hard X-ray diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal unusual 2D chiral charge density wave (CDW) and weak interlayer hopping in 4Hb-TaS2. Below the superconducting transition temperature, the upper critical field, Hc2, linearly increases via decreasing temperature, and well exceeds the Pauli limit, thus establishing the dominant orbital pair-breaking mechanism. Remarkably, we discover a field-induced superconductivity-to-superconductivity transition that breaks continuous rotational symmetry of the s-wave uniform pairing in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory down to the six-fold rotation symmetry. Combining with a Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis that incorporates magnetoelectric effect, our observations provide strong evidence of orbital driven FMP in the 3D quantum heterostructure 4Hb-TaS2.</description>
