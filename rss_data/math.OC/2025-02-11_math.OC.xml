      <title>Transportation Network Analysis, Volume I: Static and Dynamic Traffic Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book covers static and dynamic traffic assignment models used in transportation planning and network analysis. Traffic assignment is the final step in the traditional planning process, and recent decades have seen many advances in formulating and solving such models. The book discusses classical solution methods alongside recent ones used in contemporary planning software.
  The primary audience for the book is graduate students new to transportation network analysis, and to this end there are appendices providing general mathematical background, and more specific background in formulating optimization problems. We have also included appendices discussing more general optimization applications outside of traffic assignment. We believe the book is also of interest to practitioners seeking to understand recent advances in network analysis, and to researchers wanting a unified reference for traffic assignment content.
  A second volume is currently under preparation, and will cover transit, freight, and logistics models in transportation networks. A free PDF version of the text will always be available online at https://sboyles.github.io/blubook.html. We will periodically post updated versions of the text at this link, along with slides and other instructor resources.</description>

      <title>Loss Functions for Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the first-order loss function, the complementary loss function and the second-order loss function for several probability distributions. These loss functions are important functions in inventory optimization and other quantitative fields. For several reasons, which will become apparent throughout this paper, the implementation of these loss functions prefers the use of an analytic expression, only using standard probability functions. However, complete and consistent references of analytic expressions for these loss functions are lacking in literature. This paper aims to close this gap and can serve as a reference for researchers, software engineers and practitioners that are concerned with the optimization of a quantitative system. This should lead directly to easily using different probability distributions in quantitive models which is at the core of optimization. Also, this paper serves as a broad introduction to loss functions and their use in inventory control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial focuses on kriging-based simulation optimization, emphasizing the importance of data efficiency in optimization problems involving expensive simulation models. It discusses how kriging models contribute to developing algorithms that minimize the number of required simulations, particularly in the presence of noisy evaluations. The tutorial compares the performance of kriging-based algorithms against traditional polynomial-based optimization methods using an illustrative example. Additionally, it discusses key extensions of kriging-based algorithms, including multi-objective and constrained optimization, providing insights into their application in complex, real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Blackout DIFUSCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of Blackout Diffusion into the DIFUSCO framework for combinatorial optimization, specifically targeting the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Inspired by the success of discrete-time diffusion models (D3PM) in maintaining structural integrity, we extend the paradigm to a continuous-time framework, leveraging the unique properties of Blackout Diffusion. Continuous-time modeling introduces smoother transitions and refined control, hypothesizing enhanced solution quality over traditional discrete methods. We propose three key improvements to enhance the diffusion process. First, we transition from a discrete-time-based model to a continuous-time framework, providing a more refined and flexible formulation. Second, we refine the observation time scheduling to ensure a smooth and linear transformation throughout the diffusion process, allowing for a more natural progression of states. Finally, building upon the second improvement, we further enhance the reverse process by introducing finer time slices in regions that are particularly challenging for the model, thereby improving accuracy and stability in the reconstruction phase. Although the experimental results did not exceed the baseline performance, they demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in balancing simplicity and complexity, offering new insights into diffusion-based combinatorial optimization. This work represents the first application of Blackout Diffusion to combinatorial optimization, providing a foundation for further advancements in this domain. * The code is available for review at https://github.com/Giventicket/BlackoutDIFUSCO.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Quantum and Classical Computing in Large-Scale Dynamic Portfolio Optimization Under Market Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to transform the financial industry, yet its advantages over traditional methods have not been evidenced. As this technology rapidly evolves, benchmarking is essential to fairly evaluate and compare different computational strategies. This study presents a challenging yet solvable problem of large-scale dynamic portfolio optimization under realistic market conditions with frictions. We frame this issue as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, compatible with digital computing and ready for quantum computing, to establish a reliable benchmark. By applying the latest solvers to real data, we release benchmarks that help verify true advancements in dynamic trading strategies, either quantum or digital computing, ensuring that reported improvements in portfolio optimization are based on robust, transparent, and comparable metrics.</description>

      <title>Iterative Schemes for Uniformly Nonconvex Equilibrium Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniformly regular equilibrium problems are natural generalizations of abstract equilibrium prob lems and they are defined over the uniformly prox-regular nonconvex sets. Some new efficient
  implicit methods for solving uniformly regular equilibrium problems are analyzed by the aux iliary principle and inertial proximal methods. The convergence analysis of the new proposed
  methods is considered under some mild conditions. Gap functions are constructed to suggest
  some descent-type scheme for uniformly regular equilibrium problems. Our results can be viewed
  as significant refinements and improvements of the previously known results and they continue
  to hold for equilibrium problems, variational inequalities and complementarity problems as well.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fr\'echet Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is a key measure of central tendency as a barycenter for a given set of points in a general metric space. It is computed by solving an optimization problem and is a fundamental quantity in statistics. In this paper, we study Fr\'echet means in tropical geometry -- a piecewise linear, combinatorial, and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry that has gained prominence in applications. A key property of Fr\'echet means is that uniqueness is generally not guaranteed, which is true in tropical settings. In solving the tropical Fr\'echet mean optimization problem, we obtain a geometric characterization of the collection of all Fr\'echet means in a general tropical space as a tropically and classically convex polytope. Furthermore, we prove that a certificate of positivity for finitely many quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ always exists, given that their quadratic homogeneous components are sums of squares. We propose an algorithm to symbolically compute the Fr\'echet mean polytope based on our exact quadratic optimization result and study its complexity.</description>

      <title>Contextual Scenario Generation for Two-Stage Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programs (2SPs) are important tools for making decisions under uncertainty. Decision-makers use contextual information to generate a set of scenarios to represent the true conditional distribution. However, the number of scenarios required is a barrier to implementing 2SPs, motivating the problem of generating a small set of surrogate scenarios that yield high-quality decisions when they represent uncertainty. Current scenario generation approaches do not leverage contextual information or do not address computational concerns. In response, we propose contextual scenario generation (CSG) to learn a mapping between the context and a set of surrogate scenarios of user-specified size. First, we propose a distributional approach that learns the mapping by minimizing a distributional distance between the predicted surrogate scenarios and the true contextual distribution. Second, we propose a task-based approach that aims to produce surrogate scenarios that yield high-quality decisions. The task-based approach uses neural architectures to approximate the downstream objective and leverages the approximation to search for the mapping. The proposed approaches apply to various problem structures and loosely only require efficient solving of the associated subproblems and 2SPs defined on the reduced scenario sets. Numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods are presented.</description>

      <title>Properties of Turnpike Functions for Discounted Finite MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with finite sets of states and actions. Value iteration is one of the major methods for finding optimal policies. For each discount factor, starting from a finite number of iterations, which is called the turnpike integer, value iteration algorithms always generate decision rules, which are deterministic optimal policies for the infinite-horizon problems. This fact justifies the rolling horizon approach for computing infinite-horizon optimal policies by conducting a finite number of value iterations. This paper describes properties of turnpike integers and provides their upper bounds.</description>

      <title>A scaling characterization of nc-rank via unbounded gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a tuple of $n \times n$ complex matrices ${\cal A} = (A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_m)$, the linear symbolic matrix $A = A_1x_1 + A_2x_2 + \cdots + A_m x_m$ is nonsingular in the noncommutative sense if and only if the completely positive operators $T_{\cal A} (X) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i X A_i^{\dagger}$ and $T_{\cal A}^*(X) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i^{\dagger} X A_i$ can be scaled to be doubly stochastic: For every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ there are $g,h \in GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ such that $\|T_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I)- I\| &lt; \epsilon$, $\| T^*_{g^\dagger{\cal A}h}(I) - I\| &lt; \epsilon$. In this paper, we show a refinement: The noncommutative corank of $A$ is equal to one-half of the minimum residual $\|T_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I) - I\|_1 + \|T^*_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I) - I\|_1$ over all possible scalings $g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h$, where $\|\cdot \|_1$ is the trace norm. To show this, we interpret the residuals as gradients of a convex function on symmetric space $GL(n,\mathbb{C})/U_n$, and establish a general duality relation of the minimum gradient-norm of a lower-unbounded convex function $f$ on $GL(n,\mathbb{C})/U_n$ with an invariant Finsler metric, by utilizing the unbounded gradient flow of $f$ at infinity.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Mixed-Integer Control through Lifted Control Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-horizon distributionally robust mixed-integer control (DRMIC) of uncertain linear systems. However, deriving an optimal causal feedback control policy to this DRMIC problem is computationally formidable for most ambiguity sets. To address the computational challenge, we propose a novel distributionally robust lifted control policy (DR-LCP) method to derive a high-quality approximate solution to this DRMIC problem for a rich class of Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity sets, including the Wasserstein ambiguity set and its variants. In theory, we analyze the asymptotic performance and establish a tight non-asymptotic bound of the proposed method. In numerical experiments, the proposed DR-LCP method empirically demonstrates superior performance compared with existing methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic reinsurance design with heterogeneous beliefs under the mean-variance framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic reinsurance design problem under the mean-variance criterion, incorporating heterogeneous beliefs between the insurer and the reinsurer, and introducing an incentive compatibility constraint to address moral hazard. The insurer's surplus process is modeled using the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg risk model, with the option to invest in a risk-free asset. To solve the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system, we apply the partitioned domain optimization technique, transforming the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one determined by several key parameters. The resulting optimal reinsurance contracts are more complex than the standard proportional and excess-of-loss contracts commonly studied in the mean-variance literature with homogeneous beliefs. By further assuming specific forms of belief heterogeneity, we derive the parametric solutions and obtain a clear optimal equilibrium solution. Finally, we compare our results with models where the insurer and reinsurer share identical beliefs or where the incentive compatibility constraint is relaxed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of belief heterogeneity on optimal reinsurance strategies.</description>

      <title>The Difference between the Effectiveness of the Operator Splitting Method Compared to the Implicit Euler in Autonomous and Non-Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of the Operator Splitting Method for specific autonomous and non-autonomous Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) with the Implicit Euler Method. While there are many existing studies on Operator Splitting, few focus on its application to DDEs, particularly in the context of autonomous versus non-autonomous systems. By treating DDEs as either autonomous or non-autonomous Abstract Cauchy Problems and deriving the properties of $C_0$-semigroups (Evolution Families) from their generators, we analyze the effectiveness of the Operator Splitting Method in both types of systems compared to the Implicit Euler Method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Systems Coupled with Solutions of Stochastic Nonsmooth Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study ordinary differential equations (ODE) coupled with solutions of a stochastic nonsmooth convex optimization problem (SNCOP). We use the regularization approach, the sample average approximation and the time-stepping method to construct discrete approximation problems. We show the existence of solutions to the original problem and the discrete problems. Moreover, we show that the optimal solution of the SNCOP with a strong convex objective function admits a linear growth condition and the optimal solution of the regularized SNCOP converges to the least-norm solution of the original SNCOP, which are crucial for us to derive the convergence results of the discrete problems. We illustrate the theoretical results and applications for the estimation of the time-varying parameters in ODE by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Approximations of Controlled Diffusions with Infinite Horizon Discounted and Average Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present discrete-time approximation of optimal control policies for infinite horizon discounted/ergodic control problems for controlled diffusions in $\Rd$\,. In particular, our objective is to show near optimality of optimal policies designed from the approximating discrete-time controlled Markov chain model, for the discounted/ergodic optimal control problems, in the true controlled diffusion model (as the sampling period approaches zero). To this end, we first construct suitable discrete-time controlled Markov chain models for which one can compute optimal policies and optimal values via several methods (such as value iteration, convex analytic method, reinforcement learning etc.). Then using a weak convergence technique, we show that the optimal policy designed for the discrete-time Markov chain model is near-optimal for the controlled diffusion model as the discrete-time model approaches the continuous-time model. This provides a practical approach for finding near-optimal control policies for controlled diffusions. Our conditions complement existing results in the literature, which have been arrived at via either probabilistic or PDE based methods.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Free and Near-Optimal Zeroth-Order Algorithm for Stochastic Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers zeroth-order optimization for stochastic convex minimization problem. We propose a parameter-free stochastic zeroth-order method (POEM) by introducing a step-size scheme based on the distance over finite difference and an adaptive smoothing parameter. We provide the theoretical analysis to show that POEM achieves the near-optimal stochastic zeroth-order oracle complexity. We further conduct the numerical experiments to demonstrate POEM outperforms existing zeroth-order methods in practice.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg-Nash Controllability for Abstract Stochastic Evolution Equations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the concepts of exact, null, and approximate controllability in the Stackelberg-Nash sense for abstract forward and backward stochastic evolution equations, involving two types of controls: leaders and followers. We begin by proving the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium, as well as its characterization for fixed leader controls. We then establish a duality between these controllability concepts and the corresponding observability properties. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to the forward and backward stochastic heat equations. The results for the backward heat equation are obtained by deriving a new Carleman estimate.</description>

      <title>Operator convexity along lines, self-concordance, and sandwiched R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrier methods play a central role in the theory and practice of convex optimization. One of the most general and successful analyses of barrier methods for convex optimization, due to Nesterov and Nemirovskii, relies on the notion of self-concordance. While an extremely powerful concept, proving self-concordance of barrier functions can be very difficult. In this paper we give a simple way to verify that the natural logarithmic barrier of a convex nonlinear constraint is self-concordant via the theory of operator convex functions. Namely, we show that if a convex function is operator convex along any one-dimensional restriction, then the natural logarithmic barrier of its epigraph is self-concordant. We apply this technique to construct self-concordant barriers for the epigraphs of functions arising in quantum information theory. Notably, we apply this to the sandwiched R\'enyi entropy function, for which no self-concordant barrier was known before. Additionally, we utilize our sufficient condition to provide simplified proofs for previously established self-concordance results for the noncommutative perspective of operator convex functions. An implementation of the convex cones considered in this paper is now available in our open source interior-point solver QICS.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of optimal solutions to second-order Beckmann problem through bimartingale couplings and leaf decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely characterise the optimal solutions for the three-marginal optimal transport problem - introduced in [K. Bolbotowski, G. Bouchitt\'e, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theory for the Hessian, 2024, preprint], and whose relaxation is the second-order Beckmann problem - for arbitrary pairs $\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of absolutely continuous measures with common barycentre.
  In our work, we define the concept of bimartingale couplings for a pair of measures and establish several equivalent conditions that ensure such couplings exist. One of these conditions is that the pair is ordered according to the convex-concave order, thereby generalising the classical Strassen theorem. Another equivalent condition is that the dual problem associated with the second-order Beckmann problem attains its optimum at a $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function with isometric derivative.
  We prove that the problem for $\mu,\nu$ completely decomposes into a collection of simpler problems on the leaves of the $1$-Lipschitz derivative $Du$ of an optimal solution $u\in\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the dual problem. On each such, leaf the solution is expressed in terms of bimartingale couplings between conditional measures of $\mu,\nu$, where the conditioning is defined relative to the foliation induced by $Du$.</description>

      <title>Variational integrators for optimal control of foldable drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods that preserves geometric invariants of the system such as energy, momentum and symplectic form, are called geometric integrators. These include variational integrators as an important subclass of geometric integrators. The general idea for those variational integrators is to discretize Hamilton's principle rather than the equations of motion and as a consequence these methods preserves some of the invariants of the original system (symplecticity, symmetry, good behavior of energy,...). In this paper, we construct variational integrators for control-dependent Lagrangian systems on Lie groups. These integrators are derived via a discrete-time variational principle for discrete-time control-dependent reduced Lagrangians. We employ the variational integrator into optimal control problems for path planning of foldable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Simulation are shown to validate the performance of the geometric integrator.</description>

      <title>Topology Optimization considering Shielding and Penetrating Features based on Fictitious Physical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes topology optimization for considering shielding and penetrating features. Based on the fictitious physical model, which is a useful approach to control geometric features, the proposed method analyzes fictitious steady-state temperature fields and interprets target geometric features by examining the temperature change. First, the concept of topology optimization based on the level set method is introduced. Next, the basic idea of the fictitious physical model for considering geometric features is explained. Then, the differences between the shielding and penetrating features are clarified, and the fictitious physical model for evaluating these features is proposed. Furthermore, topology optimization for the minimum mean compliance problem with geometric conditions is formulated. Finally, 2D and 3D numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Optimally Controlled Moving Sets with Geographical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with a family of geometric evolution problems, modeling the spatial control of an invasive population within a region $V\subset \R^2$ bounded by geographical barriers. If no control is applied, the contaminated set $\Omega(t)\subset V$ expands with unit speed in all directions. By implementing a control, a region of area $M$ can be cleared up per unit time.
  Given an initial set $\Omega(0)=\Omega_0\subseteq V$, three main problems are studied: (1) Existence of an admissible strategy $t\mapsto\Omega(t)$ which eradicates the contamination in finite time, so that $\Omega(T)=\emptyset$ for some $T&gt;0$. (2) Optimal strategies that achieve eradication in minimum time. (3) Strategies that minimize the average area of the contaminated set on a given time interval $[0,T]$. For these optimization problems, a sufficient condition for optimality is proved, together with several necessary conditions. Based on these conditions, optimal set-valued motions $t\mapsto \Omega(t)$ are explicitly constructed in a number of cases. \end{abstract}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes provide a survey of recent results and open problems on the boundary control of moving sets. Motivated by the control of an invasive biological species, we consider a class of optimization problems for a moving set $t\mapsto \Omega(t)$, where the goal is to minimize the area of the contaminated set $\Omega(t)$ over time, plus a cost related to the control effort. Here the control function is the inward normal speed, assigned along the boundary $\partial \Omega(t)$. We also consider problems with geographical constraints, where the invasive population is restricted within an island. Existence and structure of eradication strategies, which entirely remove the invasive population in minimum time, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization by Kernel Regression and Density-based Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is highly effective for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, but it faces significant computational challenges due to the high computational complexity of Gaussian processes, which results in a total time complexity that is quartic with respect to the number of iterations. To address this limitation, we propose the Bayesian Optimization by Kernel regression and density-based Exploration (BOKE) algorithm. BOKE uses kernel regression for efficient function approximation, kernel density for exploration, and the improved kernel regression upper confidence bound criteria to guide the optimization process, thus reducing computational costs to quadratic. Our theoretical analysis rigorously establishes the global convergence of BOKE and ensures its robustness. Through extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, we demonstrate that BOKE not only performs competitively compared to Gaussian process-based methods but also exhibits superior computational efficiency. These results highlight BOKE's effectiveness in resource-constrained environments, providing a practical approach for optimization problems in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis for a variant of manifold proximal point algorithm based on Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We incorporate an iteratively reweighted strategy in the manifold proximal point algorithm (ManPPA) in [12] to solve an enhanced sparsity inducing model for identifying sparse yet nonzero vectors in a given subspace. We establish the global convergence of the whole sequence generated by our algorithm by assuming the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) properties of suitable potential functions. We also study how the KL exponents of the different potential functions are related. More importantly, when our enhanced model and algorithm reduce, respectively, to the model and ManPPA with constant stepsize considered in [12], we show that the sequence generated converges linearly as long as the optimal value of the model is positive, and converges finitely when the limit of the sequence lies in a set of weak sharp minima. Our results improve [13, Theorem 2.4], which asserts local quadratic convergence in the presence of weak sharp minima when the constant stepsize is small.</description>

      <title>Optimal regulation in a periodic environment: insights from a simple model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of a simple mathematical model addressing the problem of optimally regulating a process subject to periodic external forcing, which is interesting both in view of its direct applications and as a prototype for more general problems. In this model one must determine an optimal time-periodic `effort' profile, and the natural setting for the problem is in a space of periodic non-negative measures. We prove that there exists a unique solution for the problem in the space of measures, and then turn to characterizing this solution. Under some regularity conditions on the problem's data, we prove that its solution is an absolutely continuous measure, and provide an explicit formula for the measure's density. On the other hand, when the problem's data is discontinuous, the solution measure can also include atomic components. Complementing our analytical results, we carry out numerical computations to obtain solutions of the problem in various instances, which enable us to examine the interesting ways in which the solution's structure varies as the problem's data is varied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a controller for an interconnected system composed of a linear Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) controlled through a linear hetero-directional hyperbolic Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Our objective is to steer the coupled system to a desired final state on average, while keeping the variance-in-time as small as possible, improving robustness to disturbances. By employing backstepping techniques, we decouple the original PDE, reformulating the system as an input delayed SDE with a stochastic drift. We first establish a controllability result, shading light on lower bounds for the variance. This shows that the system can never improve variance below strict structural limits. Under standard controllability conditions, we then design a controller that drives the mean of the states while keeping the variance bounded. Finally, we analyze the optimal control problem of variance minimization along the entire trajectory. Under additional controllability assumptions, we prove that the optimal control can achieve any variance level above the fundamental structural limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we make a survey on the so called randomization method, a recent methodology to study stochastic optimization problems. It allows to represent the value function of an optimal control problem by a suitable backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), by means of an auxiliary optimization problem having the same value as the starting one. This method works for a large class of control problems and provides a BSDE representation to many related PDEs of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type, even in the fully non linear case. After a general informal introduction we explain the method giving full details in a basic case. Then we try to give a complete picture of the existing applications and we present some related open problems.</description>

      <title>EV Fleet Flexibility Estimation and Forecasting for V2X Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting the flexibility potential of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems is important for the future of energy networks, where the integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating and predicting V2X flexibility potential of an EV fleet, based on an aggregate polytope representation, addressing the need for accurate and reliable forecasting methods in the realm of sustainable transportation. The method is robust against individual uncertainties of EV owners behaviours as it is applied at an aggregate level, and the reformulation of the V2X potential as a set of linear constraints allows the proposed method to be integrated into different optimisation problems and therefore be applied for diverse V2X applications. Case studies showcase the capability of the method in capturing the V2X flexibility potential and demonstrate it effectiveness for different V2X applications.</description>

      <title>Joint parameter and state estimation for regularized time-discrete multibody dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for offline parameter estimation of discrete multibody dynamics with regularized and frictional kinematic constraints. This setting leads to unobserved degrees of freedom, which we handle using joint state and parameter estimation. Our method finds the states and parameters as the solution to a nonlinear least squares optimization problem based on the inverse dynamics and the observation error. The solution is found using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with derivatives from automatic differentiation and custom differentiation rules for the complementary conditions that appear due to dry frictional constraints. We reduce the number of method parameters to the choice of the time-step, regularization coefficients, and a parameter that controls the relative weighting of inverse dynamics and observation errors. We evaluate the method using synthetic and real measured data, focusing on performance and sensitivity to method parameters. In particular, we optimize over a 13-dimensional parameter space, including inertial, frictional, tilt, and motor parameters, using data from a real Furuta pendulum. Results show fast convergence, in the order of seconds, and good agreement for different time-series of recorded data over multiple method parameter choices. However, very stiff constraints may cause difficulties in solving the optimization problem. We conclude that our method can be very fast and has method parameters that are robust and easy to set in the tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deferred-Decision Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DDTO--deferred-decision trajectory optimization--a framework for trajectory generation with resilience to unmodeled uncertainties and contingencies. The key idea is to ensure that a collection of candidate targets is reachable for as long as possible while satisfying constraints, which provides time to quantify the uncertainties. We propose optimization-based constrained reachability formulations and construct equivalent cardinality minimization problems, which then inform the design of computationally tractable and efficient solution methods that leverage state-of-the-art convex solvers and sequential convex programming (SCP) algorithms. The goal of establishing the equivalence between constrained reachability and cardinality minimization is to provide theoretically-sound underpinnings for the proposed solution methods. We demonstrate the solution methods on real-world optimal control applications encountered in quadrotor motion planning.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the Product of Two Relaxed Cutters with Relaxation Parameters Beyond Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the product of two relaxed cutters having a common fixed point. We assume that one of the relaxation parameters is greater than two so that the corresponding relaxed cutter is no longer quasi-nonexpansive, but rather demicontractive. We show that if both of the operators are (weakly/linearly) regular, then under certain conditions, the resulting product inherits the same type of regularity. We then apply these results to proving convergence in the weak, norm and linear sense of algorithms that employ such products.</description>

      <title>Rough Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle and an Indirect Shooting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a network of agents that jointly aim to minimise the sum of local functions subject to coupling constraints involving all local variables. To solve this problem, we propose a novel solution based on a primal-dual architecture. The algorithm is derived starting from an alternative definition of the Lagrangian function, and its convergence to the optimal solution is proved using recent advanced results in the theory of time-scale separation in nonlinear systems. The rate of convergence is shown to be linear under standard assumptions on the local cost functions. Interestingly, the algorithm is amenable to a direct implementation to deal with asynchronous communication scenarios that may be corrupted by other non-idealities such as packet loss. We numerically test the validity of our approach on a real-world application related to the provision of ancillary services in three-phase low-voltage microgrids.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Dependent Control Lyapunov Functions for Stabilizing Nonlinear Parameter-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of parameter-dependent (PD) control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for gainscheduled stabilization of nonlinear parameter-varying (NPV) systems under input constraints. It shows that given a PD-CLF, a locally Lipschitz control law can be constructed by solving a robust quadratic program. For polynomial control-affine NPV systems, it provides convex conditions, based on the sum of squares (SOS) programming, to jointly synthesize both a PD-CLF and a PD controller, aimed at maximizing the PD region of stabilization. Input constraints can be straightforwardly incorporated into the synthesis procedure. Unlike traditional linear parameter-varying (LPV) methods that rely on linearization or over-approximation to get an LPV model, the proposed framework fully captures the nonlinearities of the system dynamics. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the method, showcasing its potential for stabilizing NPV systems under input constraints.</description>

      <title>Modelling hydrogen integration in energy system models: Best practices for policy insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of hydrogen in long-term energy strategies requires a broad understanding on how hydrogen is currently modelled in national energy system models. This study provides a review on hydrogen representation within selected energy system models that are tailored towards providing policy insights. The paper adopts a multi-layered review approach and selects eleven notable models for the review. The review covers hydrogen production, storage, transportation, trade, demand, modeling strategies, and hydrogen policies. The review suggests existing models would often opt for a simplified representation that can capture each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This approach allows models to strike a balance between accuracy and preserving computational resources. The paper provides several suggestions for modeling hydrogen in national energy system models.</description>

      <title>Online Covariance Estimation in Nonsmooth Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider applying stochastic approximation (SA) methods to solve nonsmooth variational inclusion problems. Existing studies have shown that the averaged iterates of SA methods exhibit asymptotic normality, with an optimal limiting covariance matrix in the local minimax sense of H\'ajek and Le Cam. However, no methods have been proposed to estimate this covariance matrix in a nonsmooth and potentially non-monotone (nonconvex) setting. In this paper, we study an online batch-means covariance matrix estimator introduced in Zhu et al.(2023). The estimator groups the SA iterates appropriately and computes the sample covariance among batches as an estimate of the limiting covariance. Its construction does not require prior knowledge of the total sample size, and updates can be performed recursively as new data arrives. We establish that, as long as the batch size sequence is properly specified (depending on the stepsize sequence), the estimator achieves a convergence rate of order $O(\sqrt{d}n^{-1/8+\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $d$ and $n$ denote the problem dimensionality and the number of iterations (or samples) used. Although the problem is nonsmooth and potentially non-monotone (nonconvex), our convergence rate matches the best-known rate for covariance estimation methods using only first-order information in smooth and strongly-convex settings. The consistency of this covariance estimator enables asymptotically valid statistical inference, including constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Blocking All Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the general problem of blocking all solutions of some given combinatorial problem with only few elements. For example, the problem of destroying all maximum cliques of a given graph by forbidding only few vertices. Problems of this kind are so fundamental that they have been studied under many different names in many different disjoint research communities already since the 90s. Depending on the context, they have been called the interdiction, most vital vertex, most vital edge, blocker, or vertex deletion problem. Despite their apparent popularity, surprisingly little is known about the computational complexity of interdiction problems in the case where the original problem is already NP-complete. In this paper, we fill that gap of knowledge by showing that a large amount of interdiction problems are even harder than NP-hard. Namely, they are complete for the second stage of Stockmeyer's polynomial hierarchy, the complexity class $\Sigma^p_2$. Such complexity insights are important because they imply that all these problems can not be modelled by a compact integer program (unless the unlikely conjecture NP $= \Sigma_2^p$ holds). Concretely, we prove $\Sigma^p_2$-completeness of the following interdiction problems: satisfiability, 3satisfiability, dominating set, set cover, hitting set, feedback vertex set, feedback arc set, uncapacitated facility location, $p$-center, $p$-median, independent set, clique, subset sum, knapsack, Hamiltonian path/cycle (directed/undirected), TSP, $k$ directed vertex disjoint path ($k \geq 2$), Steiner tree. We show that all of these problems share an abstract property which implies that their interdiction counterpart is $\Sigma_2^p$-complete. Thus, all of these problems are $\Sigma_2^p$-complete \enquote{for the same reason}. Our result extends a recent framework by Gr\"une and Wulf.</description>

      <title>Curse of Dimensionality in Neural Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality in neural network optimization under the mean-field regime is studied. It is demonstrated that when a shallow neural network with a Lipschitz continuous activation function is trained using either empirical or population risk to approximate a target function that is $r$ times continuously differentiable on $[0,1]^d$, the population risk may not decay at a rate faster than $t^{-\frac{4r}{d-2r}}$, where $t$ is an analog of the total number of optimization iterations. This result highlights the presence of the curse of dimensionality in the optimization computation required to achieve a desired accuracy. Instead of analyzing parameter evolution directly, the training dynamics are examined through the evolution of the parameter distribution under the 2-Wasserstein gradient flow. Furthermore, it is established that the curse of dimensionality persists when a locally Lipschitz continuous activation function is employed, where the Lipschitz constant in $[-x,x]$ is bounded by $O(x^\delta)$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$. In this scenario, the population risk is shown to decay at a rate no faster than $t^{-\frac{(4+2\delta)r}{d-2r}}$. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to analyze the impact of function smoothness on the curse of dimensionality in neural network optimization theory.</description>

      <title>DobLIX: A Dual-Objective Learned Index for Log-Structured Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DobLIX, a dual-objective learned index specifically designed for Log-Structured Merge(LSM) tree-based key-value stores. Although traditional learned indexes focus exclusively on optimizing index lookups, they often overlook the impact of data access from storage, resulting in performance bottlenecks. DobLIX addresses this by incorporating a second objective, data access optimization, into the learned index training process. This dual-objective approach ensures that both index lookup efficiency and data access costs are minimized, leading to significant improvements in read performance while maintaining write efficiency in real-world LSM-tree systems. Additionally, DobLIX features a reinforcement learning agent that dynamically tunes the system parameters, allowing it to adapt to varying workloads in real-time. Experimental results using real-world datasets demonstrate that DobLIX reduces indexing overhead and improves throughput by 1.19 to 2.21 times compared to state-of-the-art methods within RocksDB, a widely used LSM-tree-based storage engine.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control with Mixture of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of Gaussian process based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in robotic control, its applicability scope is greatly hindered by multimodal disturbances that are prevalent in real-world settings. Here we propose a novel Mixture of Gaussian Processes based Distributionally Robust MPC (MoGP-DR-MPC) framework for linear time invariant systems subject to potentially multimodal state-dependent disturbances. This framework utilizes MoGP to automatically determine the number of modes from disturbance data. Using the mean and variance information provided by each mode-specific predictive distribution, it constructs a data-driven state-dependent ambiguity set, which allows for flexible and fine-grained disturbance modeling. Based on this ambiguity set, we impose Distributionally Robust Conditional Value-at Risk (DR-CVaR) constraints to effectively achieve distributional robustness against errors in the predictive distributions. To address the computational challenge posed by these constraints in the resulting MPC problem, we equivalently reformulate the DR-CVaR constraints into tractable second-order cone constraints. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed framework. The enhanced control performance of MoGP-DR-MPC is validated through both numerical experiments and simulations on a quadrotor system, demonstrating notable reductions in closed-loop cost by 17% and 4% respectively compared against Gaussian process based MPC.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning of Nonholonomic Cooperative Mobile Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a real-time implementable motion planning technique for cooperative object transportation by nonholonomic mobile manipulator robots (MMRs) in an environment with static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed motion planning technique works in two steps. A novel visibility vertices-based path planning algorithm computes a global piece-wise linear path between the start and the goal location in the presence of static obstacles offline. It defines the static obstacle free space around the path with a set of convex polygons for the online motion planner. We employ a Nonliner Model Predictive Control (NMPC) based online motion planning technique for nonholonomic MMRs that jointly plans for the mobile base and the manipulators arm. It efficiently utilizes the locomotion capability of the mobile base and the manipulation capability of the arm. The motion planner plans feasible motion for the MMRs and generates trajectory for object transportation considering the kinodynamic constraints and the static and dynamic obstacles. The efficiency of our approach is validated by numerical simulation and hardware experiments in varied environments.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Newton Extremum Seeking using Delays and Time-Periodic Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study prescribed-time extremum seeking (ES) for scalar maps in the presence of time delay. The problem has been solved by Yilmaz and Krstic using chirpy probing and time-varying singular gains. To alleviate the gain singularity, we present an alternative approach, employing delays with bounded time-periodic gains, for achieving prescribed-time convergence to the extremum. Our results are not extensions or refinements but a new methodological direction, even in the absence of the delay on the map. The main result we present compensates the map's delay and uses perturbation-based and the Newton (rather than gradient) approaches. The simultaneous presence of perturbation period, and two delays -- a map delay and a seeking feedback delay -- whose values are different (feedback delay must be longer than map delay), makes for an intricate situation in the design and analysis.
  ES can settle arbitrarily soon after four times the map delay. In the absence of a map delay, the settling time is arbitrarily short, with feedback delay chosen as one quarter of the prescribed settling time, i.e., the search settles after four times any positive feedback delay. In addition to removing the gain singularity of the Yilmaz-Krstic singular-gain prescribed-time ES, we go beyond that method's limitation to operating only up to the terminal time. With the help of averaging theorems in infinite dimension, we conduct a prescribed-time convergence analysis on a suitable perturbation-averaged \textit{target} ES system, which contains the time-periodic gains of the map and feedback delays. Since the notion of ``dead-beat'' Lyapunov stabilization by time-periodic delayed feedback originates from Hale and Verduyn-Lunel (analysis, 1993) and Karafyllis (feedback design, 2006), we refer to our approach to prescribed-time ES as the ``Karafyllis, Hale, Verduyn-Lunel" (KHV) PT-ES approach.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time of the Proximal Sampler in Relative Fisher Information via Strong Data Processing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time guarantee for sampling in relative Fisher information via the Proximal Sampler algorithm, which is an approximate proximal discretization of the Langevin dynamics. We show that when the target probability distribution is strongly log-concave, the relative Fisher information converges exponentially fast along the Proximal Sampler; this matches the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the continuous-time Langevin dynamics for strongly log-concave target. When combined with a standard implementation of the Proximal Sampler via rejection sampling, this exponential convergence rate provides a high-accuracy iteration complexity guarantee for the Proximal Sampler in relative Fisher information when the target distribution is strongly log-concave and log-smooth. Our proof proceeds by establishing a strong data processing inequality for relative Fisher information along the Gaussian channel under strong log-concavity, and a data processing inequality along the reverse Gaussian channel for a special distribution. The forward and reverse Gaussian channels compose to form the Proximal Sampler, and these data processing inequalities imply the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the Proximal Sampler.</description>

We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Experimentation: Bayesian Optimization over Problem Formulation Space for Accelerated Alloy Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerated discovery in materials science demands autonomous systems capable of dynamically formulating and solving design problems. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages Bayesian optimization over a problem formulation space to identify optimal design formulations in line with decision-maker preferences. By mapping various design scenarios to a multi attribute utility function, our approach enables the system to balance conflicting objectives such as ductility, yield strength, density, and solidification range without requiring an exact problem definition at the outset. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through an in silico case study on a Mo-Nb-Ti-V-W alloy system targeted for gas turbine engine blade applications. The framework converges on a sweet spot that satisfies critical performance thresholds, illustrating that integrating problem formulation discovery into the autonomous design loop can significantly streamline the experimental process. Future work will incorporate human feedback to further enhance the adaptability of the system in real-world experimental settings.</description>

      <title>ID policy (with reassignment) is asymptotically optimal for heterogeneous weakly-coupled MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, a natural adaptation of the ID policy, although originally proposed for a homogeneous special case of WCMDPs, in fact achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our techniques highlight the construction of a novel projection-based Lyapunov function, which witnesses the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region in the presence of heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing with Adversarially-Censored Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an online dynamic pricing problem where the potential demand at each time period $t=1,2,\ldots, T$ is stochastic and dependent on the price. However, a perishable inventory is imposed at the beginning of each time $t$, censoring the potential demand if it exceeds the inventory level. To address this problem, we introduce a pricing algorithm based on the optimistic estimates of derivatives. We show that our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ optimal regret even with adversarial inventory series. Our findings advance the state-of-the-art in online decision-making problems with censored feedback, offering a theoretically optimal solution against adversarial observations.</description>

      <title>Analog In-memory Training on General Non-ideal Resistive Elements: The Impact of Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the economic and environmental costs of training and deploying large vision or language models increase dramatically, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) emerges as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, the training perspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC hardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive elements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses. Among all the physical properties of resistive elements, the response to the pulses directly affects the training dynamics. This paper first provides a theoretical foundation for gradient-based training on AIMC hardware and studies the impact of response functions. We demonstrate that noisy update and asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by imposing an implicit penalty term on the objective. To overcome the issue, Tiki-Taka, a residual learning algorithm, converges exactly to a critical point by optimizing a main array and a residual array bilevelly. The conclusion is supported by simulations validating our theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>A Linearly Convergent Algorithm for Computing the Petz-Augustin Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an iterative algorithm for computing the Petz-Augustin information of order $\alpha\in(1/2,1)\cup(1,\infty)$. The optimization error is guaranteed to converge at a rate of $O\left(\vert 1-1/\alpha \vert^T\right)$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Let $n$ denote the cardinality of the input alphabet of the classical-quantum channel, and $d$ the dimension of the quantum states. The algorithm has an initialization time complexity of $O\left(n d^{3}\right)$ and a per-iteration time complexity of $O\left(n d^{2}+d^3\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for computing the Petz-Augustin information with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee.</description>

      <title>Stochastic MPC with Online-optimized Policies and Closed-loop Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic model predictive control method for linear systems affected by additive Gaussian disturbances. Closed-loop satisfaction of probabilistic constraints and recursive feasibility of the underlying convex optimization problem is guaranteed. Optimization over feedback policies online increases performance and reduces conservatism compared to fixed-feedback approaches. The central mechanism is a finitely determined maximal admissible set for probabilistic constraints, together with the reconditioning of the predicted probabilistic constraints on the current knowledge at every time step. The proposed method's reduced conservatism and improved performance in terms of the achieved closed-loop cost is demonstrated in a numerical example.</description>

Abstract: In many machine learning tasks, known symmetries can be used as an inductive bias to improve model performance. In this paper, we consider learning group equivariance through training with data augmentation. We summarize results from a previous paper of our own, and extend the results to show that equivariance of the trained model can be achieved through training on augmented data in tandem with regularization.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation and Multiplier Bootstrap for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates in the central limit theorem for Polyak-Ruppert-averaged iterates of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our analysis builds on the result of the Gaussian approximation for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables of Shao and Zhang (2022). Using this result, we prove the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap for constructing the confidence sets for the optimal solution of an optimization problem. In particular, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>Learning an Optimal Assortment Policy under Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of offline assortment optimization under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, where sellers must determine the optimal subset of the products to offer based solely on historical customer choice data. While most existing approaches to learning-based assortment optimization focus on the online learning of the optimal assortment through repeated interactions with customers, such exploration can be costly or even impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we consider the offline learning paradigm and investigate the minimal data requirements for efficient offline assortment optimization. To this end, we introduce Pessimistic Rank-Breaking (PRB), an algorithm that combines rank-breaking with pessimistic estimation. We prove that PRB is nearly minimax optimal by establishing the tight suboptimality upper bound and a nearly matching lower bound. This further shows that "optimal item coverage" - where each item in the optimal assortment appears sufficiently often in the historical data - is both sufficient and necessary for efficient offline learning. This significantly relaxes the previous requirement of observing the complete optimal assortment in the data. Our results provide fundamental insights into the data requirements for offline assortment optimization under the MNL model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of iterative Bayesian smoothing in nonlinear state-space models with additive noise using Gaussian approximations. Iterative methods are known to improve smoothed estimates but are not guaranteed to converge, motivating the development of methods with better convergence properties. The aim of this article is to extend Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and line-search versions of the classical iterated extended Kalman smoother (IEKS) to the iterated posterior linearisation smoother (IPLS). The IEKS has previously been shown to be equivalent to the Gauss-Newton (GN) method. We derive a similar GN interpretation for the IPLS and use this to develop extensions to the IPLS, with improved convergence properties. We show that an LM extension for the IPLS can be achieved with a simple modification of the smoothing iterations, enabling algorithms with efficient implementations. We also derive the Armijo--Wolfe step length conditions for the IPLS enabling an efficient inexact line-search method. Our numerical experiments show the benefits of these extensions in highly nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Complexity of trust-region methods with unbounded Hessian approximations for smooth and nonsmooth optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a worst-case evaluation complexity bound for trust-region methods in the presence of unbounded Hessian approximations. We use the algorithm of arXiv:2103.15993v3 as a model, which is designed for nonsmooth regularized problems, but applies to unconstrained smooth problems as a special case. Our analysis assumes that the growth of the Hessian approximation is controlled by the number of successful iterations. We show that the best known complexity bound of $\epsilon^{-2}$ deteriorates to $\epsilon^{-2/(1-p)}$, where $0 \le p &lt; 1$ is a parameter that controls the growth of the Hessian approximation. The faster the Hessian approximation grows, the more the bound deteriorates. We construct an objective that satisfies all of our assumptions and for which our complexity bound is attained, which establishes that our bound is sharp. To the best of our knowledge, our complexity result is the first to consider potentially unbounded Hessians and is a first step towards addressing a conjecture of Powell [38] that trust-region methods may require an exponential number of iterations in such a case. Numerical experiments conducted in double precision arithmetic are consistent with the analysis.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Regularized Proximal Newton-Type Methods for Composite Optimization over the Stiefel Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the proximal Newton-type method and its variants have been generalized to solve composite optimization problems over the Stiefel manifold whose objective function is the summation of a smooth function and a nonsmooth function. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quadratically regularized proximal quasi-Newton method, named ARPQN, to solve this class of problems. Under some mild assumptions, the global convergence, the local linear convergence rate and the iteration complexity of ARPQN are established. Numerical experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods indicate that ARPQN is very promising. We also propose an adaptive quadratically regularized proximal Newton method, named ARPN. It is shown the ARPN method has a local superlinear convergence rate under certain reasonable assumptions, which demonstrates attractive convergence properties of regularized proximal Newton methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Level proximal subdifferential was introduced by Rockafellar recently for studying proximal mappings of possibly nonconvex functions. In this paper a systematic study of level proximal subdifferential is given. We characterize variational convexity of a function by local firm nonexpansiveness of proximal mappings or local relative monotonicity of level proximal subdifferential, and use them to study local convergence of proximal gradient method and others for variationally convex functions. Variational sufficiency guarantees that proximal gradient method converges to local minimizers rather than just critical points. We also investigate the existence, single-valuedness and integration of level proximal subdifferential, and quantify pointwise Lipschitz smoothness of a function. As a powerful tool, level proximal subdifferential provides deep insights into variational analysis and optimization.</description>

Abstract: Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a non-smooth elliptic PDE with non-linear term acting on the control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the investigations from [7] and is concerned with the derivation of first-order conditions for a control constrained optimization problem governed by a non-smooth elliptic PDE. The control enters the state equation not only linearly but also as the argument of a regularization of the Heaviside function. The non-linearity which acts on the state is locally Lipschitz-continuous and not necessarily differentiable, i.e., non-smooth. This excludes the application of standard adjoint calculus. We derive conditions under which a strong stationary optimality system can be established, i.e., a system that is equivalent to the purely primal optimality condition saying that the directional derivative of the reduced objective in feasible directions is nonnegative. For this, two assumptions are made on the unknown optimizer. Some of the presented findings are employed in the recent contribution [8], where limit optimality systems for non-smooth shape optimization problems [7] are established.</description>

      <title>SLRQA: A Sparse Low-Rank Quaternion Model for Color Image Processing with Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Sparse Low-rank Quaternion Approximation (SLRQA) model for color image processing problems with noisy observations. %Different from the existing color image processing models, The proposed SLRQA is a quaternion model that combines low-rankness and sparsity priors without an initial rank estimation. %Furthermore, it does not need an initial rank estimate. A proximal linearized ADMM (PL-ADMM) algorithm is proposed to solve SLRQA and the global convergence is guaranteed under standard assumptions. %where only one variable is linearized. When the observation is noise-free, a limiting case of the SLRQA, called SLRQA-NF, is proposed. Subsequently, a proximal linearized ADMM (PL-ADMM-NF) algorithm for SLRQA-NF is given. Since SLRQA-NF does not satisfy a widely-used assumption for global convergence of ADMM-type algorithms, we propose a novel assumption, under which the global convergence of PL-ADMM-NF is established. In numerical experiments, we verify the effectiveness of quaternion representation. Furthermore, for color image denoising and color image inpainting problems, SLRQA and SLRQA-NF demonstrate superior performance both quantitatively and visually when compared with some state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability of systems governed by conformable fractional order derivatives. It first establishes the existence and uniqueness of evolution operators for non-autonomous fractional-order homogeneous systems, using a suitable initial time defined as the intersection of two specific time intervals. Using the theory of linear evolution operators, Schauder's fixed-point theorem, and the Banach contraction principle, the study derives a new set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to non-autonomous conformable fractional semi-linear systems. Additionally, the paper examines the exact null controllability of abstract systems based on the mild solution. We provide a comprehensive example to demonstrate the applicability of the established theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Ergodic-risk Criterion for Stochastically Stabilizing Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ergodic-risk criteria, which capture long-term cumulative risks associated with controlled Markov chains through probabilistic limit theorems--in contrast to existing methods that require assumptions of either finite hitting time, finite state/action space, or exponentiation necessitating light-tailed distributions. Using tailored Functional Central Limit Theorems (FCLT), we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in the ergodic-risk] criteria converge under uniform ergodicity and establish conditions for the convergence of these criteria in non-stationary general-state Markov chains involving heavy-tailed distributions. For quadratic risk functionals on stochastic linear system, in addition to internal stability, this requires the (possibly heavy-tailed) process noise to have only a finite fourth moment. After quantifying cumulative uncertainties in risk functionals that account for extreme deviations, these ergodic-risk criteria are then incorporated into policy optimizations, thereby extending the standard average optimal synthesis to a risk-sensitive framework. Finally, by establishing the strong duality of the constrained policy optimization, we propose a primal-dual algorithm that optimizes average performance while ensuring that certain risks associated with these ergodic-risk criteria are constrained. Our risk-sensitive framework offers a theoretically guaranteed policy iteration for the long-term risk-sensitive control of processes involving heavy-tailed noise, which is shown to be effective through several simulations.</description>

Abstract: The population control problem is a parameterized control problem where a population of agents has to be moved simultaneously into a target state. The decision problem asks whether this can be achieved %it is possible to do so, for an finite but arbitrarily large population. We focus on the \emph{random} version of this problem, where every agent is a copy of the same automaton and non-determinism on the {global} action chosen by the controller is resolved independently and uniformly at random. Controller seeks to almost-surely gather the agents in the target states. We show that the random population control problem is exptime-complete.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been a go-to algorithm for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems arising in machine learning. Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties. We hereby present a full scope convergence study of biased nonconvex SGD, including weak convergence, function-value convergence and global convergence, and also provide subsequent convergence rates and complexities, all under relatively mild conditions in comparison with literature.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Gradient Descent for Optimal Auto-Scaling in Serverless Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To efficiently manage serverless computing platforms, a key aspect is the auto-scaling of services, i.e., the set of computational resources allocated to a service adapts over time as a function of the traffic demand. The objective is to find a compromise between user-perceived performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we consider the \emph{scale-per-request} auto-scaling pattern and investigate how many function instances (or servers) should be spawned each time an \emph{unfortunate} job arrives, i.e., a job that finds all servers busy upon its arrival. We address this problem by following a stochastic optimization approach: we develop a stochastic gradient descent scheme of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz type that applies \emph{over a single run of the state evolution}. At each iteration, the proposed scheme computes an estimate of the number of servers to spawn each time an unfortunate job arrives to minimize some cost function. Under natural assumptions, we show that the sequence of estimates produced by our scheme is asymptotically optimal almost surely. In addition, we prove that its convergence rate is $O(n^{-2/3})$ where $n$ is the number of iterations.
  From a mathematical point of view, the stochastic optimization framework induced by auto-scaling exhibits non-standard aspects that we approach from a general point of view. We consider the setting where a controller can only get samples of the \emph{transient} -- rather than stationary -- behavior of the underlying stochastic system. To handle this difficulty, we develop arguments that exploit properties of the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain. By means of numerical simulations, we validate the proposed approach and quantify its gain with respect to common existing scale-up rules.</description>

      <title>A Bregman ADMM for Bethe variational problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel Bregman ADMM with nonlinear dual update to solve the Bethe variational problem (BVP), a key optimization formulation in graphical models and statistical physics. Our algorithm provides rigorous convergence guarantees, even if the objective function of BVP is non-convex and non-Lipschitz continuous on the boundary. A central result of our analysis is proving that the entries in local minima of BVP are strictly positive, effectively resolving non-smoothness issues caused by zero entries. Beyond theoretical guarantees, the algorithm possesses high level of separability and parallelizability to achieve highly efficient subproblem computation. Our Bregman ADMM can be easily extended to solve the quantum Bethe variational problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Based on this research, we have released an open-source package of the proposed method at https://github.com/TTYmath/BADMM-BVP.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyse the discretisation of a recently proposed new Lagrangian approach to optimal control problems of affine-controlled second-order differential equations with cost functions quadratic in the controls. We propose exact discrete and semi-discrete versions of the problem, providing new tools to develop numerical methods. Discrete necessary conditions for optimality are derived and their equivalence with the continuous version is proven. A family of low-order integration schemes is devised to find approximate optimality conditions, and used to solve a low-thrust orbital transfer problem. Non-trivial equivalent standard direct methods are constructed. Noether's theorem for the new Lagrangian approach is investigated in the exact and approximate cases.</description>

Abstract: The task of simultaneously reconstructing multiple physical coefficients in partial differential equations (PDEs) from observed data is ubiquitous in applications. In this work, we propose an integrated data-driven and model-based iterative reconstruction framework for such joint inversion problems where additional data on the unknown coefficients are supplemented for better reconstructions. Our method couples the supplementary data with the PDE model to make the data-driven modeling process consistent with the model-based reconstruction procedure. We characterize the impact of learning uncertainty on the joint inversion results for two typical inverse problems. Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of using data-driven models to improve the joint inversion of multiple coefficients in PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the optimal regulation of energy production in alignment with the long-term goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. We analyze the optimal regulatory incentives to foster the development of non-emissive electricity generation when the demand for power is met either by a single firm or by two interacting agents. The regulator aims to encourage green investments to limit carbon emissions while simultaneously reducing the intermittency of total energy production. We find that the regulator can achieve a higher certainty equivalent by regulating two interacting firms, each investing in one technology, rather than a single firm managing both technologies. This higher value is achieved thanks to a greater degree of freedom in the incentive mechanisms, which involve cross-subsidies between firms. Moreover, we find that it is optimal to compensate firms for shutting down their emissive production assets. We provide closed-form expressions of the second-best contracts and show that they take a rebate form, involving time-dependent prices for each state variable. A numerical study quantifies the impact of the designed second-best contract in both market structures compared to the business-as-usual scenario.</description>

      <title>UniAP: Unifying Inter- and Intra-Layer Automatic Parallelism by Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16375v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning is commonly used for training deep learning models, especially large models. In distributed learning, manual parallelism (MP) methods demand considerable human effort and have limited flexibility. Hence, automatic parallelism (AP) methods have recently been proposed for automating the parallel strategy optimization process. Existing AP methods suffer from sub-optimal solutions because they do not jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies (i.e., inter-layer parallelism and intra-layer parallelism). In this paper, we propose a novel AP method called UniAP, which unifies inter- and intra-layer automatic parallelism by mixed integer quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first parallel method that can jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies to find an optimal solution. Experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.80$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy optimization time by up to 107$\times$ across five Transformer-based models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new denial-of-service (DoS) estimator, enabling defenders to identify duration and frequency parameters of any DoS attacker, except for three edge cases, exclusively using real-time data. The key advantage of the estimator lies in its capability to facilitate security control in a wide range of practical scenarios, even when the attacker's information is previously unknown. We demonstrate the advantage and application of our new estimator in the context of two classical control scenarios, namely consensus of multi-agent systems and impulsive stabilization of nonlinear systems, for illustration.</description>

Abstract: The present study explores an original problem that can be resolved by employing the notion of a PDG, yet cannot by using a restricted game. The following situation is considered: First, it is assumed that the worth of the grand and singleton coalitions are known. It takes some amount of costs to obtain worth of larger coalitions. If it is performed, then the worth of the grand coalition is decreased by the value of a cost function. The problem of a partially defined game with payments is finding the solution of partially defined games at each point and the best exiting rule of examinations of coalitional worth.</description>

      <title>Communication-efficient Vertical Federated Learning via Compressed Error Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication overhead is a known bottleneck in federated learning (FL). To address this, lossy compression is commonly used on the information communicated between the server and clients during training. In horizontal FL, where each client holds a subset of the samples, such communication-compressed training methods have recently seen significant progress. However, in their vertical FL counterparts, where each client holds a subset of the features, our understanding remains limited. To address this, we propose an error feedback compressed vertical federated learning (EF-VFL) method to train split neural networks. In contrast to previous communication-compressed methods for vertical FL, EF-VFL does not require a vanishing compression error for the gradient norm to converge to zero for smooth nonconvex problems. By leveraging error feedback, our method can achieve a $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate for a sufficiently large batch size, improving over the state-of-the-art $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ compression error, and matching the rate of uncompressed methods. Further, when the objective function satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, our method converges linearly. In addition to improving convergence, our method also supports the use of private labels. Numerical experiments show that EF-VFL significantly improves over the prior art, confirming our theoretical results. The code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Valdeira/EF-VFL.</description>

      <title>Privacy of the last iterate in cyclically-sampled DP-SGD on nonconvex composite losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is a family of iterative machine learning training algorithms that privatize gradients to generate a sequence of differentially-private (DP) model parameters. It is also the standard tool used to train DP models in practice, even though most users are only interested in protecting the privacy of the final model. Tight DP accounting for the last iterate would minimize the amount of noise required while maintaining the same privacy guarantee and potentially increasing model utility. However, last-iterate accounting is challenging, and existing works require strong assumptions not satisfied by most implementations. These include assuming (i) the global sensitivity constant is known - to avoid gradient clipping; (ii) the loss function is Lipschitz or convex; and (iii) input batches are sampled randomly.
  In this work, we forego any unrealistic assumptions and provide privacy bounds for the most commonly used variant of DP-SGD, in which data is traversed cyclically, gradients are clipped, and only the last model is released. More specifically, we establish new Renyi differential privacy (RDP) upper bounds for the last iterate under realistic assumptions of small stepsize and Lipschitz smoothness of the loss function. Our general bounds also recover the special-case convex bounds when the weak-convexity parameter of the objective function approaches zero and no clipping is performed. The approach itself leverages optimal transport techniques for last iterate bounds, which is a nontrivial task when the data is traversed cyclically and the loss function is nonconvex.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Reaction-Diffusion Epidemic Model with Noncompliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an optimal distributed control problem for a reaction-diffusion-based SIR epidemic model with human behavioral effects. We develop a model wherein non-pharmaceutical intervention methods are implemented, but a portion of the population does not comply with them, and this noncompliance affects the spread of the disease. Drawing from social contagion theory, our model allows for the spread of noncompliance parallel to the spread of the disease. The quantities of interest for control are the reduction in infection rate among the compliant population, the rate of spread of noncompliance, and the rate at which non-compliant individuals become compliant after, e.g., receiving more or better information about the underlying disease. We prove the existence of global-in-time solutions for fixed controls and study the regularity properties of the resulting control-to-state map. The existence of optimal control is then established in an abstract framework for a fairly general class of objective functions. Necessary first--order optimality conditions are obtained via a Lagrangian based stationarity system. We conclude with a discussion regarding minimization of the size of infected and non-compliant populations and present simulations with various parameters values to demonstrate the behavior of the model.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Policy Identification in Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes via Epigraph Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a safe policy for uncertain environments is crucial in real-world control systems. However, this challenge remains inadequately addressed within the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. This paper presents the first algorithm guaranteed to identify a near-optimal policy in a robust constrained MDP (RCMDP), where an optimal policy minimizes cumulative cost while satisfying constraints in the worst-case scenario across a set of environments. We first prove that the conventional policy gradient approach to the Lagrangian max-min formulation can become trapped in suboptimal solutions. This occurs when its inner minimization encounters a sum of conflicting gradients from the objective and constraint functions. To address this, we leverage the epigraph form of the RCMDP problem, which resolves the conflict by selecting a single gradient from either the objective or the constraints. Building on the epigraph form, we propose a bisection search algorithm with a policy gradient subroutine and prove that it identifies an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an RCMDP with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ robust policy evaluations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Maximum Cut on Low-Girth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum cut (MaxCut) on graphs is a classic NP-hard problem. In quantum computing, Farhi, Gutmann, and Goldstone proposed the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving the MaxCut problem. Its guarantee on cut fraction (the fraction of edges in the output cut over all edges) was mainly studied for high-girth graphs, i.e., graphs with only long cycles. On the other hand, low-girth graphs are ubiquitous in theoretical computer science, including expander graphs being outstanding examples with wide applications in theory and beyond. In this paper, we apply QAOA to MaxCut on a set of expander graphs proposed by Mohanty and O'Donnell known as additive product graphs. Additionally, we apply multi-angle QAOA (ma-QAOA) to better utilize the graph structure of additive product graphs in ansatz design. In theory, we derive an iterative formula to calculate the expected cut fraction of such graphs. This formula also extends to the quantum MaxCut problem. On the other hand, we conduct numerical experiments to compare between best-known classical local algorithms and QAOA with constant depth. Our results demonstrate that QAOA outperforms the best-known classical algorithms by 0.3% to 5.2% on several additive product graphs, while ma-QAOA further enhances this advantage by an additional 0.6% to 2.5%. In particular, we observe cases that ma-QAOA exhibits superiority over best-known classical algorithms but QAOA does not. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to planar graphs such as tiling grid graphs, where QAOA also demonstrates an advantage.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>Coupled Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Min-Max and Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for two-player infinite-dimensional games with cooperative or competitive structure. These games take the form of coupled partial differential equations in which players optimize over a space of measures, driven by either a gradient descent or gradient descent-ascent in Wasserstein-2 space. We characterize the properties of the Nash equilibrium of the system, and relate it to the steady state of the dynamics. In the min-max setting, we show, under sufficient convexity conditions, that solutions converge exponentially fast and with explicit rate to the unique Nash equilibrium. Similar results are obtained for the cooperative setting. We apply this framework to distribution shift induced by interactions among a strategic population of agents and an algorithm, proving additional convergence results in the timescale-separated setting. We illustrate the performance of our model on (i) real data from an economics study on Colombia census data, (ii) feature modification in loan applications, and (iii) performative prediction. The numerical experiments demonstrate the importance of distribution-level, rather than moment-level, modeling.</description>

      <title>MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks--and more recently, large models demands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin. The implementation of MARS is available at https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS.</description>

      <title>Online Experimental Design With Estimation-Regret Trade-off Under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network interference has attracted significant attention in the field of causal inference, encapsulating various sociological behaviors where the treatment assigned to one individual within a network may affect the outcomes of others, such as their neighbors. A key challenge in this setting is that standard causal inference methods often assume independent treatment effects among individuals, which may not hold in networked environments. To estimate interference-aware causal effects, a traditional approach is to inherit the independent settings, where practitioners randomly assign experimental participants into different groups and compare their outcomes. While effective in offline settings, this strategy becomes problematic in sequential experiments, where suboptimal decision persists, leading to substantial regret. To address this issue, we introduce a unified interference-aware framework for online experimental design. Compared to existing studies, we extend the definition of arm space by utilizing the statistical concept of exposure mapping, which allows for a more flexible and context-aware representation of treatment effects in networked settings. Crucially, we establish a Pareto-optimal trade-off between estimation accuracy and regret under the network concerning both time period and arm space, which remains superior to baseline models even without network interference. Furthermore, we propose an algorithmic implementation and discuss its generalization across different learning settings and network topology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Economic Model Predictive Control: Performance Guarantees for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the economic performance of nonlinear constrained systems subject to uncertain time-varying parameters and bounded disturbances. In particular, we propose an adaptive economic model predictive control (MPC) framework that: (i) directly minimizes transient economic costs, (ii) addresses parametric uncertainty through online model adaptation, (iii) determines optimal setpoints online, and (iv) ensures robustness by using a tube-based approach. The proposed design ensures recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and a transient performance bound. In case the disturbances have a finite energy and the parameter variations have a finite path length, the asymptotic average performance is (approximately) not worse than the performance obtained when operating at the best reachable steady-state. We highlight performance benefits in a numerical example involving a chemical reactor with unknown time-invariant and time-varying parameters.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Control for Bragg Pulse Design in Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a robust optimal control algorithm to synthesize minimum energy pulses that can transfer a cold atom system into various momentum states. The algorithm uses adaptive linearization of the evolution operator and sequential quadratic programming to iterate the control towards a minimum energy signal that achieves optimal target state fidelity. Robustness to parameter variation is achieved using Legendre polynomial approximation over the domain of variation. The method is applied to optimize the Bragg beamsplitting operation in ultra-cold atom interferometry. Even in the presence of 10-40% variability in the initial momentum dispersion of the atomic cloud and the intensity of the optical pulse, the algorithm reliably converges to a control protocol that robustly achieves unprecedented momentum levels with high fidelity for a single-frequency multi-photon Bragg diffraction scheme (e.g. $|\pm 40\hbar k\rangle$). Advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparison to stochastic optimization using sampled parameter values.</description>

Abstract: Global bundle adjustment is made easy by depth prediction and convex optimization. We (i) propose a scaled bundle adjustment (SBA) formulation that lifts 2D keypoint measurements to 3D with learned depth, (ii) design an empirically tight convex semidfinite program (SDP) relaxation that solves SBA to certfiable global optimality, (iii) solve the SDP relaxations at extreme scale with Burer-Monteiro factorization and a CUDA-based trust-region Riemannian optimizer (dubbed XM), (iv) build a structure from motion (SfM) pipeline with XM as the optimization engine and show that XM-SfM dominates or compares favorably with existing SfM pipelines in terms of reconstruction quality while being faster, more scalable, and initialization-free.</description>
