      <title>Hierarchical bayesian inference: constraining population distribution of dark matter halo shapes via stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams, the debris of tidally disrupted satellites, trace their host's gravitational potential and thus probe dark matter halo structure. While six-dimensional phase-space data of Galactic streams enable precise dark matter halo modelling in the Milky Way, streams around external galaxies are typically available only as low surface brightness features without kinematics (i.e. two-dimensional photometric data), providing only weak constraints when considered individually. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that infers the population distribution of halo flattening using only projected stream tracks. Streams are forward-modelled in StreaMAX, a new JAX-accelerated particle-spray package that achieves orders of magnitude faster stream generation when compared to traditional methods. For each stream we fit an axisymmetric dark matter halo model and obtain a posterior on the flattening. These posteriors are then combined through hierarchical reweighting to constrain the population distribution. Using mock data, we show that individual fits recover the correct flattening with modest precision and exhibit projection-induced multi-modalities. Nevertheless, aggregating these fits yields accurate and confident constraints on the underlying population distribution of dark matter halo morphologies, clearly distinguishing between oblate, spherical, and prolate populations. The total computational cost scales linearly with sample size. Our results demonstrate that ensembles of purely photometric streams carry sufficient information to constrain dark matter halo shapes in external galaxies at the population level. With the forthcoming samples from Euclid and Rubin/LSST, this approach offers a practical path to population-level inferences of halo morphology without any kinematic measurements.</description>

      <title>What factors shape the radio luminosity of star-forming galaxies? A new calibration from LoTSS-DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations offer a dust-unobscured view of galaxy star formation via the radio continuum-star formation rate (RC--SFR) relation. Emerging evidence of a stellar mass dependence in the RC--SFR relation raises the broader question of how other galaxy properties may influence this relation. In this work, we study the dependence of the global RC--SFR relation on galaxy properties in local ($z\,\leq$\,0.3) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2). Employing a non-parametric decision-tree regression algorithm, we identify the most important galaxy properties for estimating the radio luminosity using a sample of 18,828 emission-line-classified SFGs based on spectroscopic data from the SDSS-DR8. Along with the spectroscopically obtained SFRs and stellar mass values, we also use SFRs and stellar masses derived using photometric SED-fitting from the \textit{GALEX}--SDSS--\textit{WISE} Legacy Catalogue (GSWLC) for the same sample. We find that a galaxy's SFR is most important for predicting the radio luminosity, followed by the stellar mass, at $&gt;5\sigma$ significance. Complementing the LoTSS catalogue 150\,MHz flux densities with aperture photometry for the rest of the emission-line classified sample (35,099 galaxies in total), we obtain a new calibration of the RC--SFR relation, which does not change significantly whether we use spectroscopic or photometrically derived SFRs and stellar masses, despite the fact that the methods probe star formation on different characteristic timescales. Our results highlight the utility of decision-tree algorithms for handling censored radio-selected galaxy samples, which will be useful for future spectroscopic surveys of radio sources.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Optical Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in AGN Light Curves: Fourier versus Bayesian Periodicity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations predict that supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) will exhibit periodic brightness variations that may exceed the stochastic variability intrinsic to active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this paper, we simulate SMBHBs with damped random walk (DRW) AGN variability and an added sinusoidal signal from the orbital motion, and test three methods -- the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram (GLSP), the nested Bayesian sampler (NBS), and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ) -- to determine which is best at recovering the periodicity. Our simulated light curves follow the properties of the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to best inform current and future SMBHB searches. We map a broad range of parameter space and identify which DRW-only light curves best mimic periodicity and pass each method's model selection. The NBS performs best at detecting periodicity and filtering out DRW-only light curves. Combined candidate selection with both the NBS and GLSP significantly reduces false positive rates with marginal impact to true positive rates. With this joint model selection pipeline, we find the lowest false positive rates in ZTF-like simulations and the highest detection rates in LSST-like simulations. Using a modified computation of the False Alarm Probability (FAP) with GLSP, we efficiently triage LSST AGN light curves (~10^7 light curves in ~10-30 hours) and achieve true- and false- positive rates of ~40% and ~0.5%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Blazars define a stable celestial reference frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that optical-radio position offsets and radio position variability are inversely correlated with the photometric variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). A key prediction of these findings is that a reference frame constructed using highly photometrically variable AGN should be more stable than a frame that does not account for variability and that variability can be used to optimally weight all sources in order to maximize frame stability. Using ICRF3 matched to Gaia DR3, we employed a bootstrap method to estimate the multi-epoch stability of frames constructed using AGN selected at varying levels of photometric variability. We fit vector spherical harmonics to the coordinate differences between the three ICRF3 frames (S/X, K, and X/Ka) and Gaia and quantified the statistical dispersion as a function of blazar-like (high variability), quasar-like (low variability), and intermediate-variability class. An S/X reference frame constructed using blazars exceeds the stability of a frame constructed with quasars by a factor of 6 and is twice as stable as the ICRF3 defining sources. At K and X/Ka, a blazar-based frame matches or exceeds the stability of the defining sources by a factor of 1.4 in the case of X/Ka and exceeds the stability of a frame based on quasars by over a factor of 2 in both cases. The smaller improvement at K and X/Ka is likely because sources selected at higher frequency are more likely to be blazars. We derived a variability-based astrometric covariance scaling method that results in factor of 2 reduction in frame distortions and instabilities between S/X and Gaia, with a mild improvement for K but no difference for X/Ka, which is dominated by known distortions. Our results confirm the prediction that an optimal weighting of the link between the optical and radio celestial reference frames is enabled by accounting for photometric variability.</description>

      <title>A Stratification in Magnetic Field Structures: The Radio Outflow in NGC 4151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of radio outflows in radio-quiet AGN remains poorly understood. In this study, we present kpc-scale polarization observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC\,4151 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in B-array at 3 and 10 GHz. We find that the inferred magnetic (B-) field structures show a stratification: a `spine-sheath'-like structure, with fields perpendicular to the jet direction in the `spine' and parallel in the `sheath', is observed in the higher resolution (0.5 arcsec) image at 10 GHz. In addition, a `wind'-like component with B-fields perpendicular to the radio outflow is observed in the 3 GHz image (resolution 2 arcsec); this feature is prominent along the `receding' (eastern) jet direction. Rotation measure (RM) ranges from $-230$ to 250 rad m$^{-2}$ over the polarized regions, indicating a low-electron-density ($10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) tenuous medium surrounding the source causing Faraday rotation. A {tentative} RM gradient of $+75$ to $-25$ rad m$^{-2}$ is observed transverse to the northern `wind' component, while a similar gradient with opposite sign is seen across the southern `wind' component, suggestive of a helical magnetic field threading the outflow. Based on an analysis of the available radio and X-ray data, we conclude that the stratified radio outflow in NGC 4151 is magnetically-driven. The bi-conical radio `wind' is found to be massive ($1050-3200 M_\odot$) with a high mass outflow rate ($0.01-0.03$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) but low in kinetic power ($&lt;0.01$% of L$_{\rm{bol}}$), making it less impactful for galactic-scale feedback. Our study suggests that radio-quiet AGN may also host magnetically dominant jets and winds, even while their jets are smaller and weaker compared to radio-loud AGN.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of 5-year Simultaneous X-ray and Radio Light Curves of the Dwarf Seyfert Galaxy UGC 6728</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present serendipitous simultaneous radio and X-ray light curves of the dwarf Seyfert galaxy UGC 6728 spanning 5 years. The X-ray light curve exhibits a flaring period, followed by a gradual rise and decline. Throughout these events, the X-ray hardness ratio and spectrum do not change significantly. The radio flux is constant, as far as can be determined from its sparse sampling, until the end of the X-ray flare, then decreases by a factor of two by the midpoint of the gradual X-ray rise before returning to baseline at the end of the X-ray decline. We interpret this behavior in light of a similar event recently reported in NGC 2992, in which there is a temporary obscuration of the radio source by a blob of plasma ejected by a magnetic reconnection in the accretion disk. The energetics of the X-ray flare are consistent with those expected from magnetic disk activity. As in NGC 2992, the X-ray spectrum does not evolve during the obscuration event. We also discuss the possibility that the observed phenomena are due to normal AGN coronal flaring and variability, which is plausible but unlikely given the lack of spectral variation.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of AGN Feedback in the Compact Galaxy Group Stephan's Quintet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact galaxy groups are ideal laboratories for studying the effects of interactions between AGN and multiple nearby galaxies. Recent JWST observations of the nearby compact group Stephan's Quintet highlight tidal flows between the interacting galaxies as well as outflows from the active galaxy NGC 7319. To study the kinematics on a large scale throughout the group, we obtained spatially-resolved long-slit spectra of Stephan's Quintet at multiple slit positions with Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph. We fit multiple Gaussians to the H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563 \r{A} and [N II] $\lambda\lambda$6548, 6583 \r{A} emission lines to isolate the different kinematic components. We used the kinematics to develop the first biconical outflow model of the narrow-line region of NGC 7319. Using a combination of galactic rotation models, biconical outflow models, and kinematic maps of the ionized gas, we disentangled the outflows, rotation, and tidal flows in the group. We found outflow radial velocities up to 550 km s$^{-1}$ peaking at 2.6 kpc from the central supermassive black hole, and a transition from AGN-powered outflows to gravitationally-powered tidal flows at a projected distance between 2.4 -- 6.3 kpc. We performed a line ratio analysis and determined the gas shows Seyfert-like ionization out to 6.3 kpc (projected), which supports our finding that gas outside this radius is predominantly powered by tidal flows. Our separation of kinematic components in Stephan's Quintet will enable future studies of the physical conditions and dynamical forces in the ionized gas to better quantify the feeding and feedback processes of AGN in compact groups.</description>

      <title>The role of gas stripping in the quenching of satellite galaxies using SHARK v2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational studies have made substantial progress in characterizing quenching as a function of stellar mass and environment, but they are often limited in their ability to constrain quenching timescales and to determine the dominant environmental process responsible for the shutting down of star formation. To address this, we combine recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations with the SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to study the quenching of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters. We generate mock SDSS-like observations to calibrate the hot halo and cold interstellar medium (ISM) gas stripping prescriptions against observed satellite quenched fractions, finding that the previously adopted stripping prescriptions in SHARK v2.0 are too aggressive and overestimate the quenched fraction of satellite galaxies. Reducing the efficiency of both hot and cold gas stripping yields excellent agreement with observations for low- and intermediate-mass satellite galaxies. We use the calibrated model to investigate quenching timescales and find that satellites quench more quickly in clusters compared to groups, with timescales that generally decrease with increasing stellar mass. The long (&gt;2 Gyr) timescales we measure favour hot halo gas removal as the dominant driver of satellite quenching.</description>

      <title>Multi-band Reconstruction of Sixteen Gravitational Lens Systems using PISCO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation surveys such as the Euclid survey, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey are expected to discover ~10^5 galaxy-galaxy scale strong gravitational lenses. This motivates the development of scalable and robust lens modeling approaches that can efficiently and reliably learn from wide-field survey datasets before high-resolution follow-up. We design a scalable, Bayesian, Lenstronomy-based pipeline and apply it to a sample of sixteen lens candidates observed with the Parallel Imager for Southern Cosmology Observations (PISCO) on the Magellan telescope. PISCO provides four-band imaging (z, i, r, g) with colours, depth and seeing conditions comparable to LSST. To fully exploit the constraining power of this dataset, our pipeline performs simultaneous multi-band modeling, using a common mass profile across all four bands while allowing independent light profiles in each. This approach leverages color information to provide joint constraints on the lens mass and yields reduced uncertainties compared to single-band analyses. Fifteen out of sixteen PISCO lens candidates are successfully recovered with interpretable lensing configurations, including DESJ0533-2536, the first reported hyperbolic-umbilic galaxy-galaxy scale strong lensing candidate. We further assess how much model complexity can be reliably constrained given the resolution and seeing of PISCO-like data. Overall, our results demonstrate that scalable, multi-band lens modeling of ground-based data can extract meaningful constraints on mass and source morphology, providing a practical pathway to maximize the scientific return from large samples in upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>K-DRIFT Science Theme: Galactic Cirrus Clouds and Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the extended halo material and the circumgalactic medium (CGM), including both dust and gas, and discuss promising science cases that could be realized using the KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT). Scattered starlight from cirrus clouds in our Galaxy poses one of the major challenges to studying the low surface brightness features of extragalactic sources. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how to discriminate extragalactic sources from the cirrus cloud features. At the same time, interstellar dust clouds themselves are fundamental to understanding dust properties and the interstellar radiation field, both of which are essential for studies of chemical evolution and star formation in our Galaxy. Measuring the reddening of background sources, such as quasars, with K-DRIFT, which benefits from its broad field of view and accurate background subtraction, allows for effective detection of extended dust in galactic halos, the CGM, and intracluster space. Observations of the H-alpha emission lines can be used to identify signatures of star formation activity within galaxies, as well as the environmental effects acting on them. Galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei and starbursts can be traced through H-alpha emission. Strong ram pressure stripping effectively removes the interstellar medium (ISM) from galaxies. The stripped ISM becomes ionized or dissociated through mixing with the hot intracluster medium (ICM), forming H-alpha tails. The surface brightness of these H-alpha tails correlates not only with the presence of star formation in the tails but also the mixing stage of the stripped ISM and ICM. The H-alpha survey with K-DRIFT will enable the investigation of the evolutionary stages of ram pressure stripped galaxies in cluster environments, as well as the multiphase gas reservoir around galaxies and in the CGM.</description>

      <title>Deuteration of HC3N and CH3CCH in the pre-stellar core L1544</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterated molecules are a useful diagnostic tool to probe the evolution and the kinematics in the earliest stages of star formation. Due to the low temperatures and high densities in the centre of pre-stellar cores, the deuterium fraction is enhanced by several orders of magnitude. We study the distribution of the emission and the deuteration of the two carbon chains HC3N and CH3CCH throughout the pre-stellar core L1544. We analyse emission maps of CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CCD, HC3N, HCC13CN, and DC3N, observed with the IRAM 30m single-dish radio telescope. We use non-LTE radiative transfer calculations, combined with chemical modelling of the molecular abundances, to constrain physical parameters of the observed species. Following this, we derive the column density and deuteration maps. We find D-fractions of N(DC3N)/N(HC3N)=0.04-0.07, N(CH2DCCH)/N(CH3CCH)=0.09-0.15, and N(CH3CCD)/N(CH3CCH)=0.07-0.09. The deuteration of HC3N appears homogeneous across the core, with widespread D-fraction values above 0.06, tracing intermediate-density gas in the outer layers of the core. CH3CCD is most efficiently formed in the higher-density regions towards the core centre, while the D-fraction of CH2DCCH traces a local density enhancement in the north-east of the core, coinciding with the CH3OH emission peak. The results suggest that gas-phase reactions dominate the formation and deuteration of both HC3N and CH3CCH in L1544, with spatial variations driven by physical structure, density and external radiation. The significantly higher D-fraction of CH2DCCH compared to CH3CCD and a tentative gradient with higher values in the north suggest different deuteration mechanisms for the two functional groups. Similarities between the CH2DCCH emission and CH2DOH might indicate an additional deuteration pathway of CH3CCH on the surfaces of dust grains, as observed for H2CO.</description>

      <title>JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Data Release 5: NIRCam Imaging in GOODS-S and GOODS-N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging products of the fifth data release (DR5) of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JADES survey is one of the most ambitious programs yet conducted on JWST, producing deep infrared imaging and multiobject spectroscopy on the GOODS-S and GOODS-N extragalactic deep fields in order to explore galaxies to the earliest epoch. Here we describe the NIRCam data reduction procedures that result in deep and well-characterized mosaics in up to 18 filters covering 469 arcmin$^2$, with 250 arcmin$^2$ having at least 8 filters of coverage. This release contains the full NIRCam imaging of JADES, over 800 JWST mission hours, as well as co-reductions of 19 other programs in these two premier deep fields. We perform detailed tests on the final data products, thereby characterizing the photometric properties, point-spread function, and astrometric alignment. We release mosaics for individual programs (or epochs, depending on scheduling) and the mosaics combining data from all programs in order to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry.</description>

      <title>JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Data Release 5: MIRI Coordinated Parallels in GOODS-S and GOODS-N</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium to ultra-deep mid-infrared imaging surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)'s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are reframing our view of the early Universe, from the emergence of ultra-red dusty and quiescent galaxies to the epoch of reionization to the first galaxies. Here we present the MIRI coordinated parallels component of the JADES program, which obtained ultra-deep (155 ks) imaging at $7.7 \mu$m over $\sim10$ arcmin$^2$ as well as medium depth ($\sim5-15$ ks) imaging at $7.7, 12.8$, and $15 \mu$m over $\sim36$, 25, and 22 arcmin$^2$, respectively, in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. This paper describes the data reduction, which combines the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom steps to optimize flagging of warm/hot pixels and optimize background subtraction. We further introduce a new step to address artifacts caused by persistence from saturating sources. The final, fully reduced JADES/MIRI mosaics are being released as part of JADES Data Release 5, along with prior-based forced photometry using NIRCam detection images, providing critical rest-frame near-infrared and optical constraints on early galaxy populations.</description>

      <title>JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Data Release 5: Photometric Catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JADES Data Release 5 (DR5) photometric catalogs and describes the methodologies used for source detection, deblending, photometry, uncertainty estimation, and catalog curation. The catalogs are constructed from 35 space-based imaging mosaics obtained with JWST/NIRCam, JWST/MIRI, HST/ACS, and HST/WFC3, combining approximately 1250 hours of JADES imaging with extensive additional public JWST and HST observations in the GOODS fields. Sources are identified using custom signal-to-noise-based detection and deblending algorithms optimized for the depth, resolution, and complex point-spread-function structure of JWST imaging. Source centroids, shapes, and photometric apertures are determined using a new fast two-dimensional Gaussian regression method applied to detection-image profiles. We provide forced circular-aperture photometry, ellipsoidal Kron photometry, and curve-of-growth measurements for every source in every band. We introduce a new pixel-level regression framework to model photometric uncertainties as a function of aperture size and local mosaic properties, accounting for correlated noise in heterogeneous JWST mosaics. Photometric redshifts are computed using template-based fitting applied to both small-aperture photometry on unconvolved images and Kron photometry on common-PSF mosaics. The JADES DR5 catalogs supersede previous JADES photometric releases, and are publicly released through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes and an interactive web interface.</description>

      <title>JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Data Release 5: Catalogs of inferred morphological properties of galaxies from JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-N and GOODS-S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present morphological parameters and their uncertainties for all sources detected in JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-N and GOODS-S from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) catalogs. We model the surface brightness profiles of these sources with single-component S\'ersic profiles, performing Bayesian inference of galaxy structural parameters. We fit each of the $&gt;10^5$ sources with every available JWST/NIRCam wide-band filter individually, amounting to over 3 million S\'ersic profiles computed. We provide catalogs of this morphological information, building one of the largest extragalactic morphological datasets to date, which we share alongside imaging and photometry from the JADES Data Release 5. With this information, we analyze the rest-frame optical redshift evolution of the effective radius and the surface luminosity density within a radius of 1 kiloparsec, $\Sigma_{\text{1 kpc}}$, for 24,692 galaxies at $z&gt;1$. We find $r_{\text{eff}} \propto (1+z)^{-0.635 \pm 0.013}$ kpc, while $\Sigma_{\text{1 kpc}}$ is relatively constant across time. Additionally, we explore bulge-disk decomposition on a subset of 8,390 galaxies in the JADES deep imaging covering the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, finding the effective radius of the bulge-components to increase marginally with time, whereas the disk-component sizes evolve as $r_{\text{eff,disk}} \propto (1+z)^{-1.091 \pm 0.043}$. Future work modeling multi-component surface brightness profiles will enable further analysis of the morphological evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Data Release 5: Photometrically Selected Galaxy Candidates at z &gt; 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 2081 sources selected at photometric redshift $z_{\mathrm{phot}} &gt; 8$ across the JADES DR5 data release in GOODS-S and GOODS-N over a total area of 469 square arcmin. These sources range from $M_{\mathrm{UV}} = -22$ to $M_{\mathrm{UV}} = -16$, with 19 objects at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} &gt; 14$. We estimate the UV slopes for the full sample from fits to the photometry and find evidence for a steepening of the relationship between the UV continuum slope and $M_{\mathrm{UV}}$ to higher redshifts, a result that differs from prior analyses of brighter samples in the literature. We provide evidence that over one quarter of our sources have evidence for being morphologically extended, with many galaxies showing multiple bright knots or clumps even out to $z \sim 13 - 14$, an indication of how galaxies at Cosmic Dawn are growing and evolving. We discuss JADES-GN+189.15982+62.28899, a GOODS-N F200W dropout galaxy at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} \sim 15 - 18$ which has been observed spectroscopically with JWST/NIRSpec in prism mode, resulting in a very low signal-to-noise spectrum that is consistent with the photometry and rules out a number of low-redshift solutions for the source. Finally, we use a subsample of 123 objects in our sample with spectroscopic redshifts to explore the usage of alternate fitting templates and a prescription for Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing absorption, finding that both produce significant improvements to the estimated photometric redshifts.</description>

      <title>JADES: A Prominent Galaxy Overdensity Candidate within the First 500 Myr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a galaxy overdensity candidate at $z\approx 10.5$ in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This overdensity contains 18 galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts and robust F115W dropouts within 8 comoving Mpc in projection. The galaxy number density is four times higher than the field expectation, accounting for one-third of comparably bright galaxies and nearly 50% of the total star formation rate at $10&lt;z_\mathrm{phot}&lt;12$ in the GOODS-S field. Two compact members of the overdensity show potential Balmer breaks suggestive of evolved stellar populations or little red dots (LRDs). One-third of galaxies have close companions or substructures within 1 kpc at consistent photometric redshifts, implying more frequent interactions in an overdense environment. Most galaxies have stellar masses of 0.6-3$\times10^8$ $M_\odot$, half-light radii of $\sim$200 pc, and star formation rates of $\sim$5 $M_\odot \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, with no significant deviation from typical high-redshift scaling relations. We find tentative evidence for a spatially varying Ly$\alpha$ transmission inferred photometrically, consistent with an emerging ionized bubble. This overdensity provides a rare opportunity for probing the environmental impact on galaxy evolution and the onset of cosmic reionization within the first 500 Myr.</description>

      <title>JADES: Discovery of Large Reservoirs of Small Dust Grains in the Circumgalactic Medium of Massive Galaxies at $z\sim3.5$ through Deep JWST/NIRCam Imaging and Grism Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using JWST NIRCam imaging and grism spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Origins Fields, we report spectroscopic redshift measurements of 1,445 emission-line galaxies at $z=0-9$. Within this sample, we identify two prominent galaxy protoclusters at $z = 3.47$ and 3.69, each anchored by massive dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). In the vicinity of these systems, we discover seven background galaxies at $z=3.6 - 6$ that simultaneously exhibit strong rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g., [O III] and H$\alpha$) and unusually reddened UV-to-optical continua. We attribute this reddening to dust extinction arising from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the foreground DSFGs at projected separations of 7-30 kpc. We infer a high dust column density ($\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ Msun/kpc^2), substantially exceeding those measured in low-redshift halos and those predicted by hydrodynamical simulations like IllustrisTNG and FIRE-2. The steep extinction curves, comparable to or steeper than that of the SMC, indicate a dominant population of small dust grains in the high-redshift CGM. We conclude that DSFGs at this epoch host large reservoirs of dusty CGM enriched to solar metallicity. These extended dust components are largely invisible to (sub-)millimeter interferometers such as ALMA because of their low surface brightness. We discuss the physical processes in dust transport that might be key to reproducing our observations, including galaxy mergers, cool-phase gas outflows, dust shattering, sputtering and radiation pressure. Finally, we caution that foreground CGM dust extinction may redden background galaxies at intermediate redshifts to mimic Lyman-break galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$.</description>

      <title>Undermassive Hosts of $z = 4-6 $ AGN from JWST/NIRCam Image Decomposition with CONGRESS, FRESCO, and JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the local Universe, supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses strongly correlate with their host-galaxies' stellar masses ($M_{*}$), but galaxies hosting faint AGN recently found by JWST may deviate from this relation. To constrain the M$_{\text{BH}}$-M$_{*}$ relation at high redshift, we performed AGN-host image decomposition for 17 low-luminosity AGN galaxies at $z$\,$\sim$\,4--6 using NIRCam images in the JADES GOODS-N field. These sources are identified as AGNs from broad H$\alpha$ emission lines detected by the CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys. We used \textsc{galfit+MCMC} to fit spatial profiles in 7 wide-band images and detected extended emission in 9 sources out of 17. The close spatial alignment between the extended components and the AGN centers indicates that this emission likely originates from the host galaxies. These sources are extended at 0.9--2.0~$\mu$m, suggesting significant host-galaxy light in the rest-frame UV. For the sources with the host detection, the stellar mass inferred based on image decomposition result can be 1-2 dex lower than the results without image decomposition. The BH-to-stellar mass ratio spans $M_{\text{BH}}/M_\ast$\,$\sim$\,0.01--1.48, placing them well above the local $M_{\text{BH}}$--$M_\ast$ relation. In contrast, the host-galaxy size--mass relation broadly agrees with previous measurements. Our results suggest that the host galaxies of these faint AGN are either genuinely under-massive compared to their black hole masses, or too compact to be spatially resolved.</description>

      <title>There Is More to Outshining: 2D Dust Effects on Stellar Mass Estimates at $3 \leq z &lt; 9$ with JWST in the JADES Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust attenuation modifies the observed spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to biases in the properties inferred from integrated SED fitting. As spatially resolved SED modeling becomes feasible for large high-redshift samples, it is increasingly important to assess how dust attenuation affects resolved mass estimates. We evaluate the impact of dust attenuation on stellar mass estimates derived from integrating spatially resolved SED fitting results. We perform spatially resolved and integrated SED fitting on a sample of 3408 galaxies at $3 \leq z &lt; 9$ from the GOODS South field, combining deep NIRCam from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and HST/ACS imaging from GOODS and CANDELS. We compare galaxy-integrated properties derived from fitting the summed SED with those obtained from spatially resolved SED modeling. Using a two-component dust attenuation model with a variable slope, we investigate how the dust attenuation slope, A(V), and stellar population properties contribute to discrepancies in the resulting stellar mass estimates. Resolved stellar masses are systematically higher than integrated estimates, with a median offset of +0.24 dex. Resolved analyses recover higher dust attenuations ($\Delta A(V)\approx +0.08$ mag), lower birth cloud fractions ($\Delta\mu \approx -0.28$), and grayer attenuation curves ($\Delta\delta_{\mathrm{ISM}} = +0.08$), arising from preferential sampling of compact star-forming regions. Integrated fits underestimate stellar ages by $\sim23\%$ at $z &lt; 5$ and 31$\%$ at $z \gtrsim 5$. The stellar mass offset correlates strongly with the age difference and the attenuation slope difference, indicating that age-dependent outshining and spatially varying dust geometry are primary drivers of the discrepancy between resolved and integrated stellar masses.</description>

      <title>JADES: Evolution of nitrogen abundances in star-forming galaxies from z ~ 1.5-7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present nitrogen abundance measurements based on the low-ionisation [NII]6583 emission line for 588 galaxies between 1.5&lt;z&lt;7.0 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We detect the temperature-sensitive [OIII]4363 auroral line in 40 galaxies in our sample, affording $T_e$-based abundances for this subset. We find that the average N/O abundance ratio in our low-metallicity sample is at least 0.1 dex higher than z ~ 0 samples. In particular, we find significant scatter toward high N/O, with five galaxies being identified with enhanced nitrogen abundances (log(N/O)&gt;-1.1) at low-metallicity (12+log(O/H)&lt;8.0) from $T_e$-based measurements. Meanwhile, applying strong-line abundance measurements to the remainder of our sample reveals a further 14 candidate galaxies passing these abundance cuts, implying that around 13 % of 12+log(O/H)&lt;8.0 galaxies at these redshifts are nitrogen-enhanced at this level. We find that N/O abundance in low-metallicity systems correlates with SFR, surface density of SFR, and surface density of stellar mass at high redshift, while only in high-metallicity systems does a correlation with stellar mass emerge. Despite healthy representation of these `moderately nitrogen-enhanced' galaxies (-1.1&lt;log(N/O)&lt;-0.6), no galaxies in our low-metallicity sample are identified as having log(N/O)&gt;-0.6, abundances that are typical of high-redshift NIII]- and NIV]-emitters. This demonstrates that the extreme nitrogen enhancements seen in some NIII]- and NIV]-emitters are only attained during the most extreme starbursts. This suggests that these elevated abundances are caused by enrichment from young massive stars in extreme environments and that the impact of this enrichment pathway is milder, though still important, for high-redshift systems on the star-forming main sequence.</description>

      <title>Clump-like Structures in High-Redshift Galaxies: Mass Scaling and Radial Trends from JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive star-forming clumps are a prominent feature of high-redshift galaxies and are thought to trace gravitational fragmentation, feedback, and bulge growth in gas-rich disks. We present a statistical analysis of clump-like structures in $\sim$3600 galaxies spanning $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 8$ from deep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the JADES GOODS--South field. Clumps are identified as residual features after subtracting smooth S\'ersic profiles, enabling a uniform, rest-frame optical census of sub-galactic structure. We characterize their physical properties, size--mass relations, and spatial distributions to constrain models of sub-galactic structure formation and evolution. We find that clumps in our sample are typically low-mass ($10^{\sim7-8}M_\odot$), actively star-forming, and show diverse gas-phase metallicity, dust attenuation, and stellar population properties. Their sizes and average pairwise separations increase with cosmic time (toward lower redshift), consistent with inside-out disk growth. The clump mass function follows a power law with slope $\alpha = -1.50_{-0.17}^{+0.19}$, consistent with fragmentation in turbulent disks. We find a deficit of relatively young clumps near galaxy centers and a radial transition in the size--mass relation: outer clumps exhibit steeper, near-virial slopes ($R_{\rm e}\propto M_*^{\sim 0.3}$), while inner clumps follow flatter trends ($R_{\rm e}\propto M_*^{\sim 0.2}$), consistent with structural evolution via migration or disruption. These results provide new constraints on the formation, survival, and dynamical evolution of clumps, highlighting their role in shaping galaxy morphology during the peak of cosmic star formation.</description>

      <title>HE0144-4657: A Carbon-Enhanced Ultra Metal-Poor Star ([Fe/H] ~ -4.1) from the Helmi Stream Disrupted Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of HE0144-4657, an ultra metal-poor, CNO-enhanced star dynamically associated with the Helmi Stream disrupted dwarf-galaxy remnant. This star was first identified as a carbon-enhanced, metal-poor star candidate from the Hamburg/ESO objective-prism survey, then followed up with medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy. At [Fe/H]=-4.11, HE0144-4657 is the lowest metallicity star found in a stellar stream to date. Its chemistry is consistent with field halo stars in the same metallicity regime, and the light-element (atomic number Z&lt;=30) chemical abundance pattern suggests that HE0144-4657 is a bona-fide second-generation star with a possible Population III progenitor in the 50Msun mass range with low explosion energy. One possible scenario for the origin of HE0144-4657 is that it was formed in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy accreted by the Helmi Stream progenitor system before merging with the Milky Way. This discovery provides further evidence for the extragalactic origin of carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and for the specific environments conducive to their formation.</description>

      <title>Extreme line profile variations in the repeating changing-look active galactic nucleus IRAS23226-3843</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IRAS23226-3843 has been identified as a highly variable Seyfert galaxy and even as a changing-look active galactic nucleus based on optical spectra. Here we present follow-up observations - taken over the past five years - for examining the ongoing photometric and spectral variations in this remarkable galaxy. We carried out SWIFT observations of IRAS23226-3843 together with new optical spectra taken in 2023 and 2024. In parallel we investigate ASAS-SN photometric data from 2014 till 2025. IRAS23226-3843 stayed on a high continuum flux level in the X-ray as well as in the optical since a historic outburst in 2019. However, it shows strong short-term variations on timescales of a few months. Densely sampled ASAS-SN V-band continuum data from 2014 till 2025 confirm that behavior. IRAS23226-3843 switched from a clear Seyfert 1 type in December 2019 to a Seyfert 1.9/2 type in July 2020 based on its optical spectra. Afterward, it again became a Seyfert 1 type with symmetric broad single-peaked Balmer line profiles in January 2023. These spectra prove the repeating changing-look character of the galaxy.IRAS23226-3843 exhibits extreme high Balmer decrements Ha\Hb based on their broad line components. The Balmer decrement values are on the order of 10. IRAS23226-3843 successively showed all types of broad line Balmer profiles during the past 25 years over periods of many years: asymmetric single-peaked, double-peaked, as well as single-peaked and symmetric profiles in addition to its Seyfert 1.9/2 transition. These variations are not clearly correlated with continuum and line intensity variations.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength approach of AGN feedback in LINERs: The case of NGC 4438</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of multi-phase outflows in low ionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) has been confirmed to be frequent, but the mechanisms that launch them are still under study. We aim to explore the connections between the ionised gas outflow, radio continuum structures and X-ray emission detected in the LINER NGC4438. We analyse L, C and X-band images (from 1.4 to 12 GHz) of the LINER NGC4438, combining high-resolution data from enhanced Multi Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) and Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We produce radio flux, spectral index maps, and an energetic model that allows us to characterise the source. We incorporate optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data (GTC/MEGARA) and Chandra X-ray data, with comparable resolution, to better trace the outflow, the AGN and their potential connection. We present new L, C, and X-band high-resolution, high-sensitivity radio images and spectral-index maps that probe $\sim$ 25 pc scales in NGC 4438. These data reveal a close morphological correspondence between the radio structures and the ionised gas bubble. Using a spatially resolved energetic model based on radio flux and spectral index, we disentangle the compact AGN emission from the extended bubble for the first time, establishing their distinct physical origins. We measure a kinetic power of $\sim 5\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the radio bubble, exceeding the power of the ionised outflow by more than three orders of magnitude. Our multi-wavelength analysis indicates that NGC 4438 is undergoing jet-mode feedback, where a low-luminosity, weakly collimated jet impacts the dense northern interstellar medium. This interaction drives shock-ionised gas, produces a moderate velocity outflow that removes material from the region, and generates thermal X-ray emission coincident with the radio and H$\alpha$ cavity.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved stellar-to-total dynamical mass relation: Radial variations, gradients and profiles of galaxy stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although galaxy evolution is governed by the interplay between baryonic physics and dark matter halo assembly, how halo properties shape observed galaxies remains unclear. With current challenges in measuring halo properties, the stellar-to-total dynamical mass relation is introduced as an alternative metric sensitive to the dark matter content within galaxies. We explore how spatially resolved stellar population properties vary across this relation using optical IFS data and photometry from 265 CALIFA galaxies. Spatially resolved ages and metallicities, [M/H], are derived using a Bayesian framework fed with a library of model spectra based on stochastic star formation and metallicity histories and dust attenuation. We study these properties in terms of both stellar and total dynamical mass, with the latter being enclosed mass within three effective radii from Jeans dynamical modeling. We find that ages and [M/H] measured at different annuli depend on both stellar and total mass, yet showing distinct radial trends. While the dependence of age on total mass is more prominent in the outskirts, that of [M/H] is significant in the inner parts. This behavior is reflected in the stellar population profiles and gradients, more strongly for age and connected to morphology. Intermediate-mass early-types have higher stellar-to-total mass ratios and flatter age profiles with older ages, and steep negative [M/H] profiles, whereas later-types have lower stellar-to-total mass ratios, negative age profiles with younger ages and shallower negative [M/H] profiles. Moreover, at fixed stellar mass galaxies have more negative age gradients and shallower [M/H] ones as total mass increases. Our results show that total dynamical mass is linked to systematic variations in stellar populations and radial gradients at fixed stellar mass, suggesting a relevant role of dark matter halos in shaping galaxy properties</description>

      <title>Constraining Nuclear Molecular Gas Content with High-resolution CO Imaging of GOALS Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the cool molecular gas mass around the nuclei of two gas-rich mergers, III Zw 035 and IRAS F01364-1042, whose enclosed masses (M$_\mathrm{enc}$) within the central 40-80 pc would be overmassive if attributed entirely to the supermassive black hole mass (SMBH) and compared to SMBH-galaxy scaling relations. Our gas mass measurements are derived from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 long-baseline observations of CO(J=2-1) and 230 GHz continuum emission at 14-20 pc resolution, which probes below the resolving limit of the previous black hole mass measurements. Subtracting molecular gas mass from these enclosed masses is not enough to reconcile with BH-galaxy relationships, but independently measuring M$_\mathrm{enc}$ using the cold CO(2-1) gas does shift the black holes down to their expected values. Still, these ALMA data reveal respective molecular gas masses of $\sim$3$\times$10$^7$ to $\sim$6$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ within 70 pc of these black holes, which could challenge some black hole accretion models that assume nuclear gas like this has no angular momentum.</description>

      <title>A general spectral solver for the axisymmetric Jeans equations: fast galaxy modelling with arbitrary anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical modelling is a fundamental tool for measuring galaxy masses and density profiles in the era of large integral-field spectroscopic surveys and Bayesian inference. Solutions based on the Jeans equations are popular due to their robustness and computational efficiency. However, traditional semi-analytic Jeans solvers often require restrictive assumptions about the velocity anisotropy to remain computationally tractable. This paper presents a new spectral solver for the axisymmetric Jeans equations designed to overcome these limitations. I first illustrate, using orbit integrations in realistic potentials, that spherical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid is a physically well-motivated approximation for galaxy modelling. The new method employs a spectral technique to solve the Jeans partial differential equations directly. Two design choices are critical for accuracy and speed: (i) solving for the slowly-varying velocity dispersion rather than the rapidly varying pressure, and (ii) imposing a Robin boundary condition to enforce the asymptotic decay on a finite domain. This formulation supports arbitrary anisotropy distributions beta(r, theta) while simultaneously increasing computational speed by orders of magnitude compared to standard high-accuracy quadratures. Validated against exact analytic benchmarks, the solver recovers intrinsic moments with sub-percent accuracy. The implementation will be included in the public JamPy package and is structured to be optimally suited for massive parallelization on specialized hardware such as GPUs, enabling the rigorous exploration of complex parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Missing Red Giants near the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long-acknowledged deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter old stars within a few arc seconds of Sgr A*. We explore whether this could be due to tidal stripping by the central black hole. This requires putting the stars onto highly eccentric orbits, for which we evaluate diffusion by both scalar resonant and non-resonant relaxation of the orbital angular momentum. We conclude that tidal stripping does not discriminate sufficiently between main-sequence and red giant stars. While the tidal loss cone increases with stellar radius, the rate of diffusion into the loss cone increases only logarithmically, whereas the lifetime on the red giant branch decreases more rapidly than $R_*^{-1}$. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stellar collisions are a more likely explanation for the deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter ones.</description>

Abstract: LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, due to launch mid-2035, is a large class space mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). In partnership with NASA and ESA-member states, ESA is on track to launch what is expected to be the first space-based gravitational wave detector. By hosting detectors in space, one gains access to a lower frequency band of gravitational wave sources and with them, a plethora of new science. To maximise this scientific gain, ESA and NASA selected 20 scientists for the LISA Science Team, to carry out and/or lead necessary actions on the run up to LISA launch. We give a short overview and update of the LISA mission, some of its science objectives and related waveforms, as well as the work of the LISA Science Team as of December 2025.</description>

      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA). VII. Disk candidates around high-mass stars and evidence of anisotropic infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinematics of condensations in 30 fields forming high-mass stars with ALMA at a high-resolution of ~0.08'' on average (~230 au). The presence of disks is important for feeding high-mass stars without feedback halting growth as their masses increase. In the search for velocity gradients resembling rotation that can reveal the presence of disks, we analyze the emission of gas tracers in 49 objects using CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and tentative detections of HNCO and cis-HCOOH. Most of the velocity distributions show velocity gradients indicative of rotation. We reveal a total of 32 disk candidates, the largest sample to date that has been uniformly analyzed at a few hundred au scales in the high-mass regime. Their position-velocity maps are generally asymmetric with one side brighter than the opposite. We successfully fit a power law to the position-velocity maps of the disk candidates and find indices between -0.5 (Keplerian rotation) and -1 (rotation under specific angular momentum conservation) with a median of -0.7. Under Keplerian rotation assumption, we estimate central masses, uncorrected for inclination, ranging between 7 to 45 M$_\odot$. Excluding outliers, the disk candidates are relatively more compact (&lt;200 au) and less massive (&lt;5 M$_\odot$) than previous results at coarser angular resolution. We calculate an average Toomre-$Q$ parameter and find that most are gravitationally unstable (median of 0.5). We conclude that these observations offer the first opportunity to separate the disk and envelope components of hot cores on a statistically significant sample, and confirm that anisotropic collapse plays an role in feeding high-mass (proto)stars.</description>

      <title>Solar twins in Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec I. Building a large catalog of Solar twins with ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abbreviated] Context. Solar twins, stars whose stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [M/H]) are very close to the Solar ones, offer a unique opportunity to investigate Galactic archaeology with very high accuracy and precision. However, most previous catalogs of Solar twins contain only a small number of objects (typically a few tens), and their selection functions are poorly characterized. Aims. We aim at building a large catalog of Solar twins from Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, providing model-driven, rather than data-driven, stellar parameters including ages, together with a well-characterized selection function. Methods. Using stellar parameters from the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalog, we selected Solar-twin candidates whose parameters lie within +- 200 K in Teff, +- 0.2 in log g, and +- 0.1 dex in [M/H] of the Solar values. Candidates unlikely to be genuine Solar twins were removed using Gaia flags and photometric constraints. We determined accurate ages for individual twins with a Bayesian isochrone-projection method, considering three combinations of parameters: Teff, [M/H], and either log g, M_G, or M_Ks. We also constructed a mock catalog to characterize the selection function. Results. Our final GSP-Spec Solar-twin catalog contains 6,594 stars. The mock catalog consisting of 75,588 artificial twins well reproduces the main characteristics of the observed catalog, especially for ages determined with M_G or M_Ks. To demonstrate the usefulness of our catalog, we compared chemical abundances [X/Fe] with age. We statistically confirmed the age--[X/Fe] relations for several species (e.g., Al, Si, Ca, and Y), demonstrating that trends previously identified in small but very high-precision samples persist in a much larger, independent sample. Conclusions. Our study bridges small high-precision Solar-twin samples and large data-driven ones, enabling demographic studies of Solar twins.</description>

      <title>The age sequence of young clusters in Perseus: Estimating ages from mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing ages for young clusters is key for properly tracking the star formation history of a region. In this paper we investigate a new approach to estimating ages for young populations, based on the well-founded assumption that the initial mass function is the same throughout a star forming cloud. We trial this method for six young clusters in the Perseus star forming region. For all six clusters, we construct new member samples in a homogeneous way using Gaia DR3. We estimate masses by comparing 2MASS photometry to theoretical isochrones, including Monte Carlo simulations to propagate the errors. We compare the mass distributions of the clusters for a range of plausible ages, looking for a combination of ages that results in indistinguishable mass distributions across the region. We find the best fit for ages of 1 Myr for NGC1333+Autochthe, 2 Myr for IC348, 2-3 Myr for Heleus, 3-4 Myr for Mestor, 4-5 Myr for Electryon+Cynurus, and 5-8 Myr for Alcaeus. All other combinations of ages are ruled out by this criterion. The established age sequence is consistent with the relative ages inferred from disc fractions, and broadly aligns with the age sequence determined in previous studies using isochrone fitting. We suggest that this approach can be a useful complement and cross-check to established methods to estimate ages in young populations.</description>

      <title>Perihelion Asymmetry in the Water Production Rate of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object whose activity provides critical insights into its composition and origin. However, due to its orbital geometry, the object is too close to the Sun near perihelion to be observed from the ground, and space-based measurements are therefore required. Here we characterize the water production rate of 3I/ATLAS using SOHO/SWAN Lyman-$\alpha$ observations from 2025 November to December (heliocentric distances 1.4 to 2.2 au) with 3D Monte Carlo modeling. We report a peak post-perihelion water production rate of $Q_{\mathrm{H_2O}} \approx 4 \times 10^{28}$ mol s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a minimum active fraction of $\sim$30\% (assuming a maximum nucleus radius of 2.8 km). Comparison of our post-perihelion measurements with published pre-perihelion results reveals a heliocentric asymmetry, with an $r_h^{-5.9 \pm 0.8}$ scaling for the inbound rise, followed by a shallower $r_h^{-3.3 \pm 0.3}$ scaling during the outbound decline, where $r_h$ is heliocentric distance. The post-perihelion behavior indicates that the water production of 3I/ATLAS was driven primarily by the varying solar insolation acting on a stable active area. Combined with other evidence, including comparison with the hyperactive comet 103P/Hartley 2, our findings suggest that its water production is likely dominated by a distributed source of icy grains. Furthermore, it displayed remarkable stability in the activity with no signs of outbursts or rapid depletion of water production.</description>

      <title>Source identification for the Swift-BAT 150-month hard X-ray catalog using soft X-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive catalog of 251 potential counterparts for 250 unassociated hard X-ray sources detected in the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 150-month hard X-ray survey. Over 150 months of observation, BAT has detected 2339 sources in the 15-150 keV energy range. Among these, 344 do not have a previously identified low-energy counterpart. Our study focuses on the analysis of soft X-ray observations at energies below 10 keV, spatially overlapping with these new Swift-BAT hard X-ray sources. Such observations were taken with Chandra, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, and XMM-Newton. Within the sample of 251 potential counterparts, 94 (37 percent) are identified as active galactic nuclei and 58 (23 percent) as galaxies. The remaining 99 sources (40 percent) include pulsars, cataclysmic variables, and unclassified soft X-ray counterparts in the 0.5-10 keV band. Redshift information is available for 139 out of the 251 sources, and its distribution is in close agreement with the redshift distribution of previous BAT catalogs. We also present the results of a small optical spectroscopy campaign of 9 out of 58 galaxies. The majority of these are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies at redshifts slightly larger than the median of the BAT AGN sample.</description>

      <title>JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Data Release 5: Wisp Subtraction with the Non-negative Matrix Factorization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wisps are among the most prominent scattered light artifacts in JWST/NIRCam imaging. They often appear in certain regions of the detectors and contaminate observations at surface-brightness levels relevant for faint-source photometry. We introduce a new subtraction method that uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to model and remove wisps. Using deep NIRCam observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and other programs, we construct multi-component, filter- and detector-specific wisp templates that capture the wisp structures and their exposure-to-exposure morphological variations. Wisps in individual exposures are represented as non-negative linear combinations of these templates, consistent with their additive nature and reducing degeneracies relative to single-template scaling. Compared to existing approaches, our method delivers lower residual root mean square in wisp-affected regions and reduces photometric bias and scatter to levels consistent with clean detector areas. The NMF wisp templates are readily applicable to other datasets and are publicly released to support future NIRCam extragalactic surveys.</description>

      <title>Formation and X-ray emission from hot bubbles in planetary nebulae - III. The impact of [Wolf-Rayet]-type winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and synthetic X-ray emission of hot bubbles within planetary nebulae (PNe) driven by the powerful winds of H-deficient, [Wolf-Rayet]([WR])-type stars. Our models, based on {\sc mesa} stellar evolution tracks for 1--3 M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, adopt a recent mass-loss rate prescription for [WR] stars and incorporate the enhanced radiative cooling of their C-rich material, comparing the results against standard H-rich PN models. The enhanced mass-loss in the [WR] models leads to an accelerated post-AGB evolution and a subsequent delay in hot bubble formation compared to their H-rich counterparts, as suggested by a previous work. By computing synthetic X-ray spectra that account for the mixed H-rich and H-deficient gas phases, we find that models incorporating [WR] winds exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities ($L_\mathrm{X}$) than their H-rich counterparts, but the emissivity-weighted plasma temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas converge to values of $T_\mathrm{X} = [1-3] \times 10^{6}$~K, regardless of whether the system follows a [WR]-type or an H-rich post-AGB evolutionary path. Our results reinforce previous suggestions that mixing is a key mechanism in generating the observed soft X-ray emission even for PN hosting [WR] central stars.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dynamos in a collapsing cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields is crucial for understanding the observed magnetization of stars and galaxies. Turbulent dynamo is the primary mechanism responsible for that but the understanding of its action in a collapsing environment is still rudimentary and relies on limited numerical experiments. We develop an analytical framework and perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of small-scale and large-scale dynamos in a collapsing turbulent cloud. This approach is also applicable to expanding environments and facilitates the application of standard dynamo theory to evolving systems. Using a supercomoving formulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we demonstrate that dynamo action in a collapsing background leads to a super-exponential growth of magnetic fields in time, significantly faster than the exponential growth seen in stationary turbulence. The enhancement is mainly due to the increasing eddy turnover rate during the collapse, which boosts the instantaneous growth rate of the dynamo. We also show that the scaling of final saturated magnetic field strength with density robustly exceeds the expectation from considerations of pure flux-freezing. Apart from establishing a formal framework for studying magnetic field evolution in collapsing (or expanding) turbulent plasmas, these findings suggest that during star and galaxy formation magnetic fields can become dynamically relevant much earlier than previously thought.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: Tracing Galactic Outflows at $z\gtrsim2.5$ with JWST/NIRSpec NUV Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe galactic-scale outflows in star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim2.5$ drawn from the \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec AURORA program. For the first time, we directly compare outflow properties from the early universe to the present day using near-UV absorption lines. We measure ISM kinematics from Fe\,{\sc ii} and Mg\,{\sc ii} absorption features in 41 and 43 galaxies, respectively, and examine how these kinematics correlate with galaxy properties. We find that galaxies with outflows tend to have higher stellar masses, and that maximum outflow velocities increase with stellar mass, SFR, UV slope $\beta$, $E(B-V)$, and $A_V$. We also find that Mg\,{\sc ii} emission is more common in galaxies with lower masses, higher sSFRs, and less dust. These trends are consistent with those in star-forming galaxies at $z&lt;2$ when using the same outflow tracers, suggesting that the feedback from star formation has played a persistent role in shaping galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We also directly compare near-UV and far-UV features in the same NIRSpec spectrum for a $z=5.19$ galaxy, finding consistent ISM kinematics and demonstrating that different tracers yield comparable measurements. We also detect Na\,D absorption in 10 galaxies, which have higher stellar mass, SFR, and dust attenuation compared to galaxies without Na\,D absorption, which is consistent with $z\sim0$ studies. The broad continuum coverage and sensitivity of NIRSpec will enable future studies with larger samples, allowing for robust tests of these trends across a wider dynamic range of galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Bars in low-density environments rotate faster than bars in dense regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does the environment of a galaxy directly influence the kinematics of its bar? We present observational evidence that bars in high-density environments exhibit significantly slower rotation rates than bars in low-density environments. Galactic bars are central, extended structures composed of stars, dust and gas, present in approximately 30 to 70 per cent of luminous spiral galaxies in the local Universe. Recent simulation studies have suggested that the environment can influence the bar rotation rate, $R$, which is used to classify bars as either fast ($1\leq R \leq1.4$) or slow ($R \gt 1.4$). We use estimates of $R$ obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from MaNGA and CALIFA. After cross-matching these with the projected neighbour density, $\log\Sigma$, we retain 286 galaxies. The analysis reveals that bars in high-density environments are significantly slower (median $R = 1.65^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$) compared to bars in low-density environments (median $R = 1.39^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$); Anderson-Darling $\textit{p}$-value of $p_{\mathrm{AD}}= 0.002$ ($3.1\,\sigma$). This study marks the first empirical test of the hypothesis that fast bars are formed by global instabilities in isolated galaxies, while slow bars are triggered by tidal interactions in dense environments, in agreement with predictions from numerous $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Future studies would benefit from a larger sample of galaxies with reliable Integral Field Unit data, required to measure bar rotation rates. Specifically, more data are necessary to study the environmental influence on bar formation within dense settings (i.e. groups, clusters and filaments).</description>

      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA. VI. The Formation of Low-mass Multiple Systems in High-mass Cluster-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most stars form in multiple systems, with profound implications in numerous astronomical phenomena intrinsically linked to multiplicity. However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (&gt;8 M$_{\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases. We propose that in the extremely dense environments where high-mass stars form, dynamical interactions play an important role in disrupting weakly bound systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonant scattering of He I 1.0833$\mu$m triplet photons by metastable He 2 $^3$S$_1$ is studied for optical depths characteristic of H II regions. Regions with large He 2 $^3$S$_1$ column densities are predicted to have unusually broad, multi-peaked 1.0833$\mu$m emission profiles, with the centroid blue-shifted by up to $\sim$14 km/s relative to other lines. The feature FWHM can exceed 100 km/s for some regions. Resonant trapping enhances dust absorption and reduces the He I 1.0833$\mu$m emission. Care must be taken when using the He I 1.0833$\mu$m/H I 1.0941$\mu$m (Pa$\gamma$) ratio to estimate the He$^+$/H$^+$ ratio. Predicted spectra are computed for examples, including M-17B and NGC3603 in the Galaxy, and a star-forming region in M51. Observations of the 1.0833$\mu$m triplet with spectrometers such as NIRSPEC, CARMENES, or X-Shooter can confirm the predicted effects of resonant scattering in H II regions, and constrain the nebular conditions.</description>

      <title>Updated Metallicity Diagnostics for Precision Oxygen Abundance Measurements in High-redshift Galaxies with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that widely used strong-line oxygen abundance indicators, such as O3N2, $\rm R23$, and $\widehat{\rm R}$, suffer from large uncertainties when applied to high-redshift galaxies. We show that this loss of precision primarily arises because, at fixed \Oabund, galaxies span a wide dynamic range in ionization parameter and nitrogen enrichment. Here we develop updated indicators that explicitly incorporate both effects via the proxies O32 and N2O2. We define ${\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm R23+\alpha_1 O32+\alpha_2 N2O2$, $\widehat{\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm \widehat{R}+\beta_1 O32+\beta_2 N2O2$, and ${\rm O}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm O3N2+\gamma_1 O32+\gamma_2 N2O2$, and calibrate \Oabund~as low-order polynomials in each composite indicator. Applied to a JWST sample with $T_{\rm e}$-method abundances, the updated indicators substantially tighten the correlations with \Oabund, boosting adjusted coefficients of determination from $\mathbb{R}^2\lesssim 0$ (classical indicators) to $\mathbb{R}^2\gtrsim 0.5$ for the full sample and to $\sim 0.7$ at $z&gt;2$. The residuals reveal a redshift evolution in the mapping between \Oabund, strong lines, ionization, and nitrogen enrichment, with a pivotal turning point near the cosmic noon ($z\sim 2$). Our calibrations provide a practical, physically grounded path to precise metallicity measurements in the JWST era and a firmer basis for quantifying early chemical enrichment and feedback.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavily Obscured AGN in Major Galaxy Mergers Using the mm-X-ray Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of heavily obscured supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in late-stage galaxy mergers is challenging: column densities $N_{\mathrm{H}}&gt;10^{24},\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ can block most nuclear emission, leaving significant gaps in the SMBH growth census. Millimeter-wave continuum emission offers a potential window into this obscured phase, as it can trace Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity through mechanisms less affected by dust extinction. In this work, we test whether the observed correlation between millimeter ($\sim200,\mathrm{GHz}$) and hard X-ray (14 - 150,keV) luminosities can be used to plausibly identify hidden AGN in local (Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies (U)LIRGs, including systems hosting confirmed dual AGN. We identify three sources -- one confirmed AGN and two strong candidates -- presenting significant evidence of AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN lie within $\sim3\sigma$ of the mm--X-ray correlation, suggesting this relation can be used to identify hidden pairs. By combining the position of each source relative to this correlation with independent star formation rate constraints, we propose a method to disentangle AGN and star formation contributions for sources with measured column densities. While our analysis is based on a small, heterogeneous local sample and relies on empirical scaling relations, these results indicate that millimeter continuum emission may provide a useful complementary diagnostic for obscured SMBH growth. ALMA observations at high angular resolutions are particularly valuable for this approach, while future facilities such as the ngVLA will be essential to test its robustness in larger and more distant samples.</description>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i &lt; 19.2) at z &lt; 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z &lt; 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Multi-color characterization of optically invisible FU Orionis-type outbursts: Demonstration and prospects for the WINTER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04560</link>

Abstract: Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the proto-stellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on i) their proximity to star-forming regions, ii) large amplitude (2-4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and iv) "mixed-temperature" infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor which we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits $\gtrsim 100\times$ fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object (YSO) outbursts. We highlight the capabilities of the Galactic Plane survey of the recently commissioned WINTER observatory in addressing the poorly understood FUor population with its unique combination of real-time detection capabilities, multi-color sensitivity, weekly cadence, and wide area coverage.</description>
