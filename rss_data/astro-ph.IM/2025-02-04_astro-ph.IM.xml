      <title>Pulsar timing and polarimetry: results and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing, i.e. the analysis of the arrival times of pulses from a pulsar, is a powerful tool in modern astrophysics. It allows us to measure the time delays of an electromagnetic signal caused by a number of physical processes as the signal propagates from the source to the observer. Joint analysis of an ensemble of pulsars (Pulsar Timing Arrays, PTAs) can be used to address a variety of astrophysical challenges, including the problem of direct detection of space-time metric perturbations, in particular those induced by gravitational waves. Here we present a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the field of pulsar timing, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in the detection of stochastic background of nHz gravitational waves, reported by a number of international collaborations such as NANOGrav (North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves), European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA), which are joining their efforts within the International PTA (IPTA). Additionally, this paper reviews contemporary constraints on scalar ultralight matter (pseudoscalar bosons), obtained from timing and polarimetry data of pulsars. The prospects for applying these tools to other problems in fundamental physics and cosmology are explored.</description>

      <title>Million Points of Light (MPoL): a PyTorch library for radio interferometric imaging and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical radio interferometers achieve exquisite angular resolution by cross-correlating signal from a cosmic source simultaneously observed by distant pairs of radio telescopes to produce a Fourier-type measurement called a visibility. Million Points of Light (MPoL) is a Python library supporting feed-forward modeling of interferometric visibility datasets for synthesis imaging and parametric Bayesian inference, built using the autodifferentiable machine learning framework PyTorch. Neural network components provide a rich set of modular and composable building blocks that can be used to express the physical relationships between latent model parameters and observed data following the radio interferometric measurement equation. Industry-grade optimizers make it straightforward to simultaneously solve for the synthesized image and calibration parameters using stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Teledyne COSMOS Camera: A Large Format CMOS Image Sensor for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Teledyne COSMOS-66 is a next-generation CMOS camera designed for astronomical imaging, featuring a large-format sensor ($8120 \times 8120$ pixels, each $10 \mu m$), high quantum efficiency, high frame rates, and a correlated multi-sampling mode that achieves low read noise. We performed a suite of bench-top and on-sky tests to characterize this sensor and analyze its suitability for use in astronomical instruments. This paper presents measurements of linearity, conversion gain, read noise, dark current, quantum efficiency, image lag, and crosstalk. We found that the sensor exhibits nonlinear response below 5% of saturation. This nonlinearity is plausibly attributable to the trapping of electrons in each pixel. We developed and implemented a pixel-by-pixel nonlinearity correction, enabling accurate photometric measurements across the dynamic range. After implementing this correction, operating in the correlated multi-sampling mode, the sensor achieved an effective read noise of $2.9 e^-$ and dark current of $0.12 e^-/pix/s$ at $-25^\circ C$. The quantum efficiency exceeded 50% from 250 nm to 800 nm, peaking at 89% at 600 nm. We observed significant optical crosstalk between the pixels, likely caused by photoelectron diffusion. To demonstrate the sensor's astronomical performance, we mounted it on the WINTER 1m telescope at Palomar Observatory. These tests confirmed that the linearity calibration enables accurate stellar photometry and validated our measured noise levels. Overall, the COSMOS-66 delivers similar noise performance to large-format CCDs, with higher frame rates and relaxed cooling requirements. If pixel design improvements are made to mitigate the nonlinearity and crosstalk, then the camera may combine the advantages of low-noise CMOS image sensors with the integration simplicity of large-format CCDs, broadening its utility to a host of astronomical science cases.</description>

      <title>TABASCAL II: Removing Multi-Satellite Interference from Point-Source Radio Astronomy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first TABASCAL paper we showed how to calibrate in the presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources by simultaneously isolating the trajectories and signals of the RFI sources. Here we show that we can accurately remove RFI from simulated MeerKAT radio interferometry target data, for a single frequency channel, corrupted by up to 9 simultaneous satellites with average RFI amplitudes varying from weak to very strong (1 - 1000 Jy). Additionally, TABASCAL also manages to leverage the RFI signal-to-noise to phase calibrate the recovered astronomical signal. TABASCAL effectively performs a suitably phased up fringe filter for each RFI source which allows essentially perfect removal of RFI across all strengths. As a result, TABASCAL reaches image noises equivalent to the uncorrupted, no-RFI, case. Consequently, point-source science with TABASCAL almost matches the no-RFI case with near perfect completeness for all RFI amplitudes. In contrast the completeness of AOFlagger and idealised 3$\sigma$ flagging drops below 40% for strong RFI amplitudes where recovered flux errors are $\sim$10x-100x worse than those from TABASCAL. Finally we highlight that TABASCAL works for both static and varying astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Multi-Rate DSP for Sub-mm Astronomy: Polyphase Synthesis Filter Bank on FPGA for Enhanced MKID Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation mm/sub-mm/far-IR astronomy will in part be enabled by advanced digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. The Prime-Cam instrument of the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), featuring the largest array of submillimeter detectors to date, utilizes a novel overlap-channel polyphase synthesis filter bank (OC-PSB) for the AC biasing of detectors, implemented on a cutting-edge Xilinx Radio Frequency System on Chip (RFSoC). This design departs from traditional waveform look-up-table(LUT) in memory, allowing real-time, dynamic signal generation, enhancing usable bandwidth and dynamic range, and enabling microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) tracking for future readout systems. Results show that the OC-PSB upholds critical performance metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while offering additional benefits such as scalability. This paper will discuss DSP design, RFSoC implementation, and laboratory performance, demonstrating OC-PSB's potential in submillimeter-wave astronomy MKID readout systems.</description>

      <title>A Fast Periodicity Detection Algorithm Sensitive to Arbitrary Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reexamination of period finding algorithms is prompted by new large area astronomical sky surveys that can identify billions of individual sources having a thousand or more observations per source. This large increase in data necessitates fast and efficient period detection algorithms. In this paper, we provide an initial description of an algorithm that is being used for detection of periodic behavior in a sample of 1.5 billion objects using light curves generated from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data (Bellm et al. 2019; Masci et al. 2018). We call this algorithm "Fast Periodicity Weighting" (FPW), derived using a Gaussian Process (GP) formalism. A major advantage of the FPW algorithm for ZTF analysis is that it is agnostic to the details of the phase-folded waveform. Periodic sources in ZTF show a wide variety of waveforms, some quite complex, including eclipsing objects, sinusoidally varying objects also exhibiting eclipses, objects with cyclotron emission at various phases, and accreting objects with complex waveforms. We describe the FPW algorithm and its application to ZTF, and provide efficient code for both CPU and GPU.</description>

      <title>GWSkyNet-Multi II: an updated deep learning model for rapid classification of gravitational-wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a deep learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II, an updated model targeted towards providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star-black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values, making it more interpretable. For significant O4 event alerts issued between May 2023 and December 2024, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.</description>

      <title>PyLMT: A transient detection pipeline for the 4-m International Liquid Mirror Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-m aperture, zenith-pointing telescope with a field-of-view of 22', situated in the foothills of the Himalayas. The telescope operates in continuous survey mode, making it a useful instrument for time-domain astronomy, particularly for detecting transients, variable stars, active galactic nuclei variability, and asteroids. This paper presents the PyLMT transient detection pipeline to detect such transient/varying sources in the ILMT images. The pipeline utilises the image subtraction technique to compare a pair of images from the same field, identifying such sources in subtracted images with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN) based real/bogus classifiers. The test accuracies determined for the real/bogus classifiers ranged from 94% to 98%. The resulting precision of the pipeline calculated over candidate alerts in the ILMT frames is 0.91. It also houses a CNN-aided transient candidate classifier that classifies the transient/variable candidates based on host morphology. The test accuracy of the candidate classifier is 98.6%. It has the provision to identify catalogued asteroids and other solar system objects using public databases. The median execution time of the pipeline is approximately 29 minutes per image of 17 minutes exposure. Relevant CNNs have been trained on data acquired with the ILMT during the cycle of October-November 2022. Subsequent tests on those images have confirmed the detection of numerous catalogued asteroids, variable stars, and other uncatalogued sources. The pipeline has been operational and has detected 12 extragalactic transients, including 2 new discoveries in the November 2023-May 2024 observation cycle.</description>

      <title>The 4m International Liquid Mirror Telescope: Construction, operation, and science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) project was motivated by the need for an inexpensive 4 metre diameter optical telescope that could be devoted entirely to astronomical surveys. Its scientific programmes include the detection and study of transients, variable objects, asteroids, comets, space debris and low surface brightness galaxies. To this end, a collaboration was formed between the Institute of Astrophysics and Geophysics (Li\`ege University, Belgium), several Canadian universities (University of British Columbia, Laval University, University of Montreal, University of Toronto, York University, University of Victoria) and the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES, India). After several years of design work in Belgium and construction in India on the ARIES Devasthal site, the telescope saw its first light on 29 April 2022. Its commissioning phase lasted from May 2022 until June 2023 (beginning of the monsoon). The ILMT was inaugurated on 21 March 2023 and has been in regular operation since October 2023. The telescope continuously observes the sky passing at the zenith using the SDSS g', r', and i' filters. This paper describes the ILMT, its operation, performance and shows some initial results.</description>

      <title>MauveSim: the instrument simulator software for the Mauve mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MauveSim, the instrument simulator software for Mauve, the latest mission from Blue Skies Space dedicated to time-domain stellar astronomy. The tool is designed to generate simulated stellar spectra, enabling the assessment of various scientific objectives, as well as determining limiting magnitudes and conducting signal-to-noise (S/N) analyses. MauveSim functions as an end-to-end simulator that takes an input stellar spectrum-either observed or synthetic-and produces a simulated observation based on the instrument's performance and characteristics. The results of MauveSim have been validated against instrument performance data from extensive ground testing campaigns, ensuring that the software reflects the most up-to-date understanding of the payload performance. Accessible to all scientists involved in the mission, MauveSim serves as a crucial tool for target selection and observation planning.</description>

      <title>Gamma/hadron separation in the TAIGA experiment with neural network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the ability of rare VHE gamma ray selection with neural network methods is investigated in the case when cosmic radiation flux strongly prevails (ratio up to {10^4} over the gamma radiation flux from a point source). This ratio is valid for the Crab Nebula in the TeV energy range, since the Crab is a well-studied source for calibration and test of various methods and installations in gamma astronomy. The part of TAIGA experiment which includes three Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes observes this gamma-source too. Cherenkov telescopes obtain images of Extensive Air Showers. Hillas parameters can be used to analyse images in standard processing method, or images can be processed with convolutional neural networks. In this work we would like to describe the main steps and results obtained in the gamma/hadron separation task from the Crab Nebula with neural network methods. The results obtained are compared with standard processing method applied in the TAIGA collaboration and using Hillas parameter cuts. It is demonstrated that a signal was received at the level of higher than 5.5{\sigma} in 21 hours of Crab Nebula observations after processing the experimental data with the neural network method.</description>

      <title>Towards a robust model-independent test of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal: ANAIS-112 results with six years of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter, which constitutes 27% of the Universe's matter-energy content, remains one of the most challenging open questions in physics. Over the past two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has reported an annual modulation in the detection rate of $\approx$250 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors operated at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which the collaboration interprets as evidence of the galactic dark matter detection. However, this claim has not been independently confirmed and is refuted under certain dark matter particle and halo model scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to perform an experiment with the same target material. The ANAIS experiment uses 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory and it has been collecting data since August 2017 to model-independently test the DAMA/LIBRA result. This article presents the results of the annual modulation analysis corresponding to six years of ANAIS-112 data. Our results, the most sensitive to date with the same target material, NaI(Tl), are incompatible with the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal at a 4$\sigma$ confidence level. Such a discrepancy strongly challenges the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter interpretation and highlights the need to address systematic uncertainties affecting the comparison, particularly those related to the response of detectors to nuclear recoils, which may require further characterization of the DAMA crystals.</description>

Abstract: X-ray observing facilities, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the eROSITA, have detected millions of astronomical sources associated with high-energy phenomena. The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.</description>

      <title>Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</description>

      <title>BatAnalysis -- A Comprehensive Python Pipeline for Swift BAT Time-Tagged Event Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a coded aperture gamma-ray instrument with a large field of view that was designed to detect and localize transient events. When a transient is detected, either on-board or externally, the BAT saves time-tagged event (TTE) data which provides the highest quality information of the locations of the photons on the detector plane and their energies. This data can be used to produce spectra, lightcurves, and sky images of a transient event. While these data products are produced by the Swift Data Center and can be produced by current software, they are often preset to certain time and energy intervals which has limited their use in the current time domain and multi-messenger environment. Here, we introduce a new capability for the BatAnalysis python package to download and process TTE data under an open-source pythonic framework that allows for easy interfacing with other python packages. The new capabilities of the BatAnalysis software allows for TTE data to be used by the community in a variety of advanced customized analyses of astrophysical sources which BAT may have TTE data for, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB), Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters, magnetars, and many other sources. We highlight the usefulness of the BatAnalysis package in analyzing TTE data produced by an on-board GRB trigger, a FRB external trigger, a sub-threshold detection of the LMXB EXO 0748-676, and an external trigger of a GRB that BAT detected during a slew.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation from Gamma-ray Burst rest-frame spectral lags using Profile Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze the spectral lag data for 56 GRBs in the cosmological rest frame to search for Lorentz Invariance Violation using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use the technique of profile likelihood to deal with the nuisance parameters corresponding to a constant astrophysical spectral lag in the GRB rest frame and the unknown intrinsic scatter, while the parameter of interest is the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) for LIV. With this method, we do not obtain a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ up to the Planck scale. Therefore, we can set one-sided lower limits on $E_{QG}$ in a seamless manner. The 95% c.l. lower limits which we obtain on $E_{QG}$ are then given by $E_{QG}\geq 1.22 \times 10^{15}$ GeV and $E_{QG}\geq 6.64\times 10^{5}$ GeV, for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this work represents yet another proof of principles application of profile likelihood in the search for LIV using GRB spectral lags.</description>

      <title>A $\chi^2$ statistic for the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by stellar mass compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and lensed by galaxy- or cluster-scale lenses, will produce two or more copies of the GW signal. These will have identical phase evolution but differing amplitudes. Such lensing signatures are expected to be detected by the end of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra's (LVK's) fifth observing run (O5). In this work, we propose a novel $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ statistic to segregate pairs of detected GW events as either lensed or unlensed, using templates typically used in GW searches. The statistic is an application of the generalized $\chi^2$ discriminator described in \citet{dhurandhar2017}, tailored to probe the similarity (or lack thereof) between the phase evolutions of two CBC signals. We assess the performance of $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ on a realistic astrophysical dataset of lensed and unlensed CBCs detectable in O4, assuming a single LIGO-like detector at design sensitivity. We find that we can correctly identify lensed events with efficiencies comparable to existing Bayesian and machine learning methods. Evaluating $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ is orders of magnitude faster than Bayesian methods. Moreover, the statistics of $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$, in stationary Gaussian noise, are fully understood, in contrast to machine learning methods. $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ can, therefore, be used to rapidly and accurately weed out the vast majority of unlensed candidate pairs and identify lensed pairs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological super-resolution of the 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we train score-based diffusion models to super-resolve gigaparsec-scale cosmological simulations of the 21-cm signal. We examine the impact of network and training dataset size on model performance, demonstrating that a single simulation is sufficient for a model to learn the super-resolution task regardless of the initial conditions. Our best-performing model achieves pixelwise $\mathrm{RMSE}\sim0.57\ \mathrm{mK}$ and dimensionless power spectrum residuals ranging from $10^{-2}-10^{-1}\ \mathrm{mK^2}$ for $128^3$, $256^3$ and $512^3$ voxel simulation volumes at redshift $10$. The super-resolution network ultimately allows us to utilize all spatial scales covered by the SKA1-Low instrument, and could in future be employed to help constrain the astrophysics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A practical Bayesian method for gravitational-wave ringdown analysis with multiple modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) ringdown signals from black holes (BHs) encode crucial information about the gravitational dynamics in the strong-field regime, which offers unique insights into BH properties. In the future, the improving sensitivity of GW detectors is to enable the extraction of multiple quasi-normal modes (QNMs) from ringdown signals. However, incorporating multiple modes drastically enlarges the parameter space, posing computational challenges to data analysis. Inspired by the $F$-statistic method in the continuous GW searches, we develope an algorithm, dubbed as FIREFLY, for accelerating the ringdown signal analysis. FIREFLY analytically marginalizes the amplitude and phase parameters of QNMs to reduce the computational cost and speed up the full-parameter inference from hours to minutes, while achieving consistent posterior and evidence. The acceleration becomes more significant when more QNMs are considered. Rigorously based on the principle of Bayesian inference and importance sampling, our method is statistically interpretable, flexible in prior choice, and compatible with various advanced sampling techniques, providing a new perspective for accelerating future GW data analysis.</description>

      <title>LearningMatch: Siamese Neural Network Learns the Match Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The match, which is defined as the the similarity between two waveform templates, is a fundamental calculation in computationally expensive gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines, such as template bank generation. In this paper we introduce LearningMatch, a Siamese neural network that has learned the mapping between the parameters, specifically $\lambda_{0}$ (which is proportional to the chirp mass), $\eta$ (symmetric mass ratio), and equal aligned spin ($\chi_{1}$ = $\chi_{2}$), of two gravitational-wave templates and the match. The trained Siamese neural network, called LearningMatch, can predict the match to within $3.3\%$ of the actual match value. For match values greater than 0.95, a trained LearningMatch model can predict the match to within $1\%$ of the actual match value. LearningMatch can predict the match in 20 $\mu$s (mean maximum value) with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). LearningMatch is 3 orders of magnitudes faster at determining the match than current standard mathematical calculations that involve the template being generated.</description>

      <title>Forced Measurement of Astronomical Sources at Low Signal to Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified moment matching algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures for sources with a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The proposed modifications include a method to eliminate non-physical negative pixel values and a forced single iteration with an initial guess derived from co-add measurements when iterative methods are unstable. We correct for all biases in measurements introduced by the method. We find that the proposed modifications allow the algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures in nearly 100\% of the cases, especially at low signal to noise ratio. Additionally, with a reasonable guess from co-add measurements, the algorithm measures the flux, centroid, size, shape and ellipticity with bias statistically consistent with zero. We show the proposed method allows us to measure sources seven times fainter than traditional methods when applied to images obtained from WIYN-ODI. We also present a scheme to find uncertainties in measurements when using the new method to measure astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>Correcting Turbulence-induced Errors in Fiber Positioning for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly-multiplexed, robotic, fiber-fed spectroscopic surveys are observing tens of millions of stars and galaxies. For many systems, accurate positioning relies on imaging the fibers in the focal plane and feeding that information back to the robotic positioners to correct their positions. Inhomogeneities and turbulence in the air between the focal plane and the imaging camera can affect the measured positions of fibers, limiting the accuracy with which fibers can be placed on targets. For the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, we dramatically reduced the effect of turbulence on measurements of positioner locations in the focal plane by taking advantage of stationary positioners and the correlation function of the turbulence. We were able to reduce positioning errors from 7.3 microns to 3.5 microns, speeding the survey by 1.6% under typical conditions.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical search method for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-based detector data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future space-based laser interferometric detectors, such as LISA, will be able to detect gravitational waves (GWs) generated during the inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes (SmBBHs). The detection and characterization of GWs from SmBBHs poses a formidable data analysis challenge, arising from the large number of wave cycles that make the search extremely sensitive to mismatches in signal and template parameters in a likelihood-based approach. This makes the search for the maximum of the likelihood function over the signal parameter space an extremely difficult task. We present a data analysis method that addresses this problem using both algorithmic innovations and hardware acceleration driven by GPUs. The method follows a hierarchical approach in which a semi-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic is computed with different numbers of frequency domain partitions at different stages, with multiple particle swarm optimization (PSO) runs used in each stage for global optimization. An important step in the method is the judicious partitioning of the parameter space at each stage to improve the convergence probability of PSO and avoid premature convergence to noise-induced secondary maxima. The hierarchy of stages confines the semi-coherent searches to progressively smaller parameter ranges, with the final stage performing a search for the global maximum of the fully-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We test our method on 2.5 years of a single LISA TDI combination and find that for an injected SmBBH signal with a SNR between $\approx 11$ and $\approx 14$, the method can estimate (i) the chirp mass with a relative error of $\lesssim 0.01\%$, (ii) the time of coalescence within $\approx 100$ sec, (iii) the sky location within $\approx 0.2$ ${\rm deg}^2$, and (iv) orbital eccentricity at a fiducial signal frequency of 10 mHz with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$.

      <description>arXiv:2410.06430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) remain a critical focus in the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in modern astronomy. Their detection and subsequent analysis will enhance our understanding of the explosion mechanisms in massive stars. This paper investigates a combination of time-frequency analysis tools with convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection of GWs originating from CCSNe. The CNN was trained on simulated CCSNe signals and Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) noise in two instances, using spectrograms computed from two time-frequency transformations: the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the Q-transform. The algorithm detects CCSNe signals based on their time-frequency spectrograms. Our CNN model achieves a near 100% true positive rate for CCSNe GW events with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 0.5 in our test set. We also found that the STFT outperforms the Q-transform for SNRs below 0.5.</description>

      <title>Post-processing subtraction of tilt-to-length noise in LISA in the presence of gravitational wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory. It will measure gravitational wave signals in the frequency regime from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. The success of these measurements will depend on the suppression of the various instrument noises. One important noise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. Here, it is understood as the coupling of angular jitter, predominantly from the spacecraft, into the interferometric length readout. The current plan is to subtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise minimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the GW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly modeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will not degrade the GW signals. In the present manuscript, we show on simulated LISA data and for four different GW signal types that the GW responses have little effect on the quality of the TTL coupling fit and subtraction. Also, the GW signal characteristics were not altered by the TTL coupling subtraction.</description>

      <title>Mining the time axis with TRON. I. Millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri, Terzan 5 and 47 Tucanae detected through MeerKAT interferometric imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.</description>

      <title>TRIPP: A General Purpose Data Pipeline for Astronomical Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the TRansient Image Processing Pipeline (TRIPP), a transient and variable source detection pipeline that employs both difference imaging and light curve analysis techniques for astronomical data. Additionally, we demonstrate TRIPP's rapid analysis capability by detecting transient candidates in near-real time. TRIPP was tested using image data of the supernova SN2023ixf and from the Local Galactic Transient Survey (LGTS, Thomas et al. (2025)) collected by the Las Cumbres Observatory's (LCO) network of 0.4 m telescopes. To verify the methods employed by TRIPP, we compare our results to published findings on the photometry of SN2023ixf. Additionally, we report the ability of TRIPP to detect transient signals from optical Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) sources.</description>

      <title>Dealing with data gaps for TianQin with massive black hole binary signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin might encounter data gaps due to factors like micrometeoroid collisions or hardware failures. Such events will cause discontinuity in the data, presenting challenges to the data analysis for TianQin, especially for massive black hole binary mergers. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) accumulates in a non-linear way, a gap near the merger could lead to a significant loss of SNR. It could introduce bias in the estimate of noise properties, and the results of the parameter estimation. In this work, using simulated TianQin data with injected a massive black hole binary merger, we study the window function method, and for the first time, the inpainting method to cope with the data gap, and an iterative estimate scheme is designed to properly estimate the noise spectrum. We find that both methods can properly estimate noise and signal parameters. The easy-to-implement window function method can already perform well, except that it will sacrifice some SNR due to the adoption of the window. The inpainting method is slower, but it can minimize the impact of the data gap.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: Angular galaxy clustering from deep surveys with complex selection effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photometric galaxy surveys, despite their limited resolution along the line of sight, encode rich information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe thanks to the high number density and extensive depth of the data. However, the complicated selection effects in wide and deep surveys can potentially cause significant bias in the angular two-point correlation function (2PCF) measured from those surveys. In this paper, we measure the 2PCF from the newly published KiDS-Legacy sample. Given an $r$-band $5\sigma$ magnitude limit of $24.8$ and survey footprint of $1347$ deg$^2$, it achieves an excellent combination of sky coverage and depth for such a measurement. We find that complex selection effects, primarily induced by varying seeing, introduce over-estimation of the 2PCF by approximately an order of magnitude. To correct for such effects, we apply a machine learning-based method to recover an organised random (OR) that presents the same selection pattern as the galaxy sample. The basic idea is to find the selection-induced clustering of galaxies using a combination of self-organising maps (SOMs) and hierarchical clustering (HC). This unsupervised machine learning method is able to recover complicated selection effects without specifying their functional forms. We validate this SOM+HC method on mock deep galaxy samples with realistic systematics and selections derived from the KiDS-Legacy catalogue. Using mock data, we demonstrate that the OR delivers unbiased 2PCF cosmological parameter constraints, removing the $27\sigma$ offset in the galaxy bias parameter that is recovered when adopting uniform randoms. Blinded measurements on the real KiDS-Legacy data show that the corrected 2PCF is robust to the SOM+HC configuration near the optimal set-up suggested by the mock tests.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>

      <title>Filling the gap in the IERS C01 polar motion series in 1858.9-1860.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The C01 Earth orientation parameters (EOP) series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is the longest reliable record of the Earth's rotation. In particular, the polar motion (PM) series beginning from 1846 provides a basis for investigation of the long-term PM variations. However, the pole coordinate $Y_p$ in the IERS C01 PM series has a 2-year gap, which makes this series not completely evenly spaced. This paper presents the results of the first attempt to overcome this problem and discusses some ways to fill this gap. Two novel approaches were considered for this purpose: parametric astronomical model consisting of the bias and the Chandler and annual wobbles with linearly changing amplitudes, and data-driven model based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Both methods were tested with various options to ensure robust and reliable results. The results obtained by the two methods generally agree within the $Y_p$ errors in the IERS C01 series, but the results obtained by the SSA approach can be considered preferable because it is based on a more complete PM model.</description>

      <title>Mass of particles released by comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during 2023-2024 outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During its most recent return, comet 12P/Pons-Brooks experienced 14 well-documented outbursts, observed between June 13, 2023, and April 2024, at heliocentric distances ranging from $4.26\,$au to $0.85\,$au. After perihelion, two additional outbursts were observed in summer 2024, at heliocentric distances of $1.20\,$au and $2.26\,$au. Using observational data, we developed a numerical model to estimate the mass ejected during these events, focusing on the sublimation of ice through the porous cometary nucleus. The key factors affecting ejected mass estimates are the outburst amplitude and the active surface area during both quiet sublimation and the outburst phases. Pogson's law was used to express outburst magnitude, incorporating scattering cross-sections of cometary agglomerates. The model iteratively determined the mass ejected in observed outbursts, considering various ice types (H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$) controlling sublimation activity. Our results indicate that the mass ejected during these outbursts ranged from 10$^{10}$ to 10$^{13}$ kg. Our findings highlight the significant role of surface morphology and thermodynamic conditions in cometary outbursts, providing insights into the mechanisms driving these phenomena and their implications for cometary evolution and dust trail formation. Based on the analysis of observational data, we propose a six-level classification scheme for cometary outbursts.</description>
