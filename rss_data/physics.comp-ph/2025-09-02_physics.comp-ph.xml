      <title>AFSI: Automated Fluid-Structure Interaction Solver Development for Nonlinear Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AFSI is a novel, open-source fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver
  that extends the capabilities of the FEniCS finite element library through
  an immersed boundary (IB) framework. Designed to simulate large deformations
  in hyperelastic materials (such as cardiac tissue), AFSI avoids the need for expensive remeshing by coupling a Lagrangian representation of the solid with an Eulerian description of the surrounding fluid. This approach retains the full expressiveness of FEniCS's variational formulations, function spaces, and time integration schemes.
  Implemented in a hybrid Python/C++ architecture, AFSI allows users to define geometries, constitutive models (e.g., the Holzapfel-Ogden law for myocardium), and strain energy functions directly in Python, while delegating performance-critical tasks such as assembly and linear solvers to optimized C++ backends. Its concise and modular Python API facilitates the setup of FSI simulations, enabling users to easily modify discretization strategies or analyze results using standard FEniCS post-processing tools.
  By combining the flexibility of FEniCS with a robust immersed boundary formulation, AFSI empowers rapid prototyping of complex nonlinear solid-fluid interaction problems, making it a powerful tool for simulating biomechanical systems and other applications involving highly deformable structures in flow.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Memorization in Autoregressive Deep Learning: Or, Examining Temporal Decay of Gradient Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models trained as autoregressive PDE surrogates hold significant promise for accelerating scientific discovery through their capacity to both extrapolate beyond training regimes and efficiently adapt to downstream tasks despite a paucity of examples for fine-tuning. However, reliably achieving genuine generalization - a necessary capability for producing novel scientific insights and robustly performing during deployment - remains a critical challenge. Establishing whether or not these requirements are met demands evaluation metrics capable of clearly distinguishing genuine model generalization from mere memorization.
  We apply the influence function formalism to systematically characterize how autoregressive PDE surrogates assimilate and propagate information derived from diverse physical scenarios, revealing fundamental limitations of standard models and training routines in addition to providing actionable insights regarding the design of improved surrogates.</description>

      <title>Generative Latent Space Dynamics of Electron Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the time-dependent evolution of electron density is essential for understanding quantum mechanical behaviors of condensed matter and enabling predictive simulations in spectroscopy, photochemistry, and ultrafast science. Yet, while machine learning methods have advanced static density prediction, modeling its spatiotemporal dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a generative framework that combines a 3D convolutional autoencoder with a latent diffusion model (LDM) to learn electron density trajectories from ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our method encodes electron densities into a compact latent space and predicts their future states by sampling from the learned conditional distribution, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without drift or collapse. To preserve statistical fidelity, we incorporate a scaled Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization that aligns generated and reference density distributions. On AIMD trajectories of liquid lithium at 800 K, our model accurately captures both the spatial correlations and the log-normal-like statistical structure of the density. The proposed framework has the potential to accelerate the simulation of quantum dynamics and overcome key challenges faced by current spatiotemporal machine learning methods as surrogates of quantum mechanical simulators.</description>

      <title>Particle swarm optimization of divertor targets for heat load control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divertor targets in magnetic confinement fusion devices must be designed to handle extreme heat loads. Fast approximation of heat loads with FLARE based on field line reconstruction from an unstructured flux tube mesh is utilized in particle swarm optimization (PSO) of the divertor target geometry. Optimization of the outer divertor target in ITER is evaluated with a constraint for the head loads onto baffles. The optimal configuration is found to depend on assumptions for the background plasma in the heat load proxy simulation.</description>

      <title>rhodent: A Python package for analyzing real-time TDDFT response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform, spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code, but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples, for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Residual Stress in Random Microstructures: Mean-Field Estimates and Full-Field Validations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations of local fields are crucial for the prediction of failure in random composites across different scales as well as estimating the inelastic behaviour of it. This can be quantified statistically through second moments of the local fields, which can be quickly estimated using mean field homogenization (MFH). However, the exact fluctuation field can be estimated using full-field methods though it comes at the cost of intensive computational resources and limited scalability to complex microstructures. In this work, MFH is used to estimate the statistical variation of the field quantities and then cross-verified with full-field methods for a linear-thermoelastic homogenization problem. An analytical expression to calculate the second moments of the local fields for a linear thermo-elastic problem using MFH is obtained based on the Hill-Mandel condition. The expressions fundamentally rely on the solution of linear elastic problem which in turn depends on the derivatives of Hill's polarization tensor. Solution of this derivative term has been analytically and semianalytically derived in previous work [1]. The statistical distribution of residual stress tensor components and equivalent stress in particulate and unidirectional fibrous composites, arising purely due to differential thermal expansion, is computed and compared with full-field homogenization. Full-field simulations indicated a non-Gaussian distribution of stress components, whereas Weibull-like distributions for equivalent residual stress. Nevertheless, the assumed Gaussian distribution in mean-field estimates captures the essential features.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised neural operator for solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) provide a new paradigm for efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their training depends on costly high-fidelity data from numerical solvers, limiting applications in complex systems. We propose a self-supervised neural operator (SNO) that generates accurate and diverse training data on the fly without numerical solvers. SNO consists of three parts: a physics-informed sampler (PI-sampler) based on Bayesian PINNs for efficient data generation, a function encoder (FE) for compact input-output representations, and an encoder-only Transformer for operator learning, mapping boundary/initial conditions, source terms, and geometries to PDE solutions. We validate SNO on 1D steady/unsteady nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, a 2D nonlinear PDE with varying geometries, and vortex-induced vibration of a flexible cylinder in fluid dynamics. SNO achieves high accuracy in all cases, and lightweight finetuning (O(100) trainable variables) further improves predictions with only a few hundred steps. This work provides a new route toward pretrained foundation models as efficient PDE surrogates.</description>

      <title>Multiscale light-matter dynamics in quantum materials: from electrons to topological superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter dynamics in topological quantum materials enables ultralow-power, ultrafast devices. A challenge is simulating multiple field and particle equations for light, electrons, and atoms over vast spatiotemporal scales on Exaflop/s computers with increased heterogeneity and low-precision focus. We present a paradigm shift that solves the multiscale/multiphysics/heterogeneity challenge harnessing hardware heterogeneity and low-precision arithmetic. Divide-conquer-recombine algorithms divide the problem into not only spatial but also physical subproblems of small dynamic ranges and minimal mutual information, which are mapped onto best-characteristics-matching hardware units, while metamodel-space algebra minimizes communication and precision requirements. Using 60,000 GPUs of Aurora, DC-MESH (divide-and-conquer Maxwell-Ehrenfest-surface hopping) and XS-NNQMD (excited-state neural-network quantum molecular dynamics) modules of MLMD (multiscale light-matter dynamics) software were 152- and 3,780-times faster than the state-of-the-art for 15.4 million-electron and 1.23 trillion-atom PbTiO3 material, achieving 1.87 EFLOP/s for the former. This enabled the first study of light-induced switching of topological superlattices for future ferroelectric 'topotronics'.</description>

      <title>Learning by training: emergent return-point memory from cyclically tuning disordered sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many living and artificial systems improve their fitness or performance by adapting to changing environments or diverse training data. However, it remains unclear how such environmental variation influences adaptation, what is learned in the process, and whether memory of past conditions is retained. In this work, we investigate these questions using athermal disordered systems that are subject to cyclic inverse design, enabling them to attain target elastic properties spanning a chosen range. We demonstrate that such systems evolve toward a marginally absorbing manifold (MAM), which encodes memory of the training range that closely resembles return-point memory observed in cyclically driven systems. We further propose a general mechanism for the formation of MAMs and the corresponding memory that is based on gradient discontinuities in the trained quantities. Our model provides a simple and broadly applicable physical framework for understanding how adaptive systems learn under environmental change and how they retain memory of past experiences.</description>

      <title>Explaining Optomechanical Libration Spectra: A Stochastic Simulation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical and computationally effective Ito-Taylor expansion based stochastic simulation framework for modeling rotational optomechanics experiments. By developing a model using this framework, we could capture the nonlinear orientation dynamics of an optically levitated, nearly cylindrically symmetric nanodumbbell. It successfully reproduces and explains shoulder-like features observed in the power spectral density of libration, which we show arising from the interplay between confined libration and thermally driven rotation around the particle symmetry axis.</description>

      <title>Inference of epidemic networks: the effect of different data types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the properties of epidemic networks change depending on the availability of different types of data on a disease outbreak. This is achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia. We find that network properties that are important for the management of the outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference.</description>

      <title>Probing the partition function for temperature-dependent potentials with nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic properties can be in principle derived from the partition function, which, in many-atom systems, is hard to evaluate as it involves a sum on the accessible microscopic states. Recently, the partition function has been computed via nested sampling, relying on Bayesian statistics, which is able to provide the density of states as a function of the energy in a single run, independently of the temperature. This appealing property is lost whenever the potential energy that appears in the partition function is temperature-dependent: for instance, mean-field effective potential energies or the quantum partition function in the path-integral formalism. For these cases, the nested sampling must be carried out at each temperature, which results in a massive increase of computational time. Here, we introduce and implement a new method, that is based on an extended partition function where the temperature is considered as an additional parameter to be sampled. The extended partition function can be evaluated by nested sampling in a single run, so to restore this highly desirable property even for temperature-dependent effective potential energies. We apply this original method to compute the quantum partition function for harmonic potentials and Lennard-Jones clusters at low temperatures and show that it outperforms the straightforward application of nested sampling for each temperature within several temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>Bryne: sustainable prototyping of finite element models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source simulation frameworks are evolving rapidly to provide accessible tools for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Modern finite element (FEM) software such as FEniCS, Firedrake, or dune-fem alleviates the need for modelers to recode the discretization and linear solver backend for each application and enables rapid prototyping of solvers. However, while it has become easier to build prototype FEM models, creating a solver reusable beyond its specific initial simulation setup remains difficult. Moreover, simulation setups typically cover an ample input parameter space, and tracking complex metadata on research project time scales has become a challenge. This implies the need to supplement model development with a coding-intensive complementary workstream, seldom developed for sustainable reuse. To address these issues, we introduce our open-source Python package Bryne. Bryne is an object-oriented framework for FEM solvers built with the dune-fem Python API. In this article, we describe how it helps to evolve rapid-prototyping solver development into sustainable simulation building. First, we show how to translate a minimal dune-fem solver into a Bryne FEM model to build human-readable, metadata-enriched simulations. Bryne then offers a simulation driver and model coupling interfaces to combine implemented solvers in operator-split multiphysics simulations. The resulting reproducibility-enabled infrastructure allows users to tackle complex simulation setups without sacrificing backend flexibility. We demonstrate the workflow on a convection-coupled phase-change simulation, where a discontinuous Galerkin flow solver is coupled with a solver for solidification phase change.</description>

      <title>Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields in Doped Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material, Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories, as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures, predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware active learning strategies.</description>

Abstract: The development of quantum neural networks (QNNs) has attracted considerable attention due to their potential to surpass classical models in certain machine learning tasks. Nonetheless, it remains unclear under which conditions QNNs provide concrete benefits over classical neural networks (CNNs). This study addresses this question by performing both qualitative and quantitative analyses of classical and quantum models applied to regression problems, using two target functions with contrasting properties. Additionally, the work explores the methodological difficulties inherent in making fair comparisons between QNNs and CNNs. The findings reveal a distinct advantage of QNNs in a specific quantum machine learning context. In particular, QNNs excelled at approximating the sinusoidal function, achieving errors up to seven orders of magnitude lower than their classical counterparts. However, their performance was limited in other cases, emphasizing that QNNs are highly effective for certain tasks but not universally sPuperior. These results reinforce the principles of the ``No Free Lunch'' theorem, highlighting that no single model outperforms all others across every problem domain.</description>

      <title>Local extraction of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection X-lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is one of the most important magnetic energy conversion processes observed in laboratory and space plasmas. It describes the breaking and joining of magnetic field lines, leading to the release of magnetic energy and the acceleration of charged particles. Finding regions where fast reconnection occurs is key to understanding this process. However, identifying such reconnection events within a turbulent environment in three dimensions remains a challenge. In this work, we develop a new framework for identifying magnetic reconnection using 3D turbulent plasma simulations. First, we apply bifurcation lines from fluid visualization to magnetic fields and show that they can be identified with X-lines of magnetic reconnection. For reconnection configurations with magnetic guide fields, we introduce a novel concept of quasi X-lines (QXL). Using the spatial information of X-lines in numerical simulations, we present a local technique to estimate the reconnection rate, obtaining a distribution that features a local maximum near the normalized value 0.1. Additionally, we provide an alternative tool to highlight current sheets in turbulent plasma by measuring magnetic shear layers as the second invariant of the shear strain tensor. These methods, avoiding traditional reliance on global methods, electric fields and current density, offer a new perspective to the quantitative study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with complex magnetic field topologies. Validated across various plasma simulation models, including kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), our approach enables efficient exploration of magnetic field dynamics in turbulent plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Emergent Rotational Order and Re-entrant Global Order of Vicsek Agents in a Complex Noise Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in active matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment cues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and swarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek agents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region ($\eta_{\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\eta_{\text{b}} = 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer noise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\phi_r$) that peaks at higher noise levels ($\eta_{\text{b}}\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and susceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve, $\phi \sim 0.965$ at $\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\phi \sim 0.57$ at $\eta_b=0.9$ and re-enters at $\eta_b &gt; 1$ and peaks $\phi \sim 0.960$ at $\eta_b=1.5$. The latter rise attributing to $\phi_r$ increase. Higher particle velocities enhance escape rates ($\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving agents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics through time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating velocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility agent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing a gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces both global ($\phi$) and rotational ($\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact of environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change. These findings offer insights into predicting and manipulating active agent dynamics in heterogeneous environments, with applications in biological and synthetic swarming systems.</description>

      <title>Interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann simulation of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of an interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann method (ISLBM) for simulating buoyancy-driven thermal convection on non-uniform meshes. The ISLBM extends the standard lattice Boltzmann framework by incorporating quadratic interpolation during the streaming step, enabling flexible mesh refinement near solid boundaries while maintaining algorithmic simplicity and parallel scalability. The method is implemented for a two-dimensional side-heated cavity at high Rayleigh numbers $10^6 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, and for a three-dimensional side-heated cavity at $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^7$, with the Prandtl number fixed at $Pr=0.71$. Benchmark results show that the ISLBM accurately captures thermal and velocity boundary layers, yielding Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in close agreement with high-fidelity reference data. Grid-convergence studies demonstrate nearly third-order accuracy for global quantities and about second-order for local fields. We further assess the computational performance of the in-house LBM solver against two open-source solvers: Nek5000 based on the spectral element method, and OpenFOAM based on the finite volume method. Performance metrics, including million lattice updates per second (MLUPS) and wall-clock time per dimensionless time unit (WCTpDT), indicate that the ISLBM offers one to three orders of magnitude higher efficiency in large-scale simulations. On GPU architectures, the ISLBM retains high computational performance: throughput on non-uniform meshes reaches 60 -- 70\% of that on uniform meshes in terms of MLUPS, while the cost in WCTpDT is about three times higher. These results highlight the potential of interpolation-based LBM approaches for high-fidelity simulations of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes, providing a robust foundation for future extensions to turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>RAMS: Residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample method for scientific machine learning in solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, two leading scientific machine learning (SciML) paradigms, have emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Although increasing the training sample size generally enhances network performance, it also increases computational costs for physics-informed or data-driven training. To address this trade-off, different sampling strategies have been developed to sample more points in regions with high PDE residuals. However, existing sampling methods are computationally demanding for high-dimensional problems, such as high-dimensional PDEs or operator learning tasks. Here, we propose a residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample (RAMS) method, which moves samples according to the adversarial gradient direction to maximize the PDE residual via gradient-based optimization. RAMS can be easily integrated into existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments, ranging from PINN applied to high-dimensional PDEs to physics-informed and data-driven operator learning problems, have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMS. Notably, RAMS represents the first efficient adaptive sampling approach for operator learning, marking a significant advancement in the SciML field.</description>

      <title>Equivariant U-Shaped Neural Operators for the Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries. Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics, achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.</description>

      <title>A geometrically robust unfitted boundary algebraic equation method based on discrete potentials and local basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an unfitted boundary algebraic equation (BAE) method for solving elliptic partial differential equations in complex geometries. The method employs lattice Green's functions on infinite regular grids combined with discrete potential theory to construct single and double layer potentials, which is a discrete analog to boundary integral method. Local basis functions on cut cells accommodate arbitrary boundary conditions and seamlessly integrate with the boundary algebraic equations. The difference potentials framework enables efficient treatment of nonhomogeneous terms and fast computation of layer potentials via FFT-based solvers. We establish theoretical stability and convergence through a novel interpolation operator framework. Key advantages of the developed method include: dimension reduction, geometric flexibility, mesh-independent conditioning, small-cut stability, and uniform treatment of smooth and non-smooth geometries. Numerical experiments validate accuracy and robustness across ellipses and diamonds with varying aspect ratios and sharp corners, and an application of potential flows in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Nematic State in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit exceptional dielectric and electromechanical properties, yet their microscopic origins remain elusive due to the interplay of hierarchical polar structures and chemical complexity. While models based on polar nanoregions or nanodomains offer valuable phenomenological insights, they often lack the first-principles predictive capability necessary for quantitatively describing functional properties such as piezoelectric coefficients. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, enabled by a universal first-principles-based machine-learning interatomic potential, to investigate atomic-scale polar dynamics in canonical Pb-, Bi-, and Ba-based relaxors. Across all systems, we uncover a universal dipolar nematic state, characterized by long-range orientational order of local polarizations without local alignment, challenging conventional polar cluster-based paradigms. We introduce a universal order parameter, derived from the skewness of the distributions of the local polarization autocorrelation functions, that captures the thermal evolution of both lead-based and lead-free systems within a single master curve. This nematic order, and its robust structural memory under electric field cycling, underpins key relaxor phenomena, including diffuse phase transition, frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion, and reversible giant piezoelectricity. Our findings establish a unified microscopic framework for relaxors and present a broadly applicable statistical approach to understanding complex disordered materials.</description>

      <title>TransMatch: A Transfer-Learning Framework for Defect Detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images, TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches. Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal information injection and transfer mechanisms for active matter reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms, which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer. Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.</description>

      <title>LUCIE-3D: A three-dimensional climate emulator for forced responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals, including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2 concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes, while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient, training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability, physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and future Earth system emulation.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo across diverse community codes: The case of water-methane dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.</description>

      <title>Identifying Optimal Regression Models For DEM Simulation Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing fast regression models (surrogate/metamodels) from DEM data is key for practical industrial application to allow real-time evaluations. However, benchmarking different models is often overlooked in particle technology for regression tasks, as model selection is frequently not the primary research focus. This can lead to the use of suboptimal models, resulting in subpar predictive accuracy, slow evaluations, or poor generalisation, hindering effective real-time decision-making and process optimisation. In this work, we discuss applying k-fold cross-validation to assess regression models for tabular DEM datasets and propose a simple framework for readers to follow to find the optimal model for their data. An example demonstrates its application to a DEM dataset of packing fractions measured in a simple measuring beaker with varying inter-particle properties, namely, average particle diameter, coefficient of restitution, coefficient of sliding friction, coefficient of rolling resistance, and cohesive energy density. Out of 16 different models tested, a histogram-based gradient boosting model was found to be optimal, providing a good fit with acceptable training and inference times.</description>

Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate- and Extremely High-Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- to 5+ and 6- to 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm that emphasizes input parameters with the highest variance during training and identifies the most significant ones influencing the outputs based on a computed metric called "potentiality". We focus on the dependence of solar wind plasma density on moderate-geomagnetic conditions. It has been unclear from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL extracted solar wind velocity as the predominant parameter at extremely low (0 to 1+) and high-Kp ranges under southward IMF. In this study, the IMF three components, solar wind speed, and plasma density from the OMNI database (1998-2019), covering solar cycle 23 to early 25, were used as inputs. Again, PL selected solar wind velocity as the most significant parameter for moderate and extremely high Kp. The potentiality of solar wind density for these ranges was, however, 3.5 times higher than in the previous study, suggesting its impact on geomagnetic activity cannot be ignored. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as PL inputs under all Kp levels. Above moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind if density is large, suggesting that not only velocity but also density contributes significantly. These PL and statistical investigations show that solar wind density begins to regulate Kp above moderate geomagnetic activity under southward IMF. They also help understand the relationship between solar wind and geomagnetic activity and forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>

      <title>Local mobility variations along recrystallization boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding recrystallization boundary migration mechanisms is crucial for materials design. However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. Here, we propose an Iterative Mobility Matching (IMM) methodology to determine local mobility values and their spatial variations along recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This method optimizes mobility inputs in a phase field model by matching simulated microstructures with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method using synthetic data before applying it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. The results show that local mobility depends strongly on boundary misorientation, and its variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. The IMM methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Wall boundary conditions for Lattice Boltzmann simulations of turbulent flows with wall functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates wall boundary condition schemes for the simulation of turbulent flows using the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) coupled to turbulence models with wall functions. The analysis focuses on two schemes: a regularized boundary scheme with third-order reconstruction of the velocity gradients using wall function data and a slip-velocity bounce-back scheme. The LBM solver is coupled to the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model and uses a model consistent wall function. The performance of the wall boundary schemes is assessed in two canonical turbulent flow cases, a fully developed channel flow and a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate boundary layer (BL), selected specifically to isolate and analyze the impact of wall boundary treatments on turbulence modeling. The analysis shows that, for the selected test cases, the slip-velocity bounce-back approach, which has received relatively little attention within the context of LBM coupled to Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models with wall functions, behaves fairly consistently in terms of both accuracy and mesh convergence. The regularized-based approach, on the other hand, appears to be highly sensitive to the reconstruction of the wall-normal velocity gradient, even in simple geometries such as flat walls where no interpolation is required. This dependency of the regularized boundary schemes on near-wall gradients, which had been noted before in the literature, requires the use of ad-hoc gradient reconstruction techniques, requirements that are not present in the slip-velocity bounce-back method. A hybrid regularized boundary scheme that blends two different gradient reconstruction techniques but requires calibration is introduced as a tool to investigate this effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport calculations: An effective medium theory based on the projector augmented wave method with the plane-wave basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Structure Preserving Finite Volume Schemes on Voronoi Grids: Curl Involution, Asymptotic Limit and Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new curl-free and thermodynamically compatible finite volume scheme on Voronoi grids to solve compressible heat conducting flows written in first-order hyperbolic form. The approach is based on the definition of compatible discrete curl-grad operators, exploiting the triangular nature of the dual mesh. We design a cell solver reminiscent of the nodal solvers used in Lagrangian schemes to discretize the evolution equation for the thermal impulse vector, and we demonstrate that the resulting numerical scheme ensures energy conservation, local non-negative entropy production, as well as asymptotic consistency with the classical Fourier law in the stiff relaxation limit. A novel technique is proposed to transfer residuals from the dual to the primal mesh as subfluxes, which eventually yields the construction of entropy compatible semi-discrete methods. The scheme and its properties are validated on a set of numerical test cases.</description>

      <title>EAC-Net: Predicting real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities, EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <title>AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the effects of physical perturbations on optical channels is critical for advanced photonic devices, but existing modelling techniques are often computationally intensive or require exhaustive characterisation. We present a novel data-efficient machine learning framework that learns the perturbation-dependent transmission matrix of a multimode fibre. To overcome the challenge of modelling the resulting highly oscillatory functions, we encode the perturbation into a Fourier Feature basis, enabling a compact multi-layer perceptron to learn the mapping with high fidelity. On experimental data from a compressed fibre, our model predicts the output field with a 0.995 complex correlation to the ground truth, improving accuracy by an order of magnitude over standard networks while using 85\% fewer parameters. This approach provides a general tool for modelling complex optical systems from sparse measurements.</description>
