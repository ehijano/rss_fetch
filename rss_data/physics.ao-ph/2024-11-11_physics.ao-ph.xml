      <title>A Stochastic Conceptual Model for the Coupled ENSO and MJO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is essential to studying climate variabilities and predicting extreme weather events. Here, we develop a stochastic conceptual model for describing the coupled ENSO-MJO phenomenon. The model adopts a three-box representation of the interannual ocean component to characterize the ENSO diversity. For the intraseasonal atmospheric component, a low-order Fourier representation is used to describe the eastward propagation of the MJO. We incorporate decadal variability to account for modulations in the background state that influence the predominant types of El Nino events. In addition to dynamical coupling through wind forcing and latent heat, state-dependent noise is introduced to characterize the statistical interactions among these multiscale processes, improving the simulation of extreme events. The model successfully reproduces the observed non-Gaussian statistics of ENSO diversity and MJO spectra. It also captures the interactions between wind, MJO, and ENSO.</description>

      <title>WeatherGFM: Learning A Weather Generalist Foundation Model via In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's weather system encompasses intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>Stratification governs the Existence of Surface-Intensified Eastward Jets in Turbulent Gyres without Bottom Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the role of stratification in the formation and persistence of eastward jets (like the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio currents). Using a wind-driven, two-layer quasi-geostrophic model in a double-gyre configuration, we construct a phase diagram to classify flow regimes. The parameter space is defined by a criticality parameter $\xi$, which controls the emergence of baroclinic instability, and the ratio of layer depths $\delta$, which describes the surface intensification of stratification. Eastward jets detaching from the western boundary are observed when $\delta \ll 1$ and $\xi \sim 1$, representing a regime transition from a vortex-dominated western boundary current to a zonostrophic regime characterized by multiple eastward jets. Remarkably, these surface-intensified patterns emerge without considering bottom friction. The emergence of the coherent eastward jet is further addressed with complementary 1.5-layer simulations and explained through both linear stability analysis and turbulence phenomenology. In particular, we show that coherent eastward jets emerge when the western boundary layer is stable, and find that the asymmetry in the baroclinic instability of eastward and westward flows plays a central role in the persistence of eastward jets, while contributing to the disintegration of westward jets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Mode Decomposition of Geostrophically Balanced Motions from SWOT Altimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decomposition of oceanic flow into its balanced and unbalanced motions carries theoretical and practical significance for the oceanographic community. These two motions have distinct dynamical characteristics and affect the transport of tracers differently from one another. The launch of Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite provides a prime opportunity to diagnose the surface balanced and unbalanced motions on a global scale at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Here, we apply dynamic-mode decomposition (DMD), a linear-algebraic data-driven method, to a tidally-forced numerical simulation and one-day-repeat SWOT observations of sea-surface height (SSH) in the Gulf Stream extension. DMD is able to separate out the spatial modes associated with sub-inertial periods from super-inertial periods. The sub-inertial modes of DMD can be used to extract geostrophically balanced motions from SSH fields, which have an imprint of internal tides and gravity waves. We utilize the statistical relation between relative vorticity and strain rate as the metric to gauge the extraction of geostrophy.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Drifter Path Identification and Prediction: SINDy vs Neural ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the performance of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in identification of the underlying mechanisms of open ocean Lagrangian drifter hydrodynamics with possible applications in coastal and port hydrodynamic processes. With this motivation we employ two different Lagrangian drifter datasets acquired by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s surface buoys with proper World Meteorological Organization (WMO) numbers. In the SINDy approach, the primary goal is to identify the drifter paths of buoys using ordinary differential equation sets with a minimal number of sparse coefficients. In the neural ODE approach, the goal is to identify the derivative of the hidden state of a neural network (NN). Using the acquired data, we examine the applicability of the SINDy and the neural ODE algorithms in identification of the drifter trajectories comparatively. We propose that while both of the algorithms may give acceptable results for open ocean, the SINDy-based algorithmic approach can predict the Lagrangian drifter paths more accurately and consistently at least for the datasets investigated and parameters selected. A discussion of our findings with potential applications in search and rescue missions in the open ocean, their limitations and applicability are also presented.</description>

      <title>Taming Uncertainty in a Complex World: The Rise of Uncertainty Quantification -- A Tutorial for Beginners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial about uncertainty quantification (UQ) for those who have no background but are interested in learning more in this area. It exploits many very simple examples, which are understandable to undergraduates, to present the ideas of UQ. Topics include characterizing uncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and UQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each topic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both MATLAB and Python codes are made available for these simple examples.</description>
