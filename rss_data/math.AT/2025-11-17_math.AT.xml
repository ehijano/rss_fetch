      <title>Autonomous motion in changing environment, fibrations and reaction mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop further the formalism of fibrations of configuration spaces as a tool for modelling motion of autonomous systems in variable environments. We analyse the situations when the external conditions may change during the motion of the system and analyse two possibilities: (a) when the behaviour of the external conditions is known in advance; and (b) when the future changes of the external conditions are unknown but we can measure the current state and the current velocity of the external conditions, at every moment of time. We prove that in the case (a) the complexity of the motion algorithm is the same as in the case of constant external conditions; this generalises the result of \cite{FGY}. In case (b) we introduce a new concept of a reaction mechanism which allows to take into account unexpected and unpredictable changes in the environment. A reaction mechanism is mathematically an infinitesimal lifting function on a fibre bundle, a nonlinear generalisation of the classical concept of an Ehresmann connection. We illustrate these notions by examples which show that nonlinear infinitesimal lifting function (reaction mechanisms) appear naturally, are inevitable and ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>Effective Resistance in Simplicial Complexes as Bilinear Forms: Generalizations and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of effective resistance, originally introduced in electrical circuit theory, has been extended to the setting of graphs by interpreting each edge as a resistor. In this context, the effective resistance between two vertices quantifies the total opposition to current flow when a unit current is injected at one vertex and extracted at the other. Beyond its physical interpretation, the effective resistance encodes rich structural and geometric information about the underlying graph: it defines a metric on the vertex set, relates to the topology of the graph through Foster's theorem, and determines the probability of an edge appearing in a random spanning tree. Generalizations of effective resistance to simplicial complexes have been proposed in several forms, often formulated as matrix products of standard operators associated with the complex.
  In this paper, we present a twofold generalization of the effective resistance. First, we introduce a novel, basis-independent bilinear form, derived from an algebraic reinterpretation of circuit theory, that extends the classical effective resistance from graphs. Second, we extend this bilinear form to simplices, chains, and cochains within simplicial complexes. This framework subsumes and unifies all existing matrix-based formulations of effective resistance. Moreover, we establish higher-order analogues of several fundamental properties known in the graph case: (i) we prove that effective resistance induces a pseudometric on the space of chains and a metric on the space of cycles, and (ii) we provide a generalization of Foster's Theorem to simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Hyperelliptic four-manifolds defined by vector-colorings of simple polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toric topology assigns to each simple convex $n$-polytope $P$ with $m$ facets an $n$-dimensional real moment angle manifold $\mathbb RZ_P$ with a canonical action of $\mathbb Z_2^m=(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^m$. We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on $\mathbb RZ_P$. The orbit space $N(P,H)=\mathbb RZ_P/H$ has an action of $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$. For general $n$ we introduce the notion of a Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex in the boundary of an $n$-polytope $P$ generalizing the notions of a Hamiltonian cycle ($k=2$), Hamiltonian theta-subgraph ($k=3$) and Hamiltonian $K_4$-subgraph ($k=4)$ in the $1$-skeleton of a $3$-polytope. Each $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \partial P$ corresponds to a subgroup $H_C\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $N(P,H_C)\simeq S^n$. We prove that in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. Any subgroup $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ defines a complex $C(P,H)\subset \partial P$. We prove that each Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset C(P,H)$ inducing $H$ corresponds to a hyperelliptic involution $\tau_C\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ on the manifold $N(P,H)$ (that is, an involution with the orbit space homeomorphic to $S^n$) and in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. We prove that for the geometries $\mathbb X= \mathbb S^4$, $\mathbb S^3\times\mathbb R$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb S^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb R^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb L^2$, and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb L^2$ there exists a compact right-angled $4$-polytope $P$ with a free action of $H$ such that the geometric manifold $N(P,H)$ has a hyperelliptic involution in $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, and for $\mathbb X=\mathbb R^4$, $\mathbb L^4$, $\mathbb L^3\times \mathbb R$ and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb R^2$ there are no such polytopes.</description>

      <title>Unexpected loss of maximality: the case of Hilbert square of real surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the maximality of the Hilbert square of maximal real surfaces, and find that in many cases the Hilbert square is maximal if and only if the surface has connected real locus. In particular, the Hilbert square of no maximal K3-surface is maximal. Nevertheless, we exhibit maximal surfaces with disconnected real locus whose Hilbert square is maximal.</description>

      <title>Homology of matching complexes and representations of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the homology of the matching complex $M(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the complete hypergraph on $n\geq 2$ vertices, and analyse the $S_n$-representations carried by this homology. These results are achieved using standard techniques in combinatorial topology, such as the theory of shellings. We then broaden the scope to the larger class of fibre-closed families of simplicial complexes and consider these through the lens of representation stability. This allows us to prove a number of results of an asymptotic nature, such as an analysis of the growth of Betti numbers and the kinds of irreducible $S_n$-representations that appear.</description>

      <title>A Representability Theorem for Stacks in Derived Geometry Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representability theorem for stacks, due to Artin in the underived setting and Lurie in the derived setting, gives conditions under which a stack is representable by an $n$-geometric stack. In recent work of Ben-Bassat, Kelly, and Kremnizer, a new theory of derived analytic geometry has been proposed as geometry relative to the $(\infty,1)$-category of simplicial commutative Ind-Banach $R$-modules, for $R$ a Banach ring. In this paper, we prove a representability theorem which holds in a very general context, which we call a representability context, encompassing both the derived algebraic geometry context of To\"en and Vezzosi and these new derived analytic geometry contexts. The representability theorem gives natural and easily verifiable conditions for checking that derived stacks in these contexts are $n$-geometric, such as having an $n$-geometric truncation, being nilcomplete, and having an obstruction theory. Future work will explore representability of certain moduli stacks arising in derived analytic geometry, for example moduli stacks of Galois representations.</description>
