      <title>Enhanced nuclear fusion in the sub-keV energy regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion requires overcoming or traversing a repulsive Coulomb barrier of hundreds of kiloelectronvolts, rendering the probability of fusion at sub-keV energies vanishingly small. Yet in condensed matter, the electronic and structural environment of reacting nuclei can profoundly alter fusion rates. Here we demonstrate that deuterium-deuterium fusion within metallic foils exhibits a pronounced enhancement and reaction yield plateau below energies of 2.5 keV- contrary to the expected exponential suppression with decreasing energy. Using a dual-chamber platform that combines electrochemical deuterium loading with ion-beam bombardment, we show that fusion yields in palladium and titanium hydrides are enhanced by over 10^18 compared to theoretical bare-nucleus fusion rates. These results demonstrate that access to low-energy fusion processes can be governed by materials degrees of freedom. This materials-driven fusion regime establishes a reproducible, tunable framework for studying and ultimately engineering nuclear reactions in solids. While the reaction rates reported here are low, these insights into materials-modulated fusion processes offer a potential foundation for understanding how condensed-matter environments could influence future fusion-energy concepts.</description>

      <title>Identified charged hadron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV with the STAR detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on the production of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC, at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt;$ 0.1). Invariant yields of these particles as a function of transverse momentum are shown. We determine bulk properties such as integrated particle yields ($dN/dy$), mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{T} \rangle$), particle ratios, which provide insight into the particle production mechanisms. Additionally, the kinetic freeze-out parameters ($T_\text{kin}$ and $\langle \beta_{T} \rangle$), which provide information about the dynamics of the system at the time of freeze-out, are obtained. The Bjorken energy density ($\epsilon_{BJ}$), which gives an estimate of the energy density in the central rapidity region of the collision zone at the formation time $\tau$, is calculated and presented as a function of multiplicity for various energies. The results are compared with those from the models such as A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) and Heavy Ion Jet INteraction Generator (HIJING) for further insights.</description>

      <title>New results on $\phi$(1020) production from the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NA61/SHINE is a multipurpose, fixed-target hadron spectrometer at the CERN SPS. Its research program includes studies of strong interactions as well as reference measurements for neutrino and cosmic-ray physics. A significant advantage of NA61/SHINE over collider experiments is its extended coverage of phase space available for particle production. This includes the entire projectile hemisphere of the collision, with no low-pT cut-off. The energy and system-size dependence of strangeness production plays an essential role in studies of the transition from confined to deconfined matter. With its zero net strangeness and its valence structure composed predominantly of s and $\bar{s}$ valence quarks, the $\phi$(1020) meson will not be sensitive to strangeness-related effects in a purely hadronic scenario, but will behave like a doubly strange particle in a partonic system.
  This contribution presents the first-ever results on $\phi$(1020) meson production in intermediate-size systems at the CERN SPS, that is, central Ar+Sc collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$ = 8.8, 11.9, and 16.8 GeV. The presented results include double-differential rapidity-transverse momentum (y-pT) distributions, transverse mass (mT) spectra at midrapidity, pT-integrated rapidity spectra, mean multiplicities (4$\pi$ yields), and particle ratios. These are compared to data on Pb+Pb and p+p collisions. A discussion of open and hidden strangeness production enhancement is included. Finally, a comparison with three microscopic models is shown, demonstrating their overall failure in describing these new measurements.</description>

      <title>The program Simourg for simulating the response functions of gamma detectors with simple geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The program Simourg (Simulator of Usually Requested Geometries) is based on the Geant4 toolkit and created for Monte Carlo simulation of gamma-ray spectrometric nuclear detectors with a simple axial symmetric geometry, which is typical for many tasks of studying the decay of long-lived nuclei and measuring the radioactivity of natural objects. The program is designed for quick estimation of the effectiveness and the response function of the detector to monoenergetic gamma quanta in the energy range from keV to several MeV.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of optical photon propagation in low photon yield applications: Opticks for the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of time spent in the simulation of Cherenkov and other scintillation detectors is spent on optical-photon transport, i.e. ray tracing, a task that GPUs are uniquely qualified to perform. We present EIC-Opticks, a fork of Opticks, which uses event aggregation to drastically accelerate photon transport simulation for low-to-moderate photon yield experiments. During the full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of a given detector, optical photon simulation is performed on GPU(s) using the NVIDIA OptiX framework. We validate this approach using the ePIC pfRICH detector. We find GPU and CPU simulations in excellent agreement. For $5\times 10^4$ electrons with a momentum of $p=5~\mathrm{MeV}/c$ in the test case of the pfRICH detector, EIC-Opticks shows an order-of-magnitude speedup over multi-threaded Geant4, and a factor of up to 161$\pm$3 over single-threaded execution. In the case of low-to-moderate applications event aggregation reduces the per-photon simulation time from $\sim60\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ for single events to $\sim20\,\mathrm{ns}$ with batching, a factor of $\sim3000$. In order to make EIC-Opticks easily installable, we authored a Spack package that makes it possible to install it with a single command. Additionally, a Docker container is provided for users with EIC-Opticks installed. EIC-Opticks provides guardrails for common pitfalls (e.g. nested volume conversion, ray tracing setting optimization).</description>

      <title>Solitons in Quasi-Neutral non-Equilibrated Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an experiment performed in November 2022 at the one-petawatt (PW) laser facility Vega III in Salamanca, Spain, we studied the production of several radioisotopes using the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) method (M. Rodrigues et al. [1], K. Batani et al. [12]). Using the experimental proton energy distribution recorded on a shot-by-shot basis and confirmed on average in a follow-up experiment, we derive the number of nuclear reactions on different targets for a single shot. From this single-shot analysis, we obtain an effective plasma temperature per shot from the yield ratio 11C/7Be. This gives strong limits to the yields of the reaction p + 11B -&gt; 3 alpha, which may reach (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 as in 2pi. From the fluctuations of the proton spectra and the fusion yields, we derive the TNSA Equation of State (EOS). The deviation of this EOS from the classical ideal gas limit indicates that the plasma is non-neutral and well described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Solitons drive the system toward charge neutrality. We derive an effective soliton mass of ms = (26 +/- 1) meV and a soliton speed on the order of vs/c ~ 0.06. Understanding the soliton dynamics is crucial for applications and basic science.</description>

      <title>Observation of two nuclear recoil peaks induced by neutron capture on Al2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of two nuclear recoil peaks induced by neutron capture on aluminum in a cryogenic Al$_2$O$_3$ detector developed by the NUCLEUS collaboration for the detection of reactor neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus (CEvNS) process. Data collected at the Technical University of Munich in 2024 with a $^{252}$Cf source reveal a main recoil line at 1145 eV from single-$\gamma$ de-excitation of $^{28}$Al and a newly observed structure near 575 eV originating from several two-$\gamma$ cascades. The latter constitutes the first direct measurement of a nuclear recoil line induced by multi-$\gamma$ cascades. It is predicted by our simulations when the recoiling nucleus has time to stop before the emission of the next $\gamma$-ray in the cascade. These results demonstrate the potential performance of the CRAB (Calibration Recoil for Accurate Bolometry) method for in situ nuclear recoil calibration and highlight the importance of accurately modeling recoil stopping and nuclear de-excitation times in cryogenic detectors of CEvNS and dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Understanding Charge Radii with Machine Learning: Discovering Physics Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a robust, interpretable machine learning (ML) framework that combines numerical regression for high-accuracy predictions with symbolic regression to uncover the underlying physics. This hybrid approach effciently derives analytical expressions by leveraging the smoothed predictions of optimized ML models, a significant acceleration over direct symbolic regression on raw experimental data.
  We apply this framework, as an example, to nuclear charge radii across the nuclear chart, notably including light nuclei that are often excluded from such studies. We employ Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models to map correlations between charge radii and key physical features: mass $A^{1/3}$ and proton number $Z^{1/3}$ dependencies, total binding energy, and for the first time, the pairing gap. Our models are rigorously trained using four-fold cross-validation with automated hyperparameter optimization, ensuring robustness and generalizability, which is critical for the typically small and skewed datasets in nuclear physics. Finally, we distill the knowledge from the initial LGBM and GPR models into simplified, interpretable mathematical expressions via symbolic regression, white-boxing these ML models. The derived formulas provide physical insights comparable to traditional many-body models and demonstrate a powerful pathway for physics expression discovery guided by ML.</description>

      <title>Lineshape response of plastic scintillator to pair production of 4.44 MeV gamma's</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the distribution of energy deposited in a 40x88 mm plastic scintillator by e+ e- pair production of 4.44 MeV gamma-rays. We observe the double-escape peak of 3.42 MeV from pair production by tagging 511 keV annihilation radiation in two high-Z scintillators. The source is a standard commercial neutron source using alpha-emitting 241Am encapsulated with 9Be, which has a reaction branch feeding the first Ipi=2+ state of 12C making the 4.44 MeV gamma-rays. We demonstrate the extraction of the double-escape peak from the large neutron-produced backgound, and explore some of the features and difficulties of this technique with our apparatus.</description>

      <title>Bound and Resonant States of Muonic Few-Body Coulomb Systems: Extended Stochastic Variational Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the bound and resonant states of hydrogen-like muonic ions ($\mu\mu p$, $\mu\mu d$, $\mu\mu t$) and three-body muonic molecular ions ($pp\mu$, $pd\mu$, $pt\mu$, $dd\mu$, $dt\mu$, $tt\mu$), and the four-body double-muonic hydrogen molecule ($\mu\mu pp$) using an extended stochastic variational method combined with complex scaling. The approach provides a unified treatment of bound and quasibound states and achieves an energy accuracy better than $0.1~\mathrm{eV}$ across all systems studied. Complete spectra below the corresponding $n=2$ atomic thresholds are obtained, including several previously unresolved shallow resonances in both three- and four-body sectors.</description>

      <title>Event-shape dependence of symmetry plane correlations using the Gaussian estimator in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC using a multiphase transport model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlations measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations, and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the branching ratio of $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ isotopes through the nuclear muon capture reaction in the Super-Kamiokande detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Super-Kamiokande detector has measured solar neutrinos for more than $25$ years. The sensitivity for solar neutrino measurement is limited by the uncertainties of energy scale and background modeling. Decays of unstable isotopes with relatively long half-lives through nuclear muon capture, such as $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$ and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$, are detected as background events for solar neutrino observations. In this study, we developed a method to form a pair of stopping muon and decay candidate events and evaluated the production rates of such unstable isotopes. We then measured their branching ratios considering both their production rates and the estimated number of nuclear muon capture processes as $Br(\mathrm{^{16}N})=(9.0 \pm 0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{15}C})=(0.6\pm0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{12}B})=(0.98 \pm 0.18)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{13}B})=(0.14 \pm 0.12)\%$, respectively. The result for $\mathrm{^{16}N}$ has world-leading precision at present and the results for $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ are the first branching ratio measurements for those isotopes.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric figure of merit and the deconfinement phase transition</title>

Abstract: Thermoelectric phenomena are traditionally associated with the interconversion of thermal and electrical energy in many-body systems. In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\( ZT \)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \( ZT \) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \( ZT \) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>

      <title>Calibration Plan for the SBC 10-kg Liquid Argon Detector with 100 eV Target Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.</description>
