      <title>Compact Objects by Extended Gravitational Decoupling in f(G,T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the anisotropic interior spherically symmetric solutions by utilizing the extended gravitational decoupling method in the background of $f(G,T)$ gravity, where $G$ and $T$ signify the Gauss-Bonnet term and trace of the stress-energy tensor, respectively. The anisotropy in the interior geometry arises with the inclusion of an additional source in the isotropic configuration. In this technique, the temporal and radial potentials are decoupled which split the field equations into two independent sets. Both sets individually represent the isotropic and anisotropic configurations, respectively. The solution corresponding to the first set is determined by using the Krori-Barua metric potentials whereas the second set contains unknown which are solved with the help of some constraints. The ultimate anisotropic results are evaluated by combining the solutions of both distributions. The influence of decoupling parameter is examined on the matter variables as well as anisotropic factor. We illustrate the viable and stable features of the constructed solutions by using energy constraints and three stability criteria, respectively. Finally, we conclude that the obtained solutions are viable as well as stable for the whole domain of the coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>The spin magnitude of stellar-mass binary black holes evolves with the mass: evidence from gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between the mass and spin of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) has been proposed to be a smoking gun for the presence of multiple formation channels for compact objects. First-generation black holes (BHs) formed by isolated binary stellar progenitors are expected to have nearly aligned small spins, while nth-generation BBHs resulting from hierarchical mergers are expected to have misaligned and higher spins. Leveraging data from the third observing run O3 (GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3), we employ hierarchical Bayesian methods to conduct a comprehensive study of possible correlations between the BBH masses and spins. We use parametric models that either superpose independent BBH populations or explicitly model a mass-spin correlation. We unveil strong evidence for a correlation between normalized spin magnitudes and masses of BBHs. The correlation can be explained as a transition from a BBH population with low spins at low masses and higher spins for higher masses. Although the spin magnitude distribution at high masses lacks robust constraints, we find strong evidence that a transition between two BBH populations with different spin distributions should happen at 40-50 $M_{\odot}$. In particular, we find that the population of BBHs above 40-50 $M_{\odot}$ should compose the $\sim 2 \%$ of the overall population, with a spin magnitude $\chi$ peaking around 0.7, consistently with the fraction of nth-generation BBHs formed by hierarchical mergers in the latest state-of-the-art BBH genesis simulations.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass black hole binary parameter estimation with next-generation ground-based detector networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios for the formation and evolution of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the mass range $10^2 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$ remain uncertain, but future ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers will probe the lower end of the IMBH mass range. We study the detectability of IMBH binary mergers and the measurability of their parameters with next-generation ground-based detector networks consisting of various combinations of Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET) interferometers. We find that, for binaries with component masses $m_{1,2}\sim 1000\,M_\odot$, an optimal 3-detector network can constrain the masses with errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ ($\lesssim 1\%$) at $z=0.5$ ($z=2$), and the source redshift can be measured with percent-level accuracy or better at $z\lesssim 2$. The redshift of lighter binaries ($m_{1,2}\lesssim 300\,M_\odot$) can still be measured with $O(10)\%$ accuracy even at $z=10$. Binaries with $z\lesssim 0.5$ can be localized within $1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for $m_{1,2}\lesssim 1000\,M_\odot$, and within $0.1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for comparable mass systems. The sky localization is good enough that it may be possible to cross-correlate GW searches with galaxy catalogs and to search for electromagnetic counterparts to IMBH mergers. We also point out that the low-frequency sensitivity of the detectors is crucial for IMBH detection and parameter estimation. It will be interesting to use our results in conjunction with population synthesis codes to constrain astrophysical IMBH formation models.</description>

      <title>Ringdown stability: greybody factors as stable gravitational-wave observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Driven Inspirals of Non-relativistic Binaries Connected by Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider gravitational waves from a pair of non-relativistically moving monopoles or black holes connected by a cosmic string. Shortly after the binary's formation, the connecting string straightens due the direct coupling of its motion to gravitational radiation. Afterwards, the motion of the binary can be well-approximated by a non-relativistic motion of its components that have an additional constant mutual attraction force due to the tension of the straight string that connects them. The orbit shrinks due to the gravitational radiation backreacting on the binary's components. We find that if the binary's semimajor axis $a\gg \sqrt{R_1 R_2/{\mu}}$, its eccentricity grows on the inspiral's timescale; here $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the gravitational radii of the binary components, and $\mu$ is the dimensionless tension of the string. When the eccentricity is high, it approaches unity super-exponentially. If the binary's components are monopole-antimonopole pair, this leads to the physical collision that would likely destroy the string and annihilate the monopoles when the semimajor axis is still many orders of magnitude greater than the string thickness. If the binary's components are black holes, then the eccentricity reaches its peak when $a\sim \sqrt{R_1 R_2/\mu}$, and then decays according to the standard Peter's formula. The black-hole spins initially become locked to the orbital motion, but then lag behind as the inspiral proceeds. We estimate the string-tension-induced dimensionless spins just prior to the merger and find them to be $\sim\mu^{3/8}\ll 1$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical Aspects of Some Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research work in the thesis is focused on the thermodynamic analysis of cosmological models, especially the models that explain late-time cosmic acceleration. According to the cosmological principle, the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic. FRW metric is considered to describe it. In the initial chapter, an overview of cosmology is presented. Chapter 2 delves into thermodynamics applied to cosmology, emphasizing the Generalized Second Law. It thoroughly covers Hayward-Kodama temperature and discusses the apparent horizon and the conditions for thermodynamic stability. Chapter 3 presents a thermodynamic comparison of quintessence models, focusing on thawing and freezing scenarios. Chapter 4 examines Brans-Dicke cosmological models in a spatially isotropic and homogeneous universe, assessing their compatibility with the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics. Chapter 5 explores the thermodynamic viability of various dark energy models reconstructed using the cosmological jerk parameter. Chapter 6 examines a model in a spatially flat FRW spacetime that mimics the characteristics of the $\Lambda$CDM model, assessing its thermodynamic stability. Chapter 7 serves as the epilogue of this thesis, offering not only the final conclusions but also a brief discussion on the presented work and potential future prospects.</description>

      <title>The Common Solution Space of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the solution space for the field equations of Einstein's General Relativity for various static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We consider the vacuum case, represented by the Schwarzschild black hole; the de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry, which includes a cosmological constant; the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry, which accounts for the presence of charge. Additionally we consider the homogenenous and anisotropic locally rotational Bianchi II spacetime in the vacuum. Our analysis reveals that the field equations for these scenarios share a common three-dimensional group of point transformations, with the generators being the elements of the $D\otimes_{s}T_{2}$ Lie algebra, known as the semidirect product of dilations and translations in the plane. Due to this algebraic property the field equations for the aforementioned gravitational models can be expressed in the equivalent form of the null geodesic equations for conformally flat geometries. Consequently, the solution space for the field equations is common, and it is the solution space for the free particle in a flat space. This appoach open new directions on the construction of analytic solutions in gravitational physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy and dark matter in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the behavior of interacting dark energy and dark matter within a model of $f(Q)$ gravity, employing a standard framework of dynamical system analysis. We consider the power-law $f(Q)$ model incorporating with two different forms of interacting dark energy and dark matter: $3\alpha H\rho_m$ and $\frac{\alpha}{3H}\rho_m \rho_{DE}$. The evolution of $\Omega_m, \Omega_r, \Omega_{DE}, q$, and $\omega$ for different values of the model parameter $n$ and the interaction parameter $\alpha$ has been examined. Our results show that the universe was dominated by matter in the early stages and will be dominated by dark energy in later stages. Using the observational data, the fixed points are found to be stable and can be represented the de Sitter and quintessence acceleration solutions. We discover that the dynamical profiles of the universe in $f(Q)$ dark energy models are influenced by both the interaction term and the relevant model parameters.</description>

      <title>Universal gravitational self-force for a point mass orbiting around a compact star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational back-reaction (i.e., the "self-force") of a point mass moving around a non-rotating, compact star on a circular orbit. We find that the additional self-force, comparing with the case with a point mass orbiting around a Schwarzschild black hole, can be well characterized by an universal frequency-dependent function multiplied by the (dynamical) tidal deformability of the compact star. This finding provides the foundation for building the waveform model for an extreme mass-ratio inspiral system around a star-like black hole mimicker, which is relevant for testing General Relativity and exotic compact objects with space-borne gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current observations show that a significant fraction of the Universe is composed of dark energy and dark matter. In this paper, we investigate the simultaneous effects of these dark sectors on the Euler-Heisenberg black hole, using the quintessence matter field and perfect fluid to model them. In particular, we study the black hole's thermodynamics, shadows, and quasinormal modes, and discuss in detail how these properties change with relatively large or small dark sector components.</description>

      <title>Categorical Quantum Volume Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the quantum volume operator quantifying the volume in curved three-dimensional discrete geometries. In its standard form, the quantum volume operator is constructed from tetrahedra whose faces are endowed with irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Here, we show two equivalent constructions that allow general objects in fusion categories as degrees of freedom. First, we compute the volume operator for ribbon fusion categories. This includes the important class of modular tensor categories (such as quantum doubles), which are the building blocks of anyon models. Second, we further generalize the volume operator to spherical fusion categories by relaxing the categorical analog of the closure constraint (known as tetrahedral symmetry). In both cases, we obtain a volume operator that is Hermitian, provided that the input category is unitary. As an illustrative example, we consider the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and show that the standard $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ volume operator is recovered in the limit $k\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the combined arm- and cavity-locking system for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser frequency noise suppression is a critical requirement for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission to detect gravitational waves. The baseline laser stabilization is achieved using cavity pre-stabilization and a post-processing technique called Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI). To enhance the margins for TDI, alternate laser locking schemes should be investigated. A novel stabilisation blending the excellent stability of the arm with the existing cavity reference has been shown theoretically to meet the first-generation TDI margins. This locking system was designed to be implemented as a firmware change and have minimal or no changes to the LISA hardware. This paper experimentally verifies the hybrid laser locking technique by utilizing two references - an optical cavity, and an interferometer with delay imparted using 10 km of optical fiber. The results indicate the viability of the combination of arm-cavity locking system for LISA. They show the key benefits envisioned by this technique; suppression of the cavity fluctuations by the arm sensor (by 21 dB in this demonstration) and reduction of Doppler pulling of the laser frequency, a key technical challenge for arm locking.</description>

      <title>Domain walls in light of Cosmic Microwave Background and Pulsar Timing Array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the compatibility of biased domain wall scenarios with current gravitational wave data. We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background bounds on the fractional density of gravitational waves at the time of decoupling may only slightly improve on the constraints that result from requiring that domain walls never dominate the cosmic energy budget. We show that, despite this, the range of energy scales of the domain-wall forming phase transitions are already quite constricted, even if the networks decay early in cosmological history. We also show that, if domain walls are to provide an explanation to the stochastic gravitational wave background that was recently detected by pulsar timing arrays, they not only have to decay early in the radiation dominated era but also their energy density would have to be close to dominating the energy density of the universe, which would require some fine tuning of the parameters of the models.</description>

      <title>A Note on and Generalization of "Exploring Modified Kaniadakis Entropy: MOND Theory and the Bekenstein Bound Conjecture"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Ambr\'osio et al. [arXiv:2405.14799], it was shown that the gravitational force law of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology can be derived within the framework of entropic gravity and the holographic principle by assuming an entropy function other than the conventional Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. In particular, they derived the standard interpolation function of MOND together with an analytical expression for the acceleration constant $a_0$ by utilizing Kaniadakis' modified entropy. In this short note, using the same methodology, we generalize this result and show that MONDian behavior is a rather general consequence of combining entropic gravity with non-Boltzmann-Gibbs entropies, which depends on only a few conditions imposed on the generalized entropy function.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Non-circular Deviation from the Kerr Paradigm and Its Observational Signatures: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals and Lense-Thirring Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave observations and shadow imaging have demonstrated the astonishing consistency of the Kerr paradigm despite all the special symmetries assumed in deriving the Kerr metric. Hence, it is crucial to test the presence of these symmetries in astrophysical scenarios and constraint possible deviations from them, especially in strong field regimes. With this motivation, the present work aims to investigate the theoretical consequences and observational signatures of non-circularity in a unified theory-agnostic manner. For this purpose, we construct a general non-circular metric with a small parameterized deviation from Kerr. This metric preserves all the other properties of Kerr, such as stationarity, axisymmetry, geodesic separability and asymptotic flatness. Apart from the resulting mathematical simplifications, this assumption is crucial to disentangle the consequences of relaxing circularity from other symmetries. Then, after discussing various novel mathematical properties and interesting theoretical consequences, we perform a detailed analysis of extreme mass ratio inspirals and Lense-Thirring precession in the context of this newly constructed metric. Our study clearly shows the promising prospects of detecting and constraining even a slight non-circular deviation from the Kerr paradigm using the future gravitational wave observations by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.</description>

      <title>What no one has seen before: gravitational waveforms from warp drive collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite originating in science fiction, warp drives have a concrete description in general relativity, with Alcubierre first proposing a spacetime metric that supported faster-than-light travel. Whilst there are numerous practical barriers to their implementation in real life, including a requirement for negative energy, computationally, one can simulate their evolution in time given an equation of state describing the matter. In this work, we study the signatures arising from a warp drive "containment failure", assuming a stiff equation of state for the fluid. We compute the emitted gravitational-wave signal and track the energy fluxes of the fluid. Apart from its rather speculative application to the search for extraterrestrial life in gravitational-wave detector data, this work is interesting as a study of the dynamical evolution and stability of spacetimes that violate the null energy condition. Our work highlights the importance of exploring strange new spacetimes, to (boldly) simulate what no one has seen before.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Dirac Particles and Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: The relativistic positive-energy wave equation proposed by P. Dirac in 1971 is an old but largely forgotten subject. The purpose of this note is to speculate that particles described by this equation (called here Dirac particles) are natural candidates for the dark matter. The reasoning is based on a fact that the internal structure of such particles simply prohibits their interaction with electromagnetic fields (at least with the minimal coupling) which is exactly what is required for dark matter. Dirac particles have quite unusual properties. In particular, they are transformed by an infinite-dimensional representation of the homogeneous Lorentz group, which clearly distinguishes them from all known elementary particles described by finite-dimensional representations and hints to a physics beyond the Standard Model. To clarify the topic, a brief review of the main features of {the above-mentioned} Dirac equation is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Cartan-like first-order action principle for electric Carrollian gravity. The action is invariant under the local homogeneous Carroll group, albeit in a different representation than the one obtained by gauging the Carroll algebra. Additionally, we show that this first-order action can be derived from a smooth Carrollian limit of the Einstein-Cartan action. The connection with the Hamiltonian and metric forms of the action for electric Carrollian gravity, as well as with previous works in the literature, is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What can be measured by an observer in our universe? We address this question by constructing an algebra of gravitationally-dressed observables accessible to a comoving observer in FLRW spacetimes that are asymptotically de Sitter in the past, describing an inflationary epoch. An essential quantized degree of freedom is the zero-mode of the inflaton, which leads to fluctuations in the effective cosmological constant during inflation and prevents the existence of a maximum entropy state in the semiclassical limit. Due to the inaccessibility of measurements beyond our cosmological horizon, we demonstrate that all states are mixed with well-defined von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, the von Neumann entropy corresponds to the generalized entropy (up to a state-independent constant) of the observer's causal diamond, a fine-grained quantity that is sensitive to the initial conditions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Solar chameleons: novel channels (I)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flux of chameleons (light scalar particles which could play a role in the dark energy phenomenon) produced in the interior of the Sun. Our novel analysis incorporates various important details and new processes that have previously been overlooked, including the impact of the bulk magnetic field profile, as well as Primakoff production of chameleons in the electric fields of electrons and ions. In this paper we consider only the contributions of transverse photons. The production of chameleons from longitudinal electromagnetic excitations will be presented in a dedicated follow-up work. Demanding that the total flux of chameleons does not exceed 3% of the solar luminosity leads to the stringent upper limit on the chameleon-photon conformal coupling $\beta_\gamma \lesssim 10^{10}$, assuming that the height of the chameleon potential is set to the dark energy scale $\Lambda = 2.4$ meV, and independently of other couplings to matter. Although this bound is tighter than current upper limits on $\beta_{\gamma}$ from the CAST helioscope, these limits will have to be reassessed in terms of the updated solar chameleon flux we have computed. We argue that solar chameleons, potentially detectable in next-generation helioscopes such as IAXO, can be used to probe a region of chameleon parameter space that has yet to be covered.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Reconstructed Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave High-Frequency Feature on the Nuclear Equation of State, in Real Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave (GW) predictions from five two-dimensional Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN) simulations that varied only in the Equation of State (EOS) implemented. The GW signals from these simulations are used to produce spectrograms in the absence of noise, and the emergent high-frequency feature (HFF) is found to differ quantitatively between simulations. Below 1 kHz, the HFF is well approximated by a first-order polynomial in time. The resulting slope was found to vary between 10-50% across all models. Further, using real interferometric noise we investigated the current capabilities of GW detectors to resolve these differences in HFF slope for a Galactic CCSN. We find that for distances up to 1 kpc, current detectors can resolve HFF slopes that vary by at least 30%. For further Galactic distances, current detectors are capable of distinguishing the upper and lower bounds of the HFF slope for groupings of our models that varied in EOS. With the higher sensitivity of future GW detectors, and with improved analysis of the HFF, our ability to resolve properties of the HFF will improve for all Galactic distances. This study shows the potential of using the HFF of CCSN produced GWs to provide insight into the physical processes occurring deep within CCSN during collapse, and in particular its potential to further constrain the EOS through GW detection.</description>

      <title>The quasilocal energy and thermodynamic first law in accelerating AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conserved energy of an accelerating AdS black hole by employing the quasilocal formalism, which links the off-shell ADT formalism with the off-shell covariant phase space formalism. In the presence of conical singularities in the accelerating black hole, the expression for the energy depends on the surface term derived from the variation of the action. The essential ingredient of our computations for the quasilocal energy is that the surface contributions come from the conical singularities as well as the ordinary radial boundary. Consequently, the resulting quasilocal energy naturally satisfies the thermodynamic first law for the black hole without any modifications to the thermodynamic variables. Additionally, we obtain the Smarr relation for the black hole using the differential operator method and the scaling argument of the relevant thermodynamic quantities.</description>

Abstract: Which relativistic field theories give rise to Kepler dynamics in the two-body problem? We consider a class of Hamiltonians that is the unique relativistic extension of the Kepler problem preserving its so(4) algebra, and have orbits related through time reparametrisation to orbits of the original Kepler problem. For three explicit examples, we give a natural interpretation in terms of spin-0,-1 and -2 interacting field theories in 5D. These are organically connected via the classical double copy, which therefore preserves maximal superintegrability.</description>

      <title>A clock is just a way to tell the time: gravitational algebras in cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02116v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in semiclassical quantum gravity for cosmological backgrounds, focusing on two key examples: slow-roll inflation and evaporating Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes. In both cases, we demonstrate the existence of a nontrivial algebra of diffeomorphism-invariant observables \emph{without} the introduction of an external clock system or the presence of any asymptotic gravitational charges. Instead, the rolling inflaton field and the evaporating black hole act as physical clocks that allow a definition of gauge-invariant observables at $G = 0$. The resulting algebras are both Type II$_\infty$ factors, but neither is manifestly a crossed product algebra. We establish a connection between the Type II entropy of these algebras and generalized entropies for appropriate states. Our work extends previous results on Type II gravitational algebras and highlights the crucial role of out-of-equilibrium dynamics for defining gauge-invariant observables in semiclassical canonically quantised gravity. We also briefly discuss the construction of gauge-invariant algebras for compact wedges bounded by extremal surfaces in generic spacetimes (i.e. in the absence of any Killing symmetry). In contrast to the inflaton and black hole cases, this algebra does end up being a simple crossed product. No clock or asymptotic charges are required because of the absence of any symmetry in the classical background.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. By employing a methodology to stack tracking data in combination with Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain parameter recovery tests, we show that the mission will be sensitive to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-1}$ Hz, provided that tracking data is taken consistently over a large fraction of the cruise duration. Thus, the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. Within this assumption, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(1 - 100)$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational wave backgrounds from phase transitions with next generation ground based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will operate in the $(\text{few}-10^4)$ Hz frequency band, with a boost in sensitivity providing an unprecedented reach into primordial cosmology. Working concurrently with pulsar timing arrays in the nHz band, and LISA in the mHz band, these 3G detectors will be powerful probes of beyond the standard model particle physics on scales $T\gtrsim 10^{7}$GeV. Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early universe. We first overview the landscape of detectors across frequencies, discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss their spectrum and summarise the expected constraints on these models from 3G detectors, together with SKA and LISA.</description>

Abstract: We show, both analytically and numerically, that non-Gaussian tails in the probability density function of curvature perturbations arise in ultra-slow-roll inflation from the $\delta N$ formalism, without invoking stochastic inflation. Previously reported discrepancies between both approaches are a consequence of not correctly accounting for momentum perturbations. Once they are taken into account, both approaches agree to an excellent degree. The shape of the tail depends strongly on the phase space of inflation.</description>

      <title>The Poincar\'e and BMS flux-balance laws with application to binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.03164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotically flat spacetimes admit both supertranslations and Lorentz transformations as asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, they admit super-Lorentz transformations, namely superrotations and superboosts, as outer symmetries associated with super-angular momentum and super-center-of-mass charges. In this paper, we present comprehensively the flux-balance laws for all such BMS charges. We distinguish the Poincar\'e flux-balance laws from the proper BMS flux-balance laws associated with the three relevant memory effects defined from the shear, namely, the displacement, spin and center-of-mass memory effects. We scrutinize the prescriptions used to define the angular momentum and center-of-mass. In addition, we provide the exact form of all Poincar\'e and proper BMS flux-balance laws in terms of radiative symmetric tracefree multipoles. Fluxes of energy, angular momentum and octupole super-angular momentum arise at 2.5PN, fluxes of quadrupole supermomentum arise at 3PN and fluxes of momentum, center-of-mass and octupole super-center-of-mass arise at 3.5PN. We also show that the BMS flux-balance laws lead to integro-differential consistency constraints on the radiation-reaction forces acting on the sources. Finally, we derive the exact form of all BMS charges for both an initial Kerr binary and a final Kerr black hole in an arbitrary Lorentz and supertranslation frame, which allows to derive exact constraints on gravitational waveforms produced by binary black hole mergers from each BMS flux-balance law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is largely understood to be homogeneous and isotropic, the CMB power presents anomalies that seem to break down parity symmetry at large angular scales. We argue that the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra can be parity asymmetric by considering the existence of two distinct power spectra in the two parity conjugate regions of the CMB sky without introducing any additional parameters. We impose a superselection rule to the vacuum structure for (single field) inflationary quantum fluctuations based on discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$). As a result, we estimate the amplitude of power asymmetry in the scalar and tensor sectors at different scales of $ 10^{-4} {\rm Mpc^{-1}}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. In particular, we predict the parity asymmetry for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and quantify it for different models, like Starobinsky and $\alpha-$attractors single-field inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the first model for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with misaligned angular momentum and primary spin, and zero eccentricity -- also known as quasi-spherical inspirals -- evolving under the influence of the first-order in mass ratio gravitational self-force. The forcing terms are provided by an efficient spectral interpolation of the first-order gravitational self-force in the outgoing radiation gauge. In order to speed up the calculation of the inspiral we apply a near-identity (averaging) transformation to eliminate all dependence of the orbital phases from the equations of motion while maintaining all secular effects of the first-order gravitational self-force at post-adiabatic order. The resulting solutions are defined with respect to `Mino time' so we perform a second averaging transformation so the inspiral is parametrized in terms of Boyer-Lindquist time, which is more convenient of LISA data analysis. We also perform a similar analysis using the two-timescale expansion and find that using either approach yields self-forced inspirals that can be evolved to sub-radian accuracy in less than a second. The dominant contribution to the inspiral phase comes from the adiabatic contributions and so we further refine our self-force model using information from gravitational wave flux calculations. The significant dephasing we observe between the lower and higher accuracy models highlights the importance of accurately capturing adiabatic contributions to the phase evolution.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the bulk-boundary and restricted phase space (RPS) thermodynamics of Rissner-Nordstr\"om (R-N) AdS and 6-dimensional charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes. Also, we examine the topological characteristics of the considered black holes and compare them with the extended thermodynamics results. In fact, we have found that the topological behavior of the bulk-boundary thermodynamics is the same as that of the extended thermodynamics, whereas the RPS thermodynamics exhibits a distinct behavior. We also demonstrate that within the RPS formalism, there is only one critical point with a topological charge of +1 $(Q_t=+1)$. Additionally, for RPS formalism, the inclusion of higher derivative curvature terms in the form of Gauss-Bonnet gravity does not alter the topological classification of critical points in charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Binary mergers in strong gravity background of Kerr black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers can take place close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) while being in a bound orbit around the SMBH. In this paper, we study such bound triple systems and show that including the strong gravity effects of describing the SMBH with a Kerr metric can significantly modify the dynamics, as compared to a Newtonian point particle description of the SMBH. We extract the dynamics of the system, using a quadrupole approximation to the tidal forces due to the SMBH. We exhibit how the gyroscope precession is built into this dynamics, and find the secular Hamiltonian by both averaging over the inner and outer orbits, the latter being the orbit of the BBH around the SMBH. We study the long-time-scale dynamics, including the periastron precession and GW radiation-reaction of the binary system, finding that the strong gravity effects of the SMBH can enhance the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, resulting in more cycles, higher maximum eccentricity, and thereby a shorter merger time, particularly when the binary is close to, or at, the innermost stable orbit of the SMBH. We end with an analysis of the peak frequency of the GW emission from the binary system, highlighting possible observable signatures in the LISA and ET frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Stability of Poincar\'e gauge theory with cubic order invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the vector and axial sectors of Poincar\'e gauge theory around general backgrounds in the presence of cubic order invariants defined from the curvature and torsion tensors, showing how the latter can in fact cancel out well-known instabilities arising from the quadratic curvature invariants of the theory and accordingly help in the construction of healthy models with both curvature and torsion. For this task, we introduce the most general parity preserving cubic Lagrangian with mixing terms of the curvature and torsion tensors, and find the relations of its coefficients to avoid a pathological behaviour from the vector and axial modes of torsion. As a result, on top of the gravitational constant of General Relativity and the mass parameters of torsion, our action contains 23 additional coupling constants controlling the dynamics of this field. As in the quadratic Poincar\'e gauge theory, we show that a further restriction on the cubic part of the action allows the existence of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solutions with dynamical torsion.</description>

      <title>Conservation of distortion of gravitationally lensed images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently hypothesized that a distortion parameter exists such that its signed sum for all images of singular gravitational lensing of a source vanishes identically [K. S. Virbhadra, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 106}, 064038 (2022)]. We found a distortion parameter (the ratio of the tangential to radial magnifications) that satisfied the hypothesis for the images of Schwarzschild lensing with flying colors. We now show that another distortion parameter (the difference of tangential and radial magnifications) also magnificently supports our hypothesis when we perform computations with the primary-secondary and relativistic images. The distortion parameters, which satisfy the aesthetically appealing hypothesis, will likely aid in developing gravitational lensing theory. Finally, we discuss the conservation of distortion of images in gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Multi-Metric Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a wide class of black hole solutions to the general theory of ghost free multi-metric gravity in arbitrary spacetime dimension, extending and generalising the known results in 4-dimensional dRGT massive gravity and bigravity. The solutions are split into three generic classes based on whether the metrics can be simultaneously diagonalised - one of which does not exist in dRGT massive gravity nor bigravity, and is only possible when one has more than two interacting metric fields. We also linearise the general multi-metric theory to determine the dynamics of the massive spin-2 modes, including examples where this can be done analytically, and use the linear theory to discuss the stability of the 4-dimensional multi-Schwarzchild and multi-Kerr solutions. We explain how the instabilities that plague these solutions in dRGT massive gravity and bigravity carry across to the general multi-metric theory, touching upon ideas of dimensional deconstruction to make sense of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Polynomial Affine Gravity is an alternative gravitational model, where the interactions are mediated solely by the affine connection, instead of the metric tensor. In this paper, we explore the space of solutions to the field equations when the torsion fields are turned on, in a homogeneous and isotropic (cosmological) scenario. We explore various metric structures that emerge in the space of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, combined with small inaccuracies in the estimated masses of larger asteroids, introduces timing noise for pulsars which is up to 20% of the reported signal at frequencies of ~1/(few-years). The asteroid contribution needs to be modeled better in order to obtain accurate inferences from the PTA signal.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the transitions epochs in cosmological evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two transition periods in cosmology: radiation-to-matter and matter-to-dark energy. In each case, we define a new parameter $\chi$ given by the ratios of the two energy densities involved in the transition. Our study of the second epoch is motivated by the need to understand cosmic acceleration. Assuming a dynamic dark energy is the driving force for cosmic acceleration, we formulate a new equation of state for the dark energy given in terms of the ratio $\chi$ and the deceleration parameter, $q$. We have analysed the resultant system of equations, where we vary different parameters and examine the effect on the universe's evolution. For cosmic acceleration to occur, the EoS of the dynamic dark energy must lie in the interval $\omega_{DDE}&lt;-2/3$ at matter-dynamic dark energy equality( equivalently $\omega_{DDE}&lt;-0.47$ today)</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. Localizing EMRIs by GW detectors can help us select candidate host galaxies, which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we demonstrate that the localization information can also be used to infer the formation channel of EMRIs, and hence allow us to extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions. By conducting mock observations of the EMRIs which can be detected by TianQin and LISA, as well as the galaxies which can be provided by the future Chinese Space Station Telescope, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of $\sim3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to $\sim10\%-40\%$. The TianQin+LISA network, by increasing the localization accuracy, can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to $\sim0.4\%-7\%$ and $\sim4\%-20\%$, respectively. Then, considering an illustrative case in which all EMRIs originate in AGNs, and combining the mock EMRI observation with a mock AGN catalog, we show that TianQin can recognize the EMRI-AGN correlation with $\sim 1300$ detections. The TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to $\sim 30$. Additionally, we propose a statistical method to directly estimate the fraction of EMRIs produced in AGNs, $f_{\rm agn}$, and show that observationally deriving this value could significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN surveys to improve the constraints on cosmological parameters and the formation channel of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Optimally scrambling chiral spin-chain with effective black hole geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and XCDM cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w&lt;-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w&gt;-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L&gt;1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $&gt; 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).</description>
