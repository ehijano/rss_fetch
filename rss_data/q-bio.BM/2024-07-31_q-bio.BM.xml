      <title>Antibody DomainBed: Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Therapeutic Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in accelerating drug design. Active ML-guided optimization of therapeutic molecules typically relies on a surrogate model predicting the target property of interest. The model predictions are used to determine which designs to evaluate in the lab, and the model is updated on the new measurements to inform the next cycle of decisions. A key challenge is that the experimental feedback from each cycle inspires changes in the candidate proposal or experimental protocol for the next cycle, which lead to distribution shifts. To promote robustness to these shifts, we must account for them explicitly in the model training. We apply domain generalization (DG) methods to classify the stability of interactions between an antibody and antigen across five domains defined by design cycles. Our results suggest that foundational models and ensembling improve predictive performance on out-of-distribution domains. We publicly release our codebase extending the DG benchmark ``DomainBed,'' and the associated dataset of antibody sequences and structures emulating distribution shifts across design cycles.</description>

      <title>A Vectorization Method Induced By Maximal Margin Classification For Persistent Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is an effective method for extracting topological information, represented as persistent diagrams, of spatial structure data. Hence it is well-suited for the study of protein structures. Attempts to incorporate Persistent homology in machine learning methods of protein function prediction have resulted in several techniques for vectorizing persistent diagrams. However, current vectorization methods are excessively artificial and cannot ensure the effective utilization of information or the rationality of the methods. To address this problem, we propose a more geometrical vectorization method of persistent diagrams based on maximal margin classification for Banach space, and additionaly propose a framework that utilizes topological data analysis to identify proteins with specific functions. We evaluated our vectorization method using a binary classification task on proteins and compared it with the statistical methods that exhibit the best performance among thirteen commonly used vectorization methods. The experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the statistical methods in both robustness and precision.</description>

      <title>ZeroDDI: A Zero-Shot Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction Method with Semantic Enhanced Learning and Dual-Modal Uniform Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can result in various pharmacological changes, which can be categorized into different classes known as DDI events (DDIEs). In recent years, previously unobserved/unseen DDIEs have been emerging, posing a new classification task when unseen classes have no labelled instances in the training stage, which is formulated as a zero-shot DDIE prediction (ZS-DDIE) task. However, existing computational methods are not directly applicable to ZS-DDIE, which has two primary challenges: obtaining suitable DDIE representations and handling the class imbalance issue. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method named ZeroDDI for the ZS-DDIE task. Specifically, we design a biological semantic enhanced DDIE representation learning module, which emphasizes the key biological semantics and distills discriminative molecular substructure-related semantics for DDIE representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a dual-modal uniform alignment strategy to distribute drug pair representations and DDIE semantic representations uniformly in a unit sphere and align the matched ones, which can mitigate the issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments showed that ZeroDDI surpasses the baselines and indicate that it is a promising tool for detecting unseen DDIEs. Our code has been released in https://github.com/wzy-Sarah/ZeroDDI.</description>
