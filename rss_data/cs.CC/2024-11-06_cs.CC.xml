      <title>Eulerian orientations and Hadamard codes: A novel connection via counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a novel connection between two classical mathematical notions, Eulerian orientations and Hadamard codes by studying the counting problem of Eulerian orientations (\#EO) with local constraint functions imposed on vertices. We present two special classes of constraint functions and a chain reaction algorithm, and show that the \#EO problem defined by each class alone is polynomial-time solvable by the algorithm. These tractable classes of functions are defined inductively, and quite remarkably the base level of these classes is characterized perfectly by the well-known Hadamard code. Thus, we establish a novel connection between counting Eulerian orientations and coding theory. We also prove a \#P-hardness result for the \#EO problem when constraint functions from the two tractable classes appear together.</description>

      <title>Deriving Nonuniform Lower Bounds from Uniform Nondeterministic Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proving complexity lower bounds remains a challenging task: currently, we only know how to prove conditional uniform (algorithm) lower bounds and nonuniform (circuit) lower bounds in restricted circuit models. About a decade ago, Williams (STOC 2010) showed how to derive nonuniform lower bounds from uniform \emph{upper} bounds. Since then, a number of results of this kind have been proved. For example, Jahanjou et al. (ICALP 2015) and Carmosino et al. (ITCS 2016) proved that if NSETH fails, then $\text{E}^{\text{NP}}$ has circuit size $\omega(n)$. Just recently, it was shown how uniform \emph{lower} bounds can be used to derive nonuniform lower bounds: Belova et al. (SODA 2024) showed that if MAX-3-SAT cannot be solved in co-nondeterministic time $O(2^{(1 - \varepsilon)n})$, then there exists an explicit polynomial family of high arithmetic circuit size; Williams (FOCS 2024) showed that if NSETH is true, then Boolean Inner Product requires large $\text{ETHR} \circ \text{ETHR}$ circuits. In this paper, we continue developing this line of research and show that nondeterministic uniform lower bounds imply nonuniform lower bounds for various types of objects that are notoriously hard to analyze: circuits, matrix rigidity, and tensor rank. Specifically, we prove that if NSETH is true, then there exists a monotone Boolean function family in coNP of monotone circuit size $2^{\Omega(n / \log n)}$. Combining this with the result above, we get win-win circuit lower bounds: either $\text{E}^{\text{NP}}$ requires circuits of size $w(n)$ or coNP requires monotone circuits of size $2^{\Omega(n / \log n)}$. We also prove that MAX-3-SAT cannot be solved in co-nondeterministic time $O(2^{(1 - \varepsilon)n})$, then there exist small explicit families of high rigidity matrices and high rank tensors.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy Circuits with Naturally Fault-Tolerant Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the output distribution of low-depth noisy Clifford circuits with any product-state inputs and final single-qubit measurements in any basis. This class of circuits includes Clifford-magic circuits and Conjugated-Clifford circuits, which are important candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage using non-universal gates. Additionally, our results generalize a simulation algorithm for IQP circuits [Rajakumar et. al, SODA'25] to the case of IQP circuits augmented with CNOT gates, which is another class of non-universal circuits that are relevant to current experiments. Importantly, our results do not require randomness assumptions over the circuit families considered (such as anticoncentration properties) and instead hold for \textit{every} circuit in each class. This allows us to place tight limitations on the robustness of these circuits to noise. In particular, we show that there is no quantum advantage at large depths with realistically noisy Clifford circuits, even with perfect magic state inputs, or IQP circuits with CNOT gates, even with arbitrary diagonal non-Clifford gates. The key insight behind the algorithm is that interspersed noise causes a decay of long-range entanglement, and at depths beyond a critical threshold, the noise builds up to an extent that most correlations can be classically simulated. To prove our results, we merge techniques from percolation theory with tools from Pauli path analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Computable One-Way Functions without One-Way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a classical oracle relative to which $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$ but quantum-computable quantum-secure trapdoor one-way functions exist. This is a substantial strengthening of the result of Kretschmer, Qian, Sinha, and Tal (STOC 2023), which only achieved single-copy pseudorandom quantum states relative to an oracle that collapses $\mathsf{NP}$ to $\mathsf{P}$. For example, our result implies multi-copy pseudorandom states and pseudorandom unitaries, but also classical-communication public-key encryption, signatures, and oblivious transfer schemes relative to an oracle on which $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. Hence, in our new relativized world, classical computers live in "Algorithmica" whereas quantum computers live in "Cryptomania," using the language of Impagliazzo's worlds.
  Our proof relies on a new distributional block-insensitivity lemma for $\mathsf{AC^0}$ circuits, wherein a single block is resampled from an arbitrary distribution.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal gateset for $\mathsf{QMA}_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ is $\mathsf{QMA}$ with perfect completeness, i.e., the prover must accept with a probability of exactly $1$ in the YES-case. Whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ and $\mathsf{QMA}$ are equal is still a major open problem. It is not even known whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ has a universal gateset; Solovay-Kitaev does not apply due to perfect completeness. Hence, we do not generally know whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G=\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G'}$ (superscript denoting gateset), given two universal gatesets $G,G'$. In this paper, we make progress towards the gateset question by proving that for all $k\in\mathbb N$, the gateset $G_{2^k}$ (Amy et al., RC 2024) is universal for all gatesets in the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k}),\zeta_{2^k}=e^{2\pi i/2^k}$, i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G\subseteq\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all gatesets $G$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$. For $\mathsf{BQP}_1$, we can even show that $G_2$ suffices for all $2^k$-th cyclotomic fields. We exhibit complete problems for all $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$: Quantum $l$-SAT in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ is complete for $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all $l\ge4$, and $l=3$ if $k\ge3$, where quantum $l$-SAT is the problem of deciding whether a set of $l$-local Hamiltonians has a common ground state. Additionally, we give the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete $2$-local Hamiltonian problem: It is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$-complete (for $k\ge3$) to decide whether a given $2$-local Hamiltonian $H$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ has a nonempty nullspace. Our techniques also extend to sparse Hamiltonians, and so we can prove the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1(2)$-complete (i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ with two unentangled provers) Hamiltonian problem. Finally, we prove that the Gapped Clique Homology problem defined by King and Kohler (FOCS 2024) is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_2}$-complete, and the Clique Homology problem without promise gap is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Corners in Quasirandom Groups via Sparse Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bounds on the density of corner-free sets over quasirandom groups from inverse poly-logarithmic to quasi-polynomial. We make similarly substantial improvements to the best known lower bounds on the communication complexity of a large class of permutation functions in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. Underpinning both results is a general combinatorial theorem that extends the recent work of Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC'24), itself a development of ideas from the breakthrough result of Kelley and Meka on three-term arithmetic progressions (FOCS'23).</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Lower Bounds for Approximaiton Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitivity measures how much the output of an algorithm changes, in terms of Hamming distance, when part of the input is modified. While approximation algorithms with low sensitivity have been developed for many problems, no sensitivity lower bounds were previously known for approximation algorithms. In this work, we establish the first polynomial lower bound on the sensitivity of (randomized) approximation algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) by adapting the probabilistically checkable proof (PCP) framework to preserve sensitivity lower bounds. From this, we derive polynomial sensitivity lower bounds for approximation algorithms for a variety of problems, including maximum clique, minimum vertex cover, and maximum cut.
  Given the connection between sensitivity and distributed algorithms, our sensitivity lower bounds also allow us to recover various round complexity lower bounds for distributed algorithms in the LOCAL model. Additionally, we present new lower bounds for distributed CSPs.</description>

      <title>Practical, optimal preparation of general quantum state with exponentially improved robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation, as a general process of loading classical data to quantum device, is essential for end-to-end implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, existing methods suffer from either high circuit depth or complicated hardware, limiting their practicality and robustness. In this work, we overcome these limitations with a bucket-brigade approach. The tree architectures of our hardware represents the simplest connectivity required for achieving sub-exponential circuit depth. Leveraging the bucket-brigade mechanism that can suppress the error propagation between different branches, our approach exhibit exponential improvement on the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. More specifically, the infidelity scales as $O(\text{polylog}(N))$ with data size $N$, as oppose to $O(N)$ for conventional methods. Moreover, our approach is the first to simultaneously achieve linear Clifford$+T$ circuit depth, gate count number, and space-time allocation. These advancements offer the opportunity for processing big data in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Coboundary expansion of coset complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coboundary expansion is a high dimensional generalization of the Cheeger constant to simplicial complexes. Originally, this notion was motivated by the fact that it implies topological expansion, but nowadays a significant part of the motivation stems from its deep connection to problems in theoretical computer science such as agreement expansion in the low soundness regime. In this paper, we prove coboundary expansion with non-Abelian coefficients for the coset complex construction of Kaufman and Oppenheim. Our proof uses a novel global argument, as opposed to the local-to-global arguments that are used to prove cosystolic expansion.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$, a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry. To this end, we propose the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)=\min\{\mathrm{xc}(Q)+\mathrm{xc}(R)\mid P+Q=R\}$. This generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of a neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains open to derive strong lower bounds on virtual extension complexity, we show that powerful results on the ordinary extension complexity can be converted into lower bounds for monotone neural networks, that is, neural networks with only nonnegative weights. Furthermore, we show that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation. We therefore believe that virtual extension complexity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks, just like the ordinary extension complexity. As a first step in this direction, we derive an example showing that extension complexity can go down under Minkowski sum.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Pure-State Consistency of Local Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the computational complexity of the pure consistency of local density matrices ($\mathsf{PureCLDM}$) and pure $N$-representability ($\mathsf{Pure}$-$N$-$\mathsf{Representability}$) problems. In these problems the input is a set of reduced density matrices and the task is to determine whether there exists a global \emph{pure} state consistent with these reduced density matrices. While mixed $\mathsf{CLDM}$, i.e. where the global state can be mixed, was proven to be $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete by Broadbent and Grilo [JoC 2022], almost nothing was known about the complexity of the pure version. Before our work the best upper and lower bounds were $\mathsf{QMA}(2)$ and $\mathsf{QMA}$. Our contribution to the understanding of these problems is twofold.
  Firstly, we define a pure state analogue of the complexity class $\mathsf{QMA}^+$ of Aharanov and Regev [FOCS 2003], which we call $\mathsf{PureSuperQMA}$. We prove that both $\mathsf{Pure}$-$N$-$\mathsf{Representability}$ and $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$ are complete for this new class. Along the way we supplement Broadbent and Grilo by proving hardness for 2-qubit reduced density matrices and showing that mixed $N$-$\mathsf{Representability}$ is $\mathsf{QMA}$ complete.
  Secondly, we improve the upper bound on $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$. Using methods from algebraic geometry, we prove that $\mathsf{PureSuperQMA} \subseteq \mathsf{PSPACE}$. Our methods, and the $\mathsf{PSPACE}$ upper bound, are also valid for $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$ with exponential or even perfect precision, hence $\mathsf{precisePureCLDM}$ is not $\mathsf{preciseQMA}(2) = \mathsf{NEXP}$-complete, unless $\mathsf{PSPACE} = \mathsf{NEXP}$. We view this as evidence for a negative answer to the longstanding open question whether $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$ is $\mathsf{QMA}(2)$-complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider MaxCut-type semidefinite programs (SDP) which admit a low rank solution. To numerically leverage the low rank hypothesis, a standard algorithmic approach is the Burer-Monteiro factorization, which allows to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the problem at the cost of its convexity. We give a sharp condition on the conditioning of the Laplacian matrix associated with the SDP under which any second-order critical point of the non-convex problem is a global minimizer. By applying our theorem, we improve on recent results about the correctness of the Burer-Monteiro approach on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Independent Set is a well known NP-hard optimization problem. In this work, we define a fermionic generalization of the Independent Set problem and prove that the optimization problem is QMA-hard in a $k$-particle subspace using perturbative gadgets. We discuss how the Fermionic Independent Set is related to the problem of computing the minimum eigenvalue of the $k^{\text{th}}$-Laplacian of an independence complex of a vertex weighted graph. Consequently, we use the same perturbative gadget to prove QMA-hardness of the later problem resolving an open conjecture from arXiv:2311.17234 and give the first example of a natural topological data analysis problem that is QMA-hard.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Advantage for Local Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first local problem that shows a super-constant separation between the classical randomized LOCAL model of distributed computing and its quantum counterpart. By prior work, such a separation was known only for an artificial graph problem with an inherently global definition [Le Gall et al. 2019]. We present a problem that we call iterated GHZ, which is defined using only local constraints. Formally, it is a family of locally checkable labeling problems [Naor and Stockmeyer 1995]; in particular, solutions can be verified with a constant-round distributed algorithm. We show that in graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, any classical (deterministic or randomized) LOCAL model algorithm will require $\Omega(\Delta)$ rounds to solve the iterated GHZ problem, while the problem can be solved in $1$ round in quantum-LOCAL. We use the round elimination technique to prove that the iterated GHZ problem requires $\Omega(\Delta)$ rounds for classical algorithms. This is the first work that shows that round elimination is indeed able to separate the two models, and this also demonstrates that round elimination cannot be used to prove lower bounds for quantum-LOCAL. To apply round elimination, we introduce a new technique that allows us to discover appropriate problem relaxations in a mechanical way; it turns out that this new technique extends beyond the scope of the iterated GHZ problem and can be used to e.g. reproduce prior results on maximal matchings [FOCS 2019, PODC 2020] in a systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Oblivious Defense in ML Models: Backdoor Removal without Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As society grows more reliant on machine learning, ensuring the security of machine learning systems against sophisticated attacks becomes a pressing concern. A recent result of Goldwasser, Kim, Vaikuntanathan, and Zamir (2022) shows that an adversary can plant undetectable backdoors in machine learning models, allowing the adversary to covertly control the model's behavior. Backdoors can be planted in such a way that the backdoored machine learning model is computationally indistinguishable from an honest model without backdoors.
  In this paper, we present strategies for defending against backdoors in ML models, even if they are undetectable. The key observation is that it is sometimes possible to provably mitigate or even remove backdoors without needing to detect them, using techniques inspired by the notion of random self-reducibility. This depends on properties of the ground-truth labels (chosen by nature), and not of the proposed ML model (which may be chosen by an attacker).
  We give formal definitions for secure backdoor mitigation, and proceed to show two types of results. First, we show a "global mitigation" technique, which removes all backdoors from a machine learning model under the assumption that the ground-truth labels are close to a Fourier-heavy function. Second, we consider distributions where the ground-truth labels are close to a linear or polynomial function in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, we show "local mitigation" techniques, which remove backdoors with high probability for every inputs of interest, and are computationally cheaper than global mitigation. All of our constructions are black-box, so our techniques work without needing access to the model's representation (i.e., its code or parameters). Along the way we prove a simple result for robust mean estimation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Communication Advantage in TFNP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a total search problem whose communication complexity in the quantum SMP (simultaneous message passing) model is exponentially smaller than in the classical two-way randomized model. Moreover, the quantum protocol is computationally efficient and its solutions are classically verifiable, that is, the problem lies in the communication analogue of the class TFNP. Our problem is a bipartite version of a query complexity problem recently introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (JACM 2024). We prove the classical lower bound using the structure-vs-randomness paradigm for analyzing communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 0-Valid-SAT, 1-Valid-SAT, 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, these notions differ as there are gaps, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfiable via operators on Hilbert spaces.
  We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains and give an almost complete classification: First, we show that NP-hard CSPs admit a separation between classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Second, we show that tractable CSPs of bounded width have no satisfiability gaps of any kind. Finally, we show that tractable CSPs of unbounded width can simulate, in a satisfiability-gap-preserving fashion, linear equations over an Abelian group of prime order $p$; for such CSPs, we obtain a separation of classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, if $p=2$, such CSPs also have gaps separating classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major open problem in computational complexity is the existence of a one-way function, namely a function from strings to strings which is computationally easy to compute but hard to invert. Levin (2023) formulated the notion of one-way functions from reals (infinite bit-sequences) to reals in terms of computability, and asked whether partial computable one-way functions exist. We give a strong positive answer using the hardness of the halting problem and exhibiting a total computable one-way function.</description>

      <title>Some easy optimization problems have the overlap-gap property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property in (i) sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs, shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.</description>

      <title>On the Computation of Equilibria in Discrete First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of computing Bayes-Nash equilibria in first-price auctions with discrete value distributions and discrete bidding space, under general subjective beliefs. It is known that such auctions do not always have pure equilibria. In this paper, we prove that the problem of deciding their existence is NP-complete, even for approximate equilibria. On the other hand, it can be shown that mixed equilibria are guaranteed to exist; however, their computational complexity has not been studied before. We establish the PPAD-completeness of computing a mixed equilibrium and we complement this by an efficient algorithm for finding symmetric approximate equilibria in the special case of iid priors. En route to these results, we develop a computational equivalence framework between continuous and discrete first-price auctions, which can be of independent interest, and which allows us to transfer existing positive and negative results from one setting to the other. Finally, we show that correlated equilibria of the auction can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect three distinct lines of research that have recently explored extensions of the classical LOCAL model of distributed computing: A. distributed quantum computing and non-signaling distributions [e.g. STOC 2024], B. finitely-dependent processes [e.g. Forum Math. Pi 2016], and C. locality in online graph algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms [e.g. ICALP 2023].
  We prove new results on the capabilities and limitations of all of these models of computing, for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs). We show that all these settings can be sandwiched between the classical LOCAL model and what we call the randomized online-LOCAL model. Our work implies limitations on the quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new barrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1. All LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality $O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a new barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using causality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or any of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many implications is that in rooted trees, $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in quantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in classical LOCAL.</description>

      <title>PDQMA = DQMA = NEXP: QMA With Hidden Variables and Non-collapsing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a variant of QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) in which Arthur can make multiple non-collapsing measurements to Merlin's witness state, in addition to ordinary collapsing measurements. By analogy to the class PDQP defined by Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee (2014), we call this class PDQMA. Our main result is that PDQMA = NEXP; this result builds on the PCP theorem and complements the result of Aaronson (2018) that PDQP/qpoly = ALL. While the result has little to do with quantum mechanics, we also show a more "quantum" result: namely, that QMA with the ability to inspect the entire history of a hidden variable is equal to NEXP, under mild assumptions on the hidden-variable theory. We also observe that a quantum computer, augmented with quantum advice and the ability to inspect the history of a hidden variable, can solve any decision problem in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Improved Circuit Lower Bounds and Quantum-Classical Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kumar used a switching lemma to prove exponential-size lower bounds for a circuit class GC^0 that not only contains AC^0 but can--with a single gate--compute functions that require exponential-size TC^0 circuits. His main result was that switching-lemma lower bounds for AC^0 lift to GC^0 with no loss in parameters, even though GC^0 requires exponential-size TC^0 circuits. Informally, GC^0 is AC^0 with unbounded-fan-in gates that behave arbitrarily inside a sufficiently small Hamming ball but must be constant outside it.
  We show that polynomial-method lower bounds for AC^0[p] lift to GC^0[p] with no loss in parameters, complementing Kumar's result for GC^0 and the switching lemma. As an application, we prove Majority requires depth-d GC^0[p] circuits of size $2^{\Omega(n^{1/2(d-1)})}$, matching the state-of-the-art lower bounds for AC^0[p]. We also show that E^NP requires exponential-size GCC^0 circuits (the union of GC^0[m] for all m), extending the result of Williams.
  It is striking that the switching lemma, polynomial method, and algorithmic method all generalize to GC^0-related classes, with the first two methods doing so without any loss.
  We also establish the strongest known unconditional separations between quantum and classical circuits:
  1. There's an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in the class of languages decidable by uniform families of size-$2^{n^{O(1)}}$ GC^0 circuits, generalizing Raz and Tal's relativized separation of BQP from the polynomial hierarchy.
  2. There's a search problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0 circuits.
  3. There's a search problem that QNC^0/qpoly circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits.
  4. There's an interactive problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits cannot.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms. We prove the separation for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.</description>
