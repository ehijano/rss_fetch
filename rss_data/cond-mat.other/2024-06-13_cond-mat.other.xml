      <title>Critical behavior and multistability in quasi-two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, despite being an idealization of real flows, is of fundamental interest as a model of the spontaneous emergence of order from chaotic flows. The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved. Here, we experimentally study turbulence in periodically driven nanofluidic channels with a high aspect ratio using superfluid helium. We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.</description>

      <title>Continuous time crystals as a PT symmetric state and the emergence of critical exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous time-translation symmetry is often spontaneously broken in open quantum systems, and the condition for their emergence has been actively investigated. However, there are only a few cases in which its condition for appearance has been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we show that a Lindladian parity-time (PT) symmetry can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations, including dissipative continuous time crystals, in one-collective spin models. By making an analogy to non-reciprocal phase transitions, we demonstrate that a transition point from the dynamical phase is associated with spontaneous PT symmetry breaking and typically corresponds to a \textit{critical exceptional point}. Interestingly, the periodic orbits in the PT-symmetric phase are found to be center-type, implying an initial-state-dependent amplitude. These results are established by proving that the Lindbladian PT symmetry at the microscopic level implies a non-linear PT symmetry, and by performing a linear stability analysis near the transition point. This research will further our understanding of novel non-equilibrium phases of matter and phase transitions with spontaneous anti-unitary symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of two-dimensional interacting lattice electrons using symmetry-aware neural backflow transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent ground state of quantum many-body systems, including for fermionic systems. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in Neural Slater-Backflow-Jastrow wavefunction ansatzes, and demonstrate how our model allows us to target the ground state and low-lying excited states. To capture the Hamiltonian symmetries, we introduce group-equivariant backflow transformations. We study the low-energy excitation spectrum of the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling, and find that our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves the ground-state energies, and yields accurate low-lying excited states for up to 10x10 lattices. We additionally compute the two-point density-correlation function and the structure factor to detect the phase transition and determine the critical point. Finally, we quantify the variational accuracy of our model using the V-score.</description>
