      <title>Hodge theory, intertwining functors, and the Orbit Method for real reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent representations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined classes of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator representations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all simple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge filtration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit Method. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such representations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of their $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on certain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly unipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic upgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of the affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from different localizations of the same representation. As an application of the same methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge modules on partial flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Crystal skeletons: Combinatorics and axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal skeletons were introduced by Maas-Gari\'epy in 2023 by contracting quasi-crystal components in a crystal graph. On the representation theoretic level, crystal skeletons model the expansion of Schur functions into Gessel's quasisymmetric functions. Motivated by questions of Schur positivity, we provide a combinatorial description of crystal skeletons, and prove many new properties, including a conjecture by Maas-Gari\'epy that crystal skeletons generalize dual equivalence graphs. We then present a new axiomatic approach to crystal skeletons. We give three versions of the axioms based on $GL_n$-branching, $S_n$-branching, and local axioms in analogy to the local Stembridge axioms for crystals based on novel commutation relations.</description>

      <title>Long-Moody construction of braid group representations and Haraoka's multiplicative middle convolution for KZ-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a correspondence between algebraic and analytic approaches to constructing representations of the braid group $B_n$, namely Katz-Long-Moody construction and multiplicative middle convolution for Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ)-type equations, respectively. By the left action of the braid group $B_n$ on the free group $F_n$, known as the Artin representation, the semidirect product can be defined $F_n \rtimes B_n$. The Long-Moody construction \cite{long1994constructing} provides a method to construct linear representations of $B_n$ from any given representation of $F_n \rtimes B_n$. The Katz-Long-Moody construction generalizes this approach, yielding an infinite sequence of representations of $F_n \rtimes B_n$ \cite{hiroe2023long}. On the other hand, the fundamental group of the domain of the $n$-valued KZ-type equation is isomorphic to the pure braid group $P_n$. The multiplicative middle convolution for the KZ-type equation provides an antirepresentation of $P_n$, derived from a given antirepresentation of $P_n$ \cite{haraoka2020multiplicative}. Furthermore, we show that this construction preserves unitarity relative to a Hermitian matrix $\widetilde{H}_{\widetilde{p}, \widetilde{q}}$, and established an algorithm to determine the signature of the Hermitian matrix $\widetilde{H}_{\widetilde{p}, \widetilde{q}}$.</description>

      <title>Sken and cluster algebras of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the full Fock-Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$--the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety associated to representation of $SL_2$ local systems on most punctured surfaces with at least 2 punctures in the classical $q\to 1$ setting, that is, the tagged skein algebra coincides with the upper cluster algebra (namely $Sk^{ta}=U(\Sigma)$ or $mid(\mathcal{A})=up(\mathcal{A})$), with methods being potentially useful to tackle the quantum case. We deduce similar results for the Roger Yang skein algebra via a birational geometric description, obtaining $Sk^{RY}=U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$ as conjectured by Shen, Sun and Weng, proving important algebraic properties of $Sk^{RY}$ including normality and Cohen-Macaulayness. Our result is complementary to what and Mandel and Qin have shown in arXiv:2301.11101 for surface with marked points, based on arXiv:1411.1394 . The once-punctured case where cluster structures are significantly different is also discussed in the paper, and relevant conjectures are proposed (and proved in the once-punctured torus case).
  By contrast, we define the ordinary cluster algebra with potentials added $A(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$, introduced by Shen, Sun and Weng, which is shown to be usually smaller than $Sk^{RY}$ and $U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$. This strengthen the result of arXiv:2201.08833 that the classical $A=U$ fails for $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with $g\geq 1, p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Gluing invariants of Donaldson--Thomas type -- Part II: Matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up to arXiv:2407.08471. Let $X$ be a a $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived Deligne--Mumford stack. Thanks to the Darboux lemma of Brav--Bussi--Joyce, $X$ is locally modeled by derived critical loci of a function $f$ on a smooth scheme $U$. In this paper we study the gluing of the locally defined $2$-periodic (big) dg-categories of matrix factorizations $MF^\infty(U,f)$. We show that these come canonically equipped with a structure of a $2$-periodic crystal of categories (\ie an action of the dg-category of $2$-periodic $D$-modules on $X$) compatible with a relative Thom--Sebastiani theorem expressing the equivariance under the action of quadratic bundles.
  As our main theorem we show that the locally defined categories $MF^\infty(U,f)$ can be glued along $X$ as a sheaf of crystals of 2-periodic dg-categories ``up to isotopy'', under the prescription of orientation data controlled by three obstruction classes. This result generalizes the gluing of the Joyce's perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles and partially answers conjectures by Kontsevich--Soibelman and Toda in motivic Donaldson--Thomas theory.</description>

We show that there does not exist a compatible root graded anti-pre-Lie algebraic structure on a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra except ${\rm sl_2(\C)}$, whereas there is exactly one compatible root graded anti-pre-Lie algebraic structure on ${\rm sl_2(\C)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of a tensor-triangulated category carries a compact Hausdorff topology, called the constructible topology, also known as the patch topology. We prove that patch-dense subsets detect tt-ideals and we prove that any infinite family of tt-functors that detects nilpotence provides such a patch-dense subset. We review several applications and examples in algebra, in topology and in the representation theory of profinite groups.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of elements in the nilradical of a parabolic subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ with a specified Jordan form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a composition of $n$, and let $\mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ denote the nilradical of the standard parabolic subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ associated with $\Lambda$. Using a parabolic variation of Borodin's division algorithm we prove that, up to an explicit polynomial factor in $q$, the number of elements in $\mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ of Jordan type $\mu$ is equal to the coefficient of the monomial $\mathbf x^\Lambda$ in the specialization of the dual Macdonald polynomial $\mathrm Q_{\mu'}(\mathbf x;q^{-1},t)$ at $t=0$. Our proof is shorter and more direct than the one given by Karp and Thomas.
  We give three applications of the above theorem. First, we demonstrate that a recurrence relation of Kirillov for the number of strictly upper triangular matrices of Jordan type $\mu$ is a straightforward consequence of the above result combined with the Cauchy identity for Macdonald polynomials. Second, we give an explicit formula for the number of $X\in \mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ that satisfy $X^2=0$. In the special case $\Lambda=(1^n)$, our formula is different from the one conjectured by Kirillov and Melnikov (which was proved by Ekhad and Zeilberger). We obtain a new proof of the Kirillov-Melnikov-Ekhad-Zeilberger formula using our latter result and a formula for two-rowed Macdonald polynomials by Jing and J\'{o}zefiak. Third, we compute the number of double cosets $\mathsf U_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)\backslash\mathsf{GL}_n(\mathbb F_q)/\mathsf U_\Gamma(\mathbb F_q)$ where $\mathsf U_\Lambda$ and $\mathsf U_\Gamma$ denote unipotent radicals of the standard parabolics of $\mathsf{GL}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ associated to compositions $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ of $n$.</description>

      <title>Quantized Coulomb branch of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory and spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study BPS loop operators in a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation. The algebra of BPS loop operators in the $\Omega$-background provides a deformation quantization of the Coulomb branch, which is expected to coincide with the quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branch in the mathematical literature. For the rank-one case, i.e., $Sp(1) \simeq SU(2)$, we show that the quantization of the Coulomb branch, evaluated using the supersymmetric localization formula, agrees with the polynomial representation of the spherical part of the double affine Hecke algebra (spherical DAHA) of $(C_1^{\vee}, C_1)$-type. For higher-rank cases, where $N \geq 2$, we conjecture that the quantized Coulomb branch of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory is isomorphic to the spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type . As evidence for this conjecture, we demonstrate that the quantization of an 't Hooft loop agrees with the Koornwinder operator in the polynomial representation of the spherical DAHA.</description>

      <title>On the action of the symmetric group on the free LAnKe: a question of Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A LAnKe (also known as a Lie algebra of the $n$th kind, or a Filippov algebra) is a vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric $n$-linear form that satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity. The symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_m$ acts on the multilinear part of the free LAnKe on $m=(n-1)k+1$ generators, where $k$ is the number of brackets, by permutation of the generators. The corresponding representation was studied by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs, who asked whether for $n \ge k$, its irreducible decomposition contains no summand whose Young diagram has at most $k-1$ columns. The answer is affirmative if $k \le 3$. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative for all $k$. A proof has been given recently by Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs. The two proofs are completely different.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a uniform approach to obtain sufficient criteria for a (higher order) fixed point of a given bracket structure on a manifold to be stable under deformations. Examples of bracket structures include Lie algebroids, Lie $n$-algebroids, singular foliations, Lie bialgebroids, Courant algebroids and Dirac structures in split Courant algebroids admitting a Dirac complement. We show that the stability problems are specific instances of the following problem: given a differential graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, a differential graded Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak h$ of degreewise finite codimension in $\mathfrak g$ and a Maurer-Cartan element $Q\in \mathfrak h^1$, when are Maurer-Cartan elements near $Q$ in $\mathfrak g$ gauge equivalent to elements of $\mathfrak h^1$? We show that the vanishing of a finite-dimensional cohomology group associated to $\mathfrak g,\mathfrak h$ and $Q$ implies a positive answer to the question above, and therefore implies stability of fixed points of the geometric structures described above. In particular, we recover the stability results of Crainic-Fernandes for zero-dimensional leaves, as well as the stability results for higher order singularities of Dufour-Wade.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense discontinuous surface groups for reductive symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G/H$ be a homogeneous space of reductive type with non-compact $H$. The study of deformations of discontinuous groups for $G/H$ was initiated by T.~Kobayashi. In this paper, we show that a standard discontinuous group $\Gamma$ admits a non-standard small deformation as a discontinuous group for $G/H$ if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to a surface group of high genus and its Zariski closure is locally isomorphic to $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. Furthermore, we also prove that if $G/H$ is a symmetric space and admits some non virtually abelian discontinuous groups, then $G$ contains a Zariski-dense discrete surface subgroup of high genus acting properly discontinuously on $G/H$. As a key part of our proofs, we show that for a discrete surface subgroup $\Gamma$ of high genus contained in a reductive group $G$, if the Zariski closure of $\Gamma$ is locally isomorphic to $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, then $\Gamma$ admits a small deformation in $G$ whose Zariski closure is a reductive subgroup of the same real rank as $G$.</description>

We formulate a Wiener's Tauberian theorem, and characterizations of the radial Toeplitz algebra over $\mathcal{A}^2(\mathbb{B}^n)$. We discuss the $\alpha$-Berezin transform and investigate the question of approximations by Toeplitz operators.</description>
