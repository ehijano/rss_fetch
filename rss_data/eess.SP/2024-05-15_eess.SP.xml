      <title>Radio Resource Management and Path Planning in Intelligent Transportation Systems via Reinforcement Learning for Environmental Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and dynamic path planning has become an important topic for urban areas with larger density of connected vehicles (CV) which results in reduction of travel time and directly contributes to environmental sustainability through reducing energy consumption. CVs exploit the cellular wireless vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology to disseminate the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) messages to the Base-station (BS) to improve situation awareness on urban roads. In this paper, we investigate radio resource management (RRM) in such a framework to minimize the age of information (AoI) so as to enhance path planning results. We use the fact that V2I messages with lower AoI value result in less error in estimating the road capacity and more accurate path planning. Through simulations, we compare road travel times and volume over capacity (V/C) against different levels of AoI and demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Show Me the Way: Real-Time Tracking of Wireless Mobile Users with UWB-Enabled RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in 6G wireless networks offers unprecedented control over communication environments. However, identifying optimal configurations within practical constraints remains a significant challenge. This becomes especially pronounced, when the user is mobile and the configurations need to be deployed in real time. Leveraging Ultra-Wideband (UWB) as localization technique, we capture and analyze real-time movements of a user within the RIS-enabled indoor environment. Given this information about the system's geometry, a model-based optimization is utilized, which enables real-time beam steering of the RIS towards the user. However, practical limitations of UWB modules lead to fluctuating UWB estimates, causing the RIS beam to occasionally miss the tracked user. The methodologies proposed in this work aim to increase the compatibility between these two systems. To this end, we provide two key solutions: beam splitting for obtaining more robust RIS configurations and UWB estimation correction for reducing the variations in the UWB data. Through comprehensive theoretical and experimental evaluations in both stationary and mobile scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated. When combined, the proposed methods improve worst-case tracking performance by a significant 17.5dB compared to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Rate Splitting Grouping for Antifragile Responses to Wireless Network Disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliance on wireless network architectures for applications demanding high reliability and fault tolerance is growing. These architectures heavily depend on wireless channels, making them susceptible to impairments and blockages. Ensuring functionality, particularly for safety-critical applications, demands robust countermeasures at the physical layer. In response, this work proposes the utilization of a dynamic Rate Splitting (RS) grouping approach as a resilience mechanism during blockages. RS effectively manages interference within networks but faces challenges during outages and blockages, where system performance can deteriorate due to the lowest decoding rate dictating the common rate and increased interference from fewer available channel links. As a strategic countermeasure, RS is leveraged to mitigate the impact of blockages, maintaining system efficiency and performance amidst disruptions. In fact, the introduction of new RS groups enables the exploration of novel solutions to the resource allocation problem, potentially outperforming those adopted before the occurrence of a blockage. As it turns out, by employing the dynamic RS grouping, the network exhibits an antifragile recovery response, showcasing the network's ability to not only recover from disruptions but also surpass its initial performance.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing Modulation with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing(ODDM) modulation has been recently proposed as a promising modulation scheme for next-generation communication systems with high mobility. Despite its benefits, ODDM modulation and other DD domain modulation schemes face the challenge of excessive equalization complexity. To address this challenge, we propose time domain Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) for the ODDM transmitter, to make the DD domain single-tap equalizer feasible, thereby reducing the equalization complexity. In our design, we first pre-cancel the inter-symbolinterference (ISI) using the linear time-varying (LTV) channel information. Second, different from classical THP designs, we introduce a modified modulo operation with an adaptive modulus, by which the joint DD domain data multiplexing and timedomain ISI pre-cancellation can be realized without excessively increasing the bit errors. We then analytically study the losses encountered in this design, namely the power loss, the modulo noise loss, and the modulo signal loss. Based on this analysis, BER lower bounds of the ODDM system with time domain THP are derived when 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations are adopted for symbol mapping in the DD domain. Finally, through numerical results, we validate our analysis and then demonstrate that the ODDM system with time domain THP is a promising solution to realize better BER performance over LTV channels compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems with single-tap equalizer and ODDM systems with maximum ratio combining.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Event-Frame Neural Spike Detector for Neuromorphic Implantable BMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces two novel neural spike detection schemes intended for use in next-generation neuromorphic brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). The first, an Event-based Spike Detector (Ev-SPD) which examines the temporal neighborhood of a neural event for spike detection, is designed for in-vivo processing and offers high sensitivity and decent accuracy (94-97%). The second, Neural Network-based Spike Detector (NN-SPD) which operates on hybrid temporal event frames, provides an off-implant solution using shallow neural networks with impressive detection accuracy (96-99%) and minimal false detections. These methods are evaluated using a synthetic dataset with varying noise levels and validated through comparison with ground truth data. The results highlight their potential in next-gen neuromorphic iBMI systems and emphasize the need to explore this direction further to understand their resource-efficient and high-performance capabilities for practical iBMI settings.</description>

      <title>A Low-Power Spike Detector Using In-Memory Computing for Event-based Neural Frontend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the sensor scaling of next-generation Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) systems, the massive A/D conversion and analog multiplexing at the neural frontend poses a challenge in terms of power and data rates for wireless and implantable BMIs. While previous works have reported the neuromorphic compression of neural signal, further compression requires integration of spike detectors on chip. In this work, we propose an efficient HRAM-based spike detector using In-memory computing for compressive event-based neural frontend. Our proposed method involves detecting spikes from event pulses without reconstructing the signal and uses a 10T hybrid in-memory computing bitcell for the accumulation and thresholding operations. We show that our method ensures a spike detection accuracy of 92-99% for neural signal inputs while consuming only 13.8 nW per channel in 65 nm CMOS.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing of Side Lobes Interference for mmWave Blockages Localization and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio localization and sensing are anticipated to play a crucial role in enhancing radio resource management in future networks. In this work, we focus on millimeter-wave communications, which are highly vulnerable to blockages, leading to severe attenuation and performance degradation. In a previous work, we proposed a novel mechanism that senses the radio environment to estimate the angular position of a moving blocker with respect to the sensing node. Building upon this foundation, this paper investigates the benefits of cooperation between different entities in the network by sharing sensed data to jointly locate the moving blocker while mapping the interference profile to probe the radio environment. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that cooperative sensing can achieve a more precise location estimation of the blocker as it further allows accurate estimation of its distance rather than its relative angular position only, leading to effective assessment of the blocker direction, trajectory and possibly, its speed, and size.</description>

      <title>Design of a Multi-User RIS-Aided System with Statistical Channel Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology to enhance the spectral and energy efficiency in a wireless communication system. The design of the phase shifts of an RIS in every channel coherence interval demands a huge training overhead, making its deployment practically infeasible. The design complexity can be significantly reduced by exploiting the second-order statistics of the channels. This paper is the extension of our previous work to the design of an RIS for the multi-user setup, where we employ maximisation of the lower bound of the achievable sum-rate of the users. Unlike for the single-user case, obtaining a closed-form expression for the update of the filters and phase shifts is more challenging in the multi-user case. We resort to the fractional programming (FP) approach and the non-convex block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the optimisation problem. As the phase shifts of the RIS obtained by the proposed algorithms are based on the statistical channel knowledge, they do not need to be updated in every channel coherence interval.</description>

      <title>FDD Massive MIMO: How to Optimally Combine UL Pilot and Limited DL CSI Feedback?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In frequency-division duplexing (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, obtaining accurate downlink channel state information (CSI) for precoding is vastly challenging due to the tremendous feedback overhead with the growing number of antennas. Utilizing uplink pilots for downlink CSI estimation is a promising approach that can eliminate CSI feedback. However, the downlink CSI estimation accuracy diminishes significantly as the number of channel paths increases, resulting in reduced spectral efficiency. In this paper, we demonstrate that achieving downlink spectral efficiency comparable to perfect CSI is feasible by combining uplink CSI with limited downlink CSI feedback information. Our proposed downlink CSI feedback strategy transmits quantized phase information of downlink channel paths, deviating from conventional limited methods. We put forth a mean square error (MSE)-optimal downlink channel reconstruction method by jointly exploiting the uplink CSI and the limited downlink CSI. Armed with the MSE-optimal estimator, we derive the MSE as a function of the number of feedback bits for phase quantization. Subsequently, we present an optimal feedback bit allocation method for minimizing the MSE in the reconstructed channel through phase quantization. Utilizing a robust downlink precoding technique, we establish that the proposed downlink channel reconstruction method is sufficient for attaining a sum-spectral efficiency comparable to perfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Bandwidth Estimation from Level-Crossing Samples via LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for instantaneous bandwidth estimation from level-crossing samples using a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder architecture. Level-crossing sampling is a nonuniform sampling technique that is particularly useful for energy-efficient acquisition of signals with sparse spectra. Especially in combination with fully analog wireless sensor nodes, level-crossing sampling offers a viable alternative to traditional sampling methods. However, due to the nonuniform distribution of samples, reconstructing the original signal is a challenging task. One promising reconstruction approach is time-warping, where the local signal spectrum is taken into account. However, this requires an accurate estimate of the instantaneous bandwidth of the signal. In this paper, we show that applying neural networks (NNs) to the problem of estimating instantaneous bandwidth from level-crossing samples can improve the overall reconstruction accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis of the proposed approach and compare it to an intensity-based bandwidth estimation method from literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to time series forecasting, leveraging their adaptive activation functions for enhanced predictive modeling. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs replace traditional linear weights with spline-parametrized univariate functions, allowing them to learn activation patterns dynamically. We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>Do Bayesian imaging methods report trustworthy probabilities?</title>

Abstract: Bayesian statistics is a cornerstone of imaging sciences, underpinning many and varied approaches from Markov random fields to score-based denoising diffusion models. In addition to powerful image estimation methods, the Bayesian paradigm also provides a framework for uncertainty quantification and for using image data as quantitative evidence. These probabilistic capabilities are important for the rigorous interpretation of experimental results and for robust interfacing of quantitative imaging pipelines with scientific and decision-making processes. However, are the probabilities delivered by existing Bayesian imaging methods meaningful under replication of an experiment, or are they only meaningful as subjective measures of belief? This paper presents a Monte Carlo method to explore this question. We then leverage the proposed Monte Carlo method and run a large experiment requiring 1,000 GPU-hours to probe the accuracy of five canonical Bayesian imaging methods that are representative of some of the main Bayesian imaging strategies from the past decades (a score-based denoising diffusion technique, a plug-and-play Langevin algorithm utilising a Lipschitz-regularised DnCNN denoiser, a Bayesian method with a dictionary-based prior trained subject to a log-concavity constraint, an empirical Bayesian method with a total-variation prior, and a hierarchical Bayesian Gibbs sampler based on a Gaussian Markov random field model). We find that, a few cases, the probabilities reported by modern Bayesian imaging techniques are in broad agreement with long-term averages as observed over a large number of replication of an experiment, but existing Bayesian imaging methods are generally not able to deliver reliable uncertainty quantification results.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Time-varying Wireless Communication Channel with Fading and Shadowing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time quantification of the effect of a wireless channel on the transmitting signal is crucial for the analysis and the intelligent design of wireless communication systems for various services. Recent mechanisms to model channel characteristics independent of coding, modulation, signal processing, etc., using deep learning neural networks are promising solutions. However, the current approaches are neither statistically accurate nor able to adapt to the changing environment. In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines a deep learning neural network with a mixture density network model to derive the conditional probability density function (PDF) of receiving power given a communication distance in general wireless communication systems. Furthermore, a deep transfer learning scheme is designed and implemented to allow the channel model to dynamically adapt to changes in communication environments. Extensive experiments on Nakagami fading channel model and Log-normal shadowing channel model with path loss and noise show that the new approach is more statistically accurate, faster, and more robust than the previous deep learning-based channel models.</description>

      <title>EEG-Features for Generalized Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of Deepfakes in digital media, the development of robust and reliable detection mechanism is urgently called for. In this study, we explore a novel approach to Deepfake detection by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) measured from the neural processing of a human participant who viewed and categorized Deepfake stimuli from the FaceForensics++ datset. These measurements serve as input features to a binary support vector classifier, trained to discriminate between real and manipulated facial images. We examine whether EEG data can inform Deepfake detection and also if it can provide a generalized representation capable of identifying Deepfakes beyond the training domain. Our preliminary results indicate that human neural processing signals can be successfully integrated into Deepfake detection frameworks and hint at the potential for a generalized neural representation of artifacts in computer generated faces. Moreover, our study provides next steps towards the understanding of how digital realism is embedded in the human cognitive system, possibly enabling the development of more realistic digital avatars in the future.</description>

Abstract: The International Telecommunication Union defined the requirements for 5G in the International Mobile Telecommunications 2020 (IMT-2020) standard in 2017. Since then, advances in technology and standardization have made the ubiquitous deployment of 5G via satellite a practical possibility, for example, in locations where terrestrial networks (TNs) are not available. However, it may be difficult for satellite networks to achieve the same performance as TNs. To address this, the IMT-2020 requirements for satellite radio interface technology have recently been established. In this paper, these requirements are evaluated through system simulations for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project New Radio non-terrestrial networks with a low Earth orbit satellite. The focus is on the throughput, area traffic capacity, and spectral efficiency requirements. It is observed that the downlink (DL) requirements can be met for user equipment with 2 receive antenna elements. The results also reveal that frequency reuse factor 1 (FRF1) may outperform FRF3 in DL with a dual-antenna setup, which is a surprising finding since FRF3 is typically considered to outperform FRF1 due to better interference reduction. For uplink (UL), 1 transmit antenna is sufficient to meet the requirements by a relatively large margin - a promising result given that UL is generally more demanding.</description>

      <title>TAnet: A New Temporal Attention Network for EEG-based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding with a Short Decision Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) is used to determine the direction of a listener's attention to a speaker by analyzing her/his electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This study aimed to further improve the performance of ASAD with a short decision window (i.e., &lt;1 s) rather than with long decision windows ranging from 1 to 5 seconds in previous studies. An end-to-end temporal attention network (i.e., TAnet) was introduced in this work. TAnet employs a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, which can more effectively capture the interactions among time steps in collected EEG signals and efficiently assign corresponding weights to those EEG time steps. Experiments demonstrated that, compared with the CNN-based method and recent ASAD methods, TAnet provided improved decoding performance in the KUL dataset, with decoding accuracies of 92.4% (decision window 0.1 s), 94.9% (0.25 s), 95.1% (0.3 s), 95.4% (0.4 s), and 95.5% (0.5 s) with short decision windows (i.e., &lt;1 s). As a new ASAD model with a short decision window, TAnet can potentially facilitate the design of EEG-controlled intelligent hearing aids and sound recognition systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous neural activity, crucial in memory, learning, and spatial navigation, often manifests itself as repetitive spatiotemporal patterns. Despite their importance, analyzing these patterns in large neural recordings remains challenging due to a lack of efficient and scalable detection methods. Addressing this gap, we introduce convSeq, an unsupervised method that employs backpropagation for optimizing spatiotemporal filters that effectively identify these neural patterns. Our method's performance is validated on various synthetic data and real neural recordings, revealing spike sequences with unprecedented scalability and efficiency. Significantly surpassing existing methods in speed, convSeq sets a new standard for analyzing spontaneous neural activity, potentially advancing our understanding of information processing in neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Mental Stress Detection: Development and Evaluation of a Wearable In-Ear Plethysmography</title>

Abstract: Mental stress is a prevalent condition that can have negative impacts on one's health. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing related illnesses and maintaining overall wellness. This study presents a new method for identifying mental stress using a wearable biosensor worn in the ear. Data was gathered from 14 participants in a controlled environment using stress-inducing tasks such as memory and math tests. The raw photoplethysmography data was then processed by filtering, segmenting, and transforming it into scalograms using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) which are based on two different mother wavelets, namely, a generalized Morse wavelet and the analytic Morlet (Gabor) wavelet. The scalograms were then passed through a convolutional neural network classifier, GoogLeNet, to classify the signals as stressed or non-stressed. The method achieved an outstanding result using the generalized Morse wavelet with an accuracy of 91.02% and an F1-score of 90.95%. This method demonstrates promise as a reliable tool for early detection and treatment of mental stress by providing real-time monitoring and allowing for preventive measures to be taken before it becomes a serious issue.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security with Deep SIMO Auto-Encoder and RF Impairments Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to achieving secure wireless communication by leveraging the inherent characteristics of wireless channels through end-to-end learning using a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) autoencoder (AE). To ensure a more realistic signal transmission, we derive the signal model that captures all radio frequency (RF) hardware impairments to provide reliable and secure communication. Performance evaluations against traditional linear decoders, such as zero-forcing (ZR) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and the optimal nonlinear decoder, maximum likelihood (ML), demonstrate that the AE-based SIMO model exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance, but with a substantial gap even in the presence of RF hardware impairments. Additionally, the proposed model offers enhanced security features, preventing potential eavesdroppers from intercepting transmitted information and leveraging RF impairments for augmented physical layer security and device identification. These findings underscore the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end learning approach in achieving secure and robust wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Multipath-based SLAM with Cooperation and Map Fusion in MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach in wireless networks for obtaining position information of transmitters and receivers as well as information on the propagation environment. MP-SLAM models specular reflections of radio frequency (RF) signals at flat surfaces as virtual anchors (VAs), the mirror images of base stations (BSs). Conventional methods for MP-SLAM consider a single mobile terminal (MT) which has to be localized. The availability of additional MTs paves the way for utilizing additional information in the scenario. Specifically enabling MTs to exchange information allows for data fusion over different observations of VAs made by different MTs. Furthermore, cooperative localization becomes possible in addition to multipathbased localization. Utilizing this additional information enables more robust mapping and higher localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Informed Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the matrix completion problem, where the objective is to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a few observed entries. A commonly employed approach involves nuclear norm minimization. For this method to succeed, the number of observed entries needs to scale at least proportional to both the rank of the ground-truth matrix and the coherence parameter. While the only prior information is oftentimes the low-rank nature of the ground-truth matrix, in various real-world scenarios, additional knowledge about the ground-truth low-rank matrix is available. For instance, in collaborative filtering, Netflix problem, and dynamic channel estimation in wireless communications, we have partial or full knowledge about the signal subspace in advance. Specifically, we are aware of some subspaces that form multiple angles with the column and row spaces of the ground-truth matrix. Leveraging this valuable information has the potential to significantly reduce the required number of observations. To this end, we introduce a multi-weight nuclear norm optimization problem that concurrently promotes the low-rank property as well the information about the available subspaces. The proposed weights are tailored to penalize each angle corresponding to each basis of the prior subspace independently. We further propose an optimal weight selection strategy by minimizing the coherence parameter of the ground-truth matrix, which is equivalent to minimizing the required number of observations. Simulation results validate the advantages of incorporating multiple weights in the completion procedure. Specifically, our proposed multi-weight optimization problem demonstrates a substantial reduction in the required number of observations compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CLASH: Contrastive learning through alignment shifting to extract stimulus information from EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stimulus-evoked EEG data has a notoriously low signal-to-noise ratio and high inter-subject variability. We propose a novel paradigm for the self-supervised extraction of stimulus-related brain response data: a model is trained to extract similar information between two time-aligned segments of EEG in response to the same stimulus. The extracted information can subsequently be used to obtain better results in downstream tasks that utilize the response to the stimulus. We show the efficacy of our method for a downstream task of decoding the speech envelope from auditory EEG. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art denoising techniques, improving reconstruction scores by 45\%. Additionally, we show that in contrast to the baseline denoising techniques, our method can be used with data of unseen subjects and stimuli without retraining, improving decoding performance by 19\% and 34\% over raw EEG for two holdout datasets. Finally, the last experiment reveals that the accuracies obtained in the CLASH paradigm are significantly correlated with the percentile of obtained reconstruction correlation on the null distribution. In general, we showed that the proposed paradigm is suitable to train deep learning models to extract stimulus information from EEG while being stimulus feature agnostic.</description>

      <title>GeNet: A Graph Neural Network-based Anti-noise Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic communication tasks rely on the knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to mitigate channel noise. Moreover, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</description>
