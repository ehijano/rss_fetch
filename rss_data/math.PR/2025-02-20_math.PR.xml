      <title>Path-Distribution Dependent SDEs: Well-Posedness and Asymptotic Log-Harnack Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic different equations on $\mathbb R^d$ with coefficients depending on the path and distribution for the whole history. Under a local integrability condition on the time-spatial singular drift, the well-posedness and Lipschitz continuity in initial values are proved, which is new even in the distribution independent case. Moreover, under a monotone condition, the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality is established, which extends the corresponding result of [5] derived in the distribution independent case.</description>

      <title>On limiting distributions of Graham, Knuth, Patashnik recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graham, Knuth and Patashnik in their book Concrete Mathematics called for development of a general theory of the solutions of recurrences defined by $$\left|{ n\atop k}\right|=(\alpha n+\beta k+\gamma)\left|{n-1\atop k}\right|+(\alpha' n+\beta' k+\gamma')\left|{n-1\atop k-1}\right|+I_{n=k=0}$$ for $0\le k\le n$ and six parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\alpha'\beta',\gamma'$. Since then, a number of authors investigated various properties of the solutions of these recurrences. In this note we consider a probabilistic aspect, namely we consider the limiting distributions of sequences of integer valued random variables naturally associated with the solutions of such recurrences. We will give a complete description of the limiting behavior when $\alpha'=0$ and the remaining five parameters are non--negative.</description>

      <title>Criteria for asymptotic stability of eventually continuous Markov-Feller semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish three criteria for the asymptotic behavior of Markov-Feller semigroups. First, we present a criterion for convergence in total variation to a unique invariant measure, requiring only $B_b$-eventual continuity of the semigroup at a single point. Second, we propose two new criteria for asymptotic stability that require eventual continuity at a single point. This localized condition is more practical and easier to check. To illustrate the advantages of our framework, we provide an explicit example where verifying eventual continuity at a single point is straightforward, whereas establishing the corresponding global property is challenging.</description>

      <title>Stochastic tamed 3D Navier-Stokes equations with locally weak monotonicity coefficients: existence, uniqueness and averaging principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic tamed 3D Navier-Stokes equations with locally weak monotonicity coefficients in the whole space as well as in the three-dimensional torus, which play a crucial role in turbulent flows analysis. A significant issue is addressed in this work, specifically, the reduced regularity of the coefficients and the inapplicability of Gronwall's lemma complicates the establishment of pathwise uniqueness for weak solutions. Initially, the existence of a martingale solution for the system is established via Galerkin approximation; thereafter, the pathwise uniqueness of this martingale solution is confirmed by constructing a specialized control function. Ultimately, the Yamada-Watanabe theorem is employed to establish the existence and uniqueness of the strong solution to the system. Furthermore, an averaging principle, referred to as the first Bogolyubov theorem, is established for stochastic tamed 3D Navier-Stokes equations with highly oscillating components, where the coefficients satisfy the assumptions of linear growth and locally weak monotonicity. This result is achieved using classical Khasminskii time discretization, which illustrates the convergence of the solution from the original Cauchy problem to the averaged equation over a finite interval [0, T].</description>

      <title>Simplicity of singular value spectrum of random matrices and two-point quantitative invertibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ random matrix with independent, identically distributed mean 0, variance 1 subgaussian entries. We prove that $$ \mathbb{P}(A\text{ has distinct singular values})\geq 1-e^{-cn} $$ for some $c&gt;0$, confirming a conjecture of Vu. This result is then generalized to singular values of rectangular random matrices with i.i.d. entries.
  We also prove that for two fixed real numbers $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ with a sufficient lower bound on $|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|$, we have a joint singular value small ball estimate for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ $$ \mathbb{P}(\sigma_{min}(A-\lambda_1I_n)\leq\epsilon n^{-1/2},\sigma_{min}(A-\lambda_2I_n)\leq\epsilon n^{-1/2})\leq C\epsilon^2+e^{-cn}, $$ where $\sigma_{min}(A)$ is the minimal singular value of a square matrix $A$ and $I_n$ is the identity matrix. For much smaller $|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|$ we derive a similar estimate with $C$ replaced by $C\sqrt{n}/|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|$. This generalizes the one-point estimate of Rudelson and Vershynin, which proves $\mathbb{P}(\sigma_{min}(A)\leq \epsilon n^{-1/2})\leq C\epsilon+e^{-cn}$. Analogous two-point bounds are proven when $A$ has i.i.d. real and complex parts, with $\epsilon^4$ in place of $\epsilon^2$ on the right hand side of the estimate and for any complex numbers $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$. These two point estimates can be used to derive strong anticoncentration bounds for an arbitrary linear combination of two eigenvalues of $A$.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Product Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product-form stationary distributions in Markov chains have been a foundational advance and driving force in our understanding of stochastic systems. In this paper, we introduce a new product-form relationship that we call "graph-based product-form". As our first main contribution, we prove that two states of the Markov chain are in graph-based product form if and only if the following two equivalent conditions are satisfied: (i) a cut-based condition, reminiscent of classical results on product-form queueing systems, and (ii) a novel characterization that we call joint-ancestor freeness. The latter characterization allows us in particular to introduce a graph-traversal algorithm that checks product-form relationships for all pairs of states, with time complexity $O(|V|^2 |E|)$, if the Markov chain has a finite transition graph $G = (V, E)$. We then generalize graph-based product form to encompass more complex relationships, which we call ``higher-level product-form'', and we again show these can be identified via a graph-traversal algorithm when the Markov chain has a finite state space. Lastly, we identify several examples from queueing theory that satisfy this product-form relationship.</description>

      <title>Entropy of spatial network with applications to non-extensive statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method is proposed for analyzing complexity and studying the information in random geometric networks using Tsallis entropy tool. Tsallis entropy of the ensemble of random geometric networks is calculated based on the components of the random connection model on the point process which is obtained by connecting the points with a probability that depends on their relative positions (10.1016/j.indag.2022.05.002, 2022). According to information theory and conditional discussion, the bounds for Shannon and Tsallis entropies of the ensemble of this random graph are presented. Using this function and Lagrange's formula, the connection function that provides the maximum Tsallis entropy based on general constraints is obtained. Then, a simulation-based example is presented to clarify the application of the proposed method in the study of ad hoc wireless networks. By observing the obtained results, it can be stated that the wireless networks that adhere to the model studied here are almost maximally complex. Also, Tsallis conditional entropy maximizing function is compared with other connection functions using numerical calculations and the optimal value for the maximization of conditional entropies is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of phaseless reconstruction from measurements with Poisson or Bernoulli distributed noise. This is of particular interest in biological imaging experiments where a low dose of radiation has to be used to mitigate potential damage of the specimen, resulting in low observed particle counts. We derive recovery guarantees for the spectral method for these noise models in the case of Gaussian measurements. Our results give a quantitative insight in the trade-off between the employed radiation dose per measurement and the overall sampling complexity.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage-free catastrophe reinsurance valuation for compound dynamic contagion claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider catastrophe stop-loss reinsurance valuation for a reinsurance company with dynamic contagion claims. To deal with conventional and emerging catastrophic events, we propose the use of a compound dynamic contagion process for the catastrophic component of the liability. Under the premise that there is an absence of arbitrage opportunity in the market, we obtain arbitrage-free premiums for these contacts. To this end, the Esscher transform is adopted to specify an equivalent martingale probability measure. We show that reinsurers have various ways of levying the security loading on the net premiums to quantify the catastrophic liability in light of the growing challenges posed by emerging risks arising from climate change, cyberattacks, and pandemics. We numerically compare arbitrage-free catastrophe stop-loss reinsurance premiums via the Monte Carlo simulation method. Sensitivity analyzes are performed by changing the Esscher parameters and the retention level.</description>

      <title>Mixing properties of a class of nonuniformly expanding maps. Application to H{\"o}lderian invariance principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing properties of a class of nonuniformly expanding maps when the return time to the basis has a weak moment of order p \&amp;gt;1, up to a slowly varying function. From these computations, we deduce an invariance principle in H{\"o}lder spaces for the partial sum process of Birkhoff sums of H{\"o}lder continuous observables. The results apply to a class of intermittent maps of the unit interval. For such a map, we also prove that the H{\"o}lder invariance principle remains true for BV observables.</description>

      <title>On noncentral Wishart mixtures of noncentral Wisharts and their use for testing random effects in factorial design models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a noncentral Wishart mixture of noncentral Wishart distributions with the same degrees of freedom yields a noncentral Wishart distribution, thereby extending the main result of Jones and Marchand [Stat 10 (2021), Paper No. e398, 7 pp.] from the chi-square to the Wishart setting. To illustrate its use, this fact is then employed to derive the finite-sample distribution of test statistics for random effects in a two-factor factorial design model with $d$-dimensional normal data, thereby broadening the findings of Bilodeau [ArXiv (2022), 6 pp.], who treated the case $d = 1$. The same approach makes it possible to test random effects in more general factorial design models.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Scale-Free Traffic Jams in Highway Networks: A Probabilistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion continues to escalate with urbanization and socioeconomic development, necessitating advanced modeling to understand and mitigate its impacts. In large-scale networks, traffic congestion can be studied using cascade models, where congestion not only impacts isolated segments, but also propagates through the network in a domino-like fashion. One metric for understanding these impacts is congestion cost, which is typically defined as the additional travel time caused by traffic jams. Recent data suggests that congestion cost exhibits a universal scale-free-tailed behavior. However, the mechanism driving this phenomenon is not yet well understood. To address this gap, we propose a stochastic cascade model of traffic congestion. We show that traffic congestion cost is driven by the scale-free distribution of traffic intensities. This arises from the catastrophe principle, implying that severe congestion is likely caused by disproportionately large traffic originating from a single location. We also show that the scale-free nature of congestion cost is robust to various congestion propagation rules, explaining the universal scaling observed in empirical data. These findings provide a new perspective in understanding the fundamental drivers of traffic congestion and offer a unifying framework for studying congestion phenomena across diverse traffic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.02438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(g_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $d\times d$ real random matrices. For $n\geq 1$ set $G_n = g_n \ldots g_1$. Given any starting point $x=\mathbb R v\in\mathbb{P}^{d-1}$, consider the Markov chain $X_n^x = \mathbb R G_n v $ on the projective space $\mathbb P^{d-1}$ and the norm cocycle $\sigma(G_n, x)= \log \frac{|G_n v|}{|v|}$, for an arbitrary norm $|\cdot|$ on $\mathbb R^{d}$. Under suitable conditions we prove a Berry-Esseen type theorem and an Edgeworth expansion for the couple $(X_n^x, \sigma(G_n, x))$. These results are established using a brand new smoothing inequality on complex plane, the saddle point method and additional spectral gap properties of the transfer operator related to the Markov chain $X_n^x$. Cram\'{e}r type moderate deviation expansions as well as a local limit theorem with moderate deviations are proved for the couple $(X_n^x, \sigma(G_n, x))$ with a target function $\varphi$ on the Markov chain $X_n^x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the matrix products $G_n: = g_n \ldots g_1$, where $(g_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed positive random $d\times d$ matrices. Under the optimal third moment condition, we first establish a Berry-Esseen theorem and an Edgeworth expansion for the $(i,j)$-th entry $G_n^{i,j}$ of the matrix $G_n$, where $1 \leq i, j \leq d$. Using the Edgeworth expansion for $G_n^{i,j}$ under the changed probability measure, we then prove precise upper and lower large deviation asymptotics for the entries $G_n^{i,j}$ subject to an exponential moment assumption. As applications, we deduce local limit theorems with large deviations for $G_n^{i,j}$ and upper and lower large deviations bounds for the spectral radius $\rho(G_n)$ of $G_n$. A byproduct of our approach is the local limit theorem for $G_n^{i,j}$ under the optimal second moment condition. In the proofs we develop a spectral gap theory for the norm cocycle and for the coefficients, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Moments and tails of Lq-valued chaoses based on independent variables with log-concave tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a lower bound for moments of random chaoses of order two with coefficients in arbitrary Banach space F generated by independent symmetric random variables with logarithmically concave tails (which is probably two-sided). We also provide two upper bounds for moments of such chaoses when F = L_q. The first is true under the additional subgaussanity assumption. The second one does not require additional assumptions but is not optimal in general. Both upper bounds are sufficient for obtaining two-sided moment estimates for chaoses with values in Lq generated by Weibull random variables with shape parameter greater or equal to 1.</description>

Abstract: Random Walks in Cooling Random Environments (RWCRE) is a model of random walks in dynamic random environments where the environment is frozen between a fixed sequence of times (called the cooling map) where it is resampled. Naturally the limiting distributions for this model depend both on the structure of the cooling sequence and on distribution $\mu$ from which the environments are sampled. Previous results have considered the cases where $\mu$ is such that the corresponding model of random walks in a fixed random environment (RWRE) is either (1) recurrent, (2) has a Gaussian limit with diffusive scaling (the $\kappa &gt; 2$ case), or (3) has positive speed and a stable, non-Gaussian limit (the $\kappa \in (1,2)$ case).
  In this paper we examine the limiting distributions in two other transient regimes: the sub-ballistic, non-stable regime (i.e., $\kappa \in (0,1)$), and the Gaussian regime with non-diffusive scaling (i.e., $\kappa = 2$). In the first case we show that the limiting distributions are either Gaussian or a mixture of Gaussian and independent sums of Mittag-Leffler random variables, while in the second case the limiting distributions are always Gaussian but with a scaling that differs from the standard deviation by factor (which can oscillate, but which remains confined to some interval $[\beta,1]$) that depends very delicately on the properties of the cooling map.</description>

      <title>The golf model on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a particle model, that we call the $\textit{golf model}$. Initially, on a graph $G$, balls and holes are placed at random on some distinct vertices. The balls then move one by one, doing a random walk on $G$, starting from their initial vertex and stopping at the first empty hole they encounter, which they fill. On finite graphs, under reasonable assumptions (if there are more holes than balls, and if the Markov chain characterizing the random walks is irreducible) a final configuration is reached almost surely. In the paper, we are mainly interested in ${\bf H}^1$, the set of remaining holes. We give the distribution of ${\bf H}^1$ on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and describe a phase transition for the largest distance between two consecutive holes when the number of remaining holes is of order $\sqrt{n}$. We show that the model on $\mathbb{Z}$ is well-defined if every vertex contains either a ball with probability $d_{\sf b}$, a hole with probability $d_{\sf h}$, or nothing, independently from the other vertices, as long as $d_{\sf b} \leq d_{\sf h}$, and we describe the law of ${\bf H}^1$ in this case.</description>

      <title>Sampling from the Continuous Random Energy Model in Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a toy model of spin glasses on $\{0,1\}^N$ that, in the limit, exhibits an infinitely hierarchical correlation structure. We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime $\beta&lt;\beta_{\min}:=\min\{\beta_c,\beta_G\}$, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g)^{O(1)}$, where $g$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold $\beta_{\min}$; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; while for $A$ non-concave, if $\beta_G&lt;\beta_c$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.</description>

Abstract: We show that the flip chain for non-crossing spanning trees of $n+1$ points in convex position mixes in time $O(n^8\log n)$. We use connections between Fuss-Catalan structures to construct a comparison argument with a chain similar to Wilson's lattice path chain (Wilson 2004).</description>

Abstract: We present generalizations and modifications of Eldan's Stochastic Localization process, extending it to incorporate non-Gaussian tilts, making it useful for a broader class of measures. As an application, we introduce new processes that enable the decomposition and analysis of non-quadratic potentials on the Boolean hypercube, with a specific focus on quartic polynomials. Using this framework, we derive new spectral gap estimates for tensor Ising models under Glauber dynamics, resulting in rapid mixing.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of quadratic RBSDEs and BSDEs with one-sided growth restrictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and comparison theorems for the bounded solutions and unbounded solutions of reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), whose generators have a one-sided growth restriction on $y$ and a general quadratic growth in $z$, and whose solutions $Y_t$ (and obstacles) take values in $(a,\infty)$ with $a\geq-\infty$. The existence of solutions was obtained mainly by using the methods from Essaky and Hassani (2011) and Bahlali et al. (2017), and some well-posedness results of ODEs. We provide a method for the uniqueness of solutions of such RBSDEs and BSDEs, whose generators satisfy a $\theta$-domination condition. This condition contains the generators which are convex in $(y,z)$ or are (locally) Lipschitz in $y$ and convex in $z$, and some generators which are not convex. Our method relies on the $\theta$-difference technique borrowed from Briand and Hu (2008), and some comparison arguments based on RBSDEs. We also provide a method to study the comparison theorems for such RBSDEs and BSDEs.</description>

      <title>Poincare Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-\L ojasiewicz Measures: Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of log-P{\L}$^\circ$ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably connected. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set $S$ to be a compact ${C}^2$ embedding submanifold of ${R}^d$ without boundary. The non-contractibility of $S$ distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on $S$, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an $\epsilon$-independent lower bound for the Poincar\'e constant in the Poincar\'e inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{O}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations under the weak H\"ormander condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the McKean-Vlasov equation $dX_t = b(t, X_t, [X_t])dt + \sigma(t, X_t, [X_t])dW_t$ where $[X_t]$ is the law of $X_t$. We focus specifically on the "kinetic" case, where the equation is degenerate in the sense that the dimension of the Brownian motion $W$ can be strictly less than the dimension of the solution $X$. Assuming H\"older continuous coefficients and a hypoellipticity condition, we prove the well-posedness of the equation. This result complements the existing literature by addressing the case where the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ depends on the law $[X_t]$, which have been previously unexplored. Our proof employs a novel technique that offers a simplified and direct argument, eliminating the need for PDEs involving derivatives with respect to the measure argument and exploiting the sub-Riemannian metric structure induced by the corresponding Fokker-Planck operator.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the probabilistic representation of the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by the generation of random trees. We present sufficient conditions on equation coefficients that ensure the integrability and uniform integrability of the functionals of random trees used in this representation, and yield quantitative estimates of its explosion time. Those conditions rely on the analysis of a marked branching process that controls the growth of random trees, in which marks can be interpreted as mutant types in population genetics models. We also show how branching process explosion is connected to existence and uniqueness of ODE solutions.</description>

Abstract: This paper derives a new numerical method for approximating Free Stochastic Differential Equations with strong convergence order one. Previously, the authors derived a free variant of the Euler-Maruyama method, which obeys strong convergence order of 0.5. In this paper these results are extended using multiple operator integrals and Taylor expansion of Operator Functions. The new method can be viewed as the free variant of the Milstein-Method for Stochastic Differential Equations. In addition, we generalize the results of the free Euler-Maruyama method to Lp({\phi}), 1 \leq p \leq \infty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these pedagogic notes I review the statistical mechanics approach to neural networks, focusing on the paradigmatic example of the perceptron architecture with binary an continuous weights, in the classification setting. I will review the Gardner's approach based on replica method and the derivation of the SAT/UNSAT transition in the storage setting. Then, I discuss some recent works that unveiled how the zero training error configurations are geometrically arranged, and how this arrangement changes as the size of the training set increases. I also illustrate how different regions of solution space can be explored analytically and how the landscape in the vicinity of a solution can be characterized. I give evidence how, in binary weight models, algorithmic hardness is a consequence of the disappearance of a clustered region of solutions that extends to very large distances. Finally, I demonstrate how the study of linear mode connectivity between solutions can give insights into the average shape of the solution manifold.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of general semilinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neufeld and Wu (arXiv:2310.12545) developed a multilevel Picard (MLP) algorithm which can approximately solve general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities, allowing also for coefficient functions of the corresponding PDE to be non-constant. By introducing a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula and identifying the first and second component of the unique fixed-point of the SFPE with the unique viscosity solution of the PDE and its gradient, they proved convergence of their algorithm. However, it remained an open question whether the proposed MLP schema in arXiv:2310.12545 does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we prove that the MLP algorithm in arXiv:2310.12545 indeed can overcome the curse of dimensionality, i.e. that its computational complexity only grows polynomially in the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the accuracy $\varepsilon$, under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear part of the corresponding PDE.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Age of Information with Multiple Coexisting Data Streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the distribution of the Age of Information (AoI) of a tagged data stream sharing a processor with a set of other data streams. We do so in the highly general setting in which the interarrival times pertaining to the tagged stream can have any distribution, and also the service times of both the tagged stream and the background stream are generally distributed. The packet arrival times of the background process are assumed to constitute a Poisson process, which is justified by the fact that it typically is a superposition of many relatively homogeneous streams. The first main contribution is that we derive an expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the AoI in the resulting GI+M/GI+GI/1 model. Second, we use stochastic ordering techniques to identify tight stochastic bounds on the AoI, leading to an explicit lower and upper bound on the mean AoI. In addition, when approximating the tagged stream's inter-generation times through a phase-type distribution (which can be done at any precision), we present a computational algorithm for the mean AoI. As illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments, the analysis enables us to assess the impact of background traffic on the AoI of the tagged stream. It turns out that the upper bound on the mean AoI is remarkably close to its true value, which yields an explicit expression (in terms of the model parameters) for an accurate proxy of the AoI-minimizing generation rate.</description>

Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <title>Selective Reviews of Bandit Problems in AI via a Statistical View</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Additionally, we explore K-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, focusing on their methodologies and regret analyses. We also examine the connections between SCAB problems and functional data analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we proved that the reverse Riesz transform on the graphical Sierpinski gasket is unbounded on $L^p$ for $p\in (1,2)$. Together with previous results, it shows that the Riesz transform on the graphical Sierpinski gasket is bounded on $L^p$ if and only if $p\in (1,2]$ and the reverse Riesz transform is bounded on $L^p$ if and only if $p\in [2,\infty)$.
  Moreover, our method is quite flexible - but requires explicit computations - and hints to the fact that the reverse Riesz transforms is never bounded on $L^p$, $p\in (1,2)$, on graphs with slow diffusions.</description>

      <title>When defaults cannot be hedged: an actuarial approach to xVA calculations via local risk-minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the pricing and hedging of counterparty credit risk and funding when there is no possibility to hedge the jump to default of either the bank or the counterparty. This represents the situation which is most often encountered in practice, due to the absence of quoted corporate bonds or CDS contracts written on the counterparty and the difficulty for the bank to buy/sell protection on her own default. We apply local risk-minimization to find the optimal strategy and compute it via a BSDE.</description>
