      <title>Emergence of biconnected clusters in explosive percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing a simple competition mechanism for the insertion of bonds in random graphs, the explosive percolation demonstrates a sharped phase transition with rich critical phenomena. In this paper, we study the high-order connectivity in the explosive percolation by the event-based ensemble, focusing on the biconnected cluster, in which any two sites are connected by at least two independent paths. Although the biconnected clusters are formed only by inserting intra-cluster bonds, we numerically confirm that the percolation threshold of the biconnected cluster is independent of a special competition mechanism for the intra-cluster bond, instead, it shares the same value with the percolation of simply connected clusters. Moreover, it is very interesting that the volume fractal dimension of the biconnected clusters $d_{f}'$ varies when different competition mechanisms are applied to intra-cluster bonds. The fit results suggest that $d_{f}'$ is much smaller than the volume fractal dimension of the connected cluster $d_{f}$, indicating a non-explosive transition of the biconnected cluster. The size distribution of biconnected clusters shows a double-scaling behavior -- the size distribution of large clusters is still governed by the standard Fisher exponent derived from the hyperscaling relation $\tau'=1+1/d_{f}'$, while a modified Fisher exponent $\tau_0\leq1$ is found for small clusters. The value of $\tau_0$, and the crossover of the two scalings depends on the competition mechanism of intra-cluster bonds. All these demonstrate that the high-order connectivity also shows some unusual features by simply suppressing the growth of clusters in the percolation model.</description>

      <title>Phase Behavior and Dynamics of Active Brownian Particles in an Alignment Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles that are subject to noise are a well-established generic model system for active matter. A homogeneous alignment field can be used to orient the direction of the self-propulsion velocity and to model systems like phoretic Janus particles with a magnetic dipole moment or magnetotactic bacteria in an external magnetic field. Computer simulations are used to predict the phase behavior and dynamics of self-propelled Brownian particles in a homogeneous alignment field in two dimensions. Phase boundaries of the gas-liquid coexistence region are calculated for various P\'eclet numbers, particle densities, and alignment field strengths. Critical points and exponents are calculated and, in agreement with previous simulations, do not seem to belong to the universality class of the 2D Ising model. Finally, the dynamics of spinodal decomposition for quenching the system from the one-phase to the two-phase coexistence region by increasing P\'eclet number is characterized. Our results may help to identify parameters for optimal transport of active matter in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Role of long jumps in L\'evy noise induced multimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L\'evy noise is a paradigmatic noise used to describe out-of-equilibrium systems. Typically, properties of L\'evy noise driven systems are very different from their Gaussian white noise driven counterparts. In particular, under action of L\'evy noise, stationary states in single-well, super-harmonic, potentials are no longer unimodal. Typically, they are bimodal however for fine-tuned potentials the number of modes can be further increased. The multimodality arises as a consequence of the competition between long displacements induced by the non-equilibrium stochastic driving and action of the deterministic force. Here, we explore robustness of bimodality in the quartic potential under action of the L\'evy noise. We explore various scenarios of bounding long jumps and assess their ability to weaken and disassembly multimodality. In general, we demonstrate that despite its robustness it is possible to destroy the bimodality by limiting the length of noise-induced jumps.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-concept for a nonadditive stochastic model of supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed non-additive stochastic model (NSM) offers a coherent physical interpretation for diffusive phenomena in glass-forming systems. This model presents non-exponential relationships between viscosity, activation energy, and temperature, characterizing the non-Arrhenius behavior observed in supercooled liquids. In this work, we fit the NSM viscosity equation to experimental temperature-dependent viscosity data corresponding to twenty-five glass-forming liquids and compare the fit parameters with those obtained using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT), Avramov-Milchev (AM), and Mauro-Yue-Ellison-Gupta-Allan (MYEGA) models. The results demonstrate that the NSM provides an effective fitting equation for modeling viscosity experimental data in comparison with other established models (VFT, AM and MYEGA), characterizing the activation energy in fragile liquids, presenting a reliable indicator of the degree of fragility of the glass-forming liquids.</description>

      <title>Novel approach of exploring ASEP-like models through the Yang Baxter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the algebraic structure of a particular ansatz of Yang Baxter Equation which is inspired from the Bethe Ansatz treatment of the ASEP spin-model. Various classes of Hamiltonian density arriving from two types of R-Matrices are found which also appear as solutions of constant YBE. We identify the idempotent and nilpotent categories of such constant R-Matrices and perform a rank-1 numerical search for the lowest dimension. A summary of finalised results reveals general non-hermitian spin-1/2 chain models.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory of Interactions -- I. The General Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding realistic complex systems requires confronting significant conceptual, theoretical and experimental limitations rooted in the persistence of views that originated in the mechanics of simple moving bodies. We define the category of complex multiscale stochastic systems as a useful device for capturing the minimally required complexity of many types of phenomena. In doing so, we provide evidence indicating that determinism, continuity and reversibility can lead to theoretical inadequacies that manifest as intractability, inaccuracies or non-representativeness when applied to complex systems. We take the view that interactions are fundamental and summarize their portrayal across many disciplines. Despite their centrality, interactions remain largely neglected as subjects of research interest of their own. We hypothesize that a generalized theory of interactions may help organize evidence from multiple scientific domains towards a more unified realistic view of systems.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Theory of Interactions -- II. The Theoretical Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After discussing the significance of interactions to understand complex multiscale stochastic systems (CMSS), we turn our attention to the construction of a Generalised Theory of Interactions (GToI). We define interactions as discrete, localised events where the thermodynamically irreversible exchange of degrees of freedom involves signal propagation and relaxation phenomena. We proceed to define the mechanics of such space, as well as how these approximately map onto dynamical manifolds. By characterising various systems through the effect of transformations across interaction space, we develop a view of systems where features such as emergence and information representation become apparent. Our theory appears to capture structural and dynamical features of CMSS efficiently by making explicit the extent of the dynamical range of action in them; we identify the boundaries of such range with statistical limits corresponding to physical laws, and derive a generalised form of the Correspondence Principle.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial quantum criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method to show how fixed-point annihilations within symmetry-enhanced parameter manifolds affect the anisotropy-driven criticality across them. We find a tunable transition between two long-range-ordered localized phases that can be continuous or strongly first-order, and even becomes weakly first-order in an extended regime close to the fixed-point collision. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. In particular, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. In addition, we also study the crossover behavior away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase for $\alpha_z &lt; \alpha_{xy}$.</description>

      <title>From Zero to Hero: How local curvature at artless initial conditions leads away from bad minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization dynamics of gradient descent in a non-convex and high-dimensional setting, with a focus on the phase retrieval problem as a case study for complex loss landscapes. We first study the high-dimensional limit where both the number $M$ and the dimension $N$ of the data are going to infinity at fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = M/N$. By analyzing how the local curvature changes during optimization, we uncover that for intermediate $\alpha$, the Hessian displays a downward direction pointing towards good minima in the first regime of the descent, before being trapped in bad minima at the end. Hence, the local landscape is benign and informative at first, before gradient descent brings the system into a uninformative maze. The transition between the two regimes is associated to a BBP-type threshold in the time-dependent Hessian. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we show that in practical cases, i.e. for finite but even very large $N$, successful optimization via gradient descent in phase retrieval is achieved by falling towards the good minima before reaching the bad ones. This mechanism explains why successful recovery is obtained well before the algorithmic transition corresponding to the high-dimensional limit. Technically, this is associated to strong logarithmic corrections of the algorithmic transition at large $N$ with respect to the one expected in the $N\to\infty$ limit. Our analysis sheds light on such a new mechanism that facilitate gradient descent dynamics in finite large dimensions, also highlighting the importance of good initialization of spectral properties for optimization in complex high-dimensional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Arctic curves of the T-system with Slanted Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

      <title>Opinion inertia and coarsening in the Persistent Voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Persistent Voter model (PVM), a variant of the Voter model (VM) that includes transient, dynamically-induced zealots. Due to peer reinforcement, the internal confidence $\eta_i$ of a normal voter increases by steps of size $\Delta\eta$ and once it gets above a given threshold, it becomes a zealot. Then, its opinion remains frozen until enough interactions with the opposite opinion occur and its confidence is reset. No longer a zealot, the regular voter may change opinion once again. This opinion inertia mechanism, albeit simplified, is responsible for an effective surface tension and the PVM has a crossover from a fluctuation-driven dynamics, as in the VM, to a curvature-driven one, as in the Ising Model at low temperature (IM0). The average time $\tau$ to attain consensus is non-monotonic on $\Delta\eta$ and has a minimum at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. In this paper we clarify the mechanisms that accelerate the system towards consensus close to $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. Close to the crossover at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$, the intermediate region around the domains where the regular voters accumulate (the active region, AR) is large and the surface tension, albeit small, is still enough to keep the shape and reduce the fragmentation of the domains. The large size of the AR in the region of $\Delta\eta_{\min}$ has two important effects that accelerates the dynamics. First, it dislodges the zealots in the bulk of the domains and second, it maximally suppresses the slowly-evolving stripes that normally form in Ising-like models. This suggests the importance of understanding the role of the AR, where the change of opinion is facilitated, and the interplay between regular voters and zealots when attempting to disrupt polarized states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the absorbing state transition in particulate systems under spatially inhomogeneous driving using a modified random organization model. For smoothly varying driving the steady state results map onto the homogeneous absorbing state phase diagram, with the position of the boundary between absorbing and diffusive states being insensitive to the driving wavelength. Here the phenomenology is well-described by a one-dimensional continuum model that we pose. For discontinuously varying driving the position of the absorbing phase boundary and the exponent characterising the fraction of active particles are altered relative to the homogeneous case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from static to dynamic friction when an elastic body is slid over another is now known to result from the motion of interface rupture fronts. These fronts may be either crack-like or pulse-like, with the latter involving reattachment in the wake of the front. How and why these fronts occur remains a subject of active theoretical and experimental investigation, given its wide ranging implications for a range of problems in tribology. In this work, we investigate this question using an elastic lattice-network representation; bulk and interface bonds are simulated to deform and, in the latter case, break and reform dynamically in response to an applied remote displacement. We find that, contrary to the oft-cited rigid body scenario with Coulomb-type friction laws, the type of rupture front observed depends intimately on the location of the applied boundary condition. Depending on whether the sliding solid is pulled, pushed or sheared -- all equivalent applications in the rigid case -- distinct interface rupture modes can occur. We quantify these rupture modes, evaluate the interface stresses that lead to their formation, and and study their subsequent propagation dynamics. A strong analogy between the sliding friction problem and mode II fracture emerges from our results, with attendant wave speeds ranging from slow to Rayleigh. We discuss how these fronts mediate interface motion and implications for the general transition mechanism from static to dynamic friction.</description>

      <title>Predictive power of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory based on Renormalization Group throughout the BCS-BEC crossover in 2D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on 2D superconductors allow the characterization of the critical temperature and of the phase diagram across the BCS-BEC crossover as a function of density. We obtain from these experiments the microscopic parameters of the superconducting state at low temperatures by the BCS mean-field approach. For Li$_x$ZrNCl, the extracted parameters are used to evaluate the superconducting phase stiffness and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical temperature throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, by implementing the corresponding Renormalization Group (RG) approach. In this way, we make a quantitative test of the predictive power of the BKT theory for evaluating the critical temperature. The RG flow equations turn out to give a sizable renormalization of the phase stiffness and of the critical temperature, which is crucial to obtain a satisfactory agreement between the BKT theory and the experiments, in particular in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. We predict the temperature range where phase stiffness renormalization can be measured in Li$_x$ZrNCl across the BCS-BEC crossover. Contrary to other microscopic theories of superconductivity, we find that the BKT theory can be exploited to evaluate quantitatively the critical temperature of 2D superconductors in different pairing regimes.</description>

      <title>Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological insulators have expanded into the nonlinear regime, while the bulk-edge correspondence in strongly nonlinear systems has been unelucidated. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit a transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of equilibrium phase transition in confined fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase transition of confined fluids in mesoporous materials deviates from that of bulk fluids due to the former's interactions with the surrounding heterogeneous structure. For example, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) create a strong heterogeneous field, so adsorbed fluids in MOFs have atypical phase characteristics such as capillary condensation and higher-order phase transitions. These characteristics are modeled by decoupling the host-guest and guest-guest interactions as a many-body problem in the presence of an external nonuniform field. To solve the three-dimensional Ising model, we use mean-field theory to approximate the guest-guest interactions and Mayer's (f)-functions to describe the host-guest interactions in a unit cell. Later, using Hill's theory of nanothermodynamics, we define differential and integral thermodynamic functions to describe confined fluids. These integral properties are then used to understand the phase transition in confined fluids. The investigation reveals a distinct behavior where fluids confined in larger pores undergo a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition, whereas those confined in smaller pores undergo a continuous (higher-order) phase transition. Furthermore, the results indicate that the free-energy barrier for phase transitions is lower in confined fluids than in bulk fluids, which helps explain the lower condensation pressure relative to the bulk saturation pressure. Finally, the integral thermodynamic functions are succinctly presented in the form of a phase diagram, marking an initial step toward a more practical approach for understanding the phase behavior of confined fluids.</description>

Abstract: In many physical or biological systems, diffusion can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate properties of the diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs with a novel approach. We show that for a finite time, the propagator is non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed. This means that when the mean square displacements are the same, for a finite time, some of the diffusing particles with stochastic DCs diffuse farther than the particles with deterministic DCs or exhibiting a fractional Brownian motion. We also show that when a stochastic DC is ergodic, the propagator converges to a Gaussian distribution in the long time limit. The speed of convergence is determined by the autocovariance function of the DC.</description>

      <title>Integrability is attractive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum chaos and integrability has been extensively studied in the past decades. We approach this topic from the point of view of geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other, integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those parallel to integrability, and the anisotropy between them diverges in the thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. We also provide evidence that the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is universal for both models, similar to continuous phase transitions, and that the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids ergodicity.</description>

      <title>An estimator of entropy production for partially accessible Markov networks based on the observation of blurred transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central task in stochastic thermodynamics is the estimation of entropy production for partially accessible Markov networks. We establish an effective transition-based description for such networks with transitions that are not distinguishable and therefore blurred for an external observer. We demonstrate that, in contrast to a description based on fully resolved transitions, this effective description is typically non-Markovian at any point in time. Starting from an information-theoretic bound, we derive an operationally accessible entropy estimator for this observation scenario. We illustrate the operational relevance and the quality of this entropy estimator with a numerical analysis of various representative examples.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic gauge potential and integrability breaking with free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of integrability breaking in free fermionic quantum spin chains. We investigate the so-called adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), which was recently proposed as an accurate probe of quantum chaos. We also study the so-called weak integrability breaking, which occurs if the dynamical effects of the perturbation do not appear at leading order in the perturbing parameter. A recent statement in the literature claimed that integrability breaking should generally lead to an exponential growth of the AGP norm with respect to the volume. However, afterwards it was found that weak integrability breaking is a counter-example, leading to a cross-over between polynomial and exponential growth. Here we show that in free fermionic systems the AGP norm always grows polynomially, if the perturbation is local with respect to the fermions, even if the perturbation strongly breaks integrability. As a by-product of our computations we also find, that in free fermionic spin chains there are operators which weakly break integrability, but which are not associated with known long range deformations.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity in Krylov Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity provide fast protocols for quantum state preparation in which the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic controls circumvents the requirement of slow driving in adiabatic strategies. While their development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term, equivalently the adiabatic gauge potential, is solved by introducing a Krylov basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single- and many-particle models. The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by an algorithmic method. We examine how the expansion in the Krylov basis incorporates many-body interactions in the counterdiabatic term.</description>

      <title>Finite-size subthermal regime in disordered SU(N)-symmetric Heisenberg chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SU(N) symmetry is incompatible with the many-body localized (MBL) phase, even when strong disorder is present. However, recent studies have shown that finite-size SU(2) systems exhibit non-ergodic, subthermal behavior, characterized by the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and by the excited eigenstates entanglement entropy that is intermediate between area and volume law. In this work, we extend previous studies of the SU(2)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model to larger systems, using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) method. We simulate quench dynamics from weakly entangled initial states up to long times, finding robust subthermal behavior at stronger disorder. Although we find an increased tendency towards thermalization at larger system sizes, the subthermal regime persists at intermediate time scales, nevertheless, and therefore should be accessible experimentally. At weaker disorder, we observe signatures of thermalization, however, entanglement entropy exhibits slow sublinear growth, in contrast to conventional thermalizing systems. Furthermore, we study dynamics of the SU(3)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model. Similarly, strong disorder drives the system into subthermal regime, albeit thermalizing phase is broader compared to the SU(2) case. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the subthermal regime in spin chains with non-Abelian continuous symmetry, and are consistent with eventual thermalization at large system sizes and long time scales, suggested by previous works.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method to realize tunable quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our scheme uses a two-photon Raman transition and transformation to the spin-rotating frame. We investigate the properties of the model including only the DMI and Zeeman energy, which can be experimentally realized in our scheme. We show that the model accommodates exact and asymptotic quantum many-body scars exhibiting nonergodic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How much information a fermionic state contains? To address this fundamental question, we define the complexity of a particle-conserving many-fermion state as the entropy of its Fock space probability distribution, minimized over all Fock representations. The complexity characterizes the minimum computational and physical resources required to represent the state and store the information obtained from it by measurements. Alternatively, the complexity can be regarded a Fock space entanglement measure describing the intrinsic many-particle entanglement in the state. We establish universal lower bound for the complexity in terms of the single-particle correlation matrix eigenvalues and formulate a finite-size complexity scaling hypothesis. Remarkably, numerical studies on interacting lattice models suggest a general model-independent complexity hierarchy: ground states are exponentially less complex than average excited states which, in turn, are exponentially less complex than generic states in the Fock space. Our work has fundamental implications on how much information is encoded in fermionic states.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in the toric code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how distinct phases of matter can be generated by performing random single-qubit measurements on a subsystem of toric code. Using a parton construction, such measurements map to random Gaussian tensor networks, and in particular, random Pauli measurements map to a classical loop model in which watermelon correlators precisely determine measurement-induced entanglement. Measuring all but a 1d boundary of qubits realizes hybrid circuits involving unitary gates and projective measurements in 1+1 dimensions. We find that varying the probabilities of different Pauli measurements can drive transitions in the un-measured boundary between phases with different orders and entanglement scaling, corresponding to short and long loop phases in the classical model. Furthermore, by utilizing single-site boundary unitaries conditioned on the bulk measurement outcomes, we generate mixed state ordered phases and transitions that can be experimentally diagnosed via linear observables. This demonstrates how parton constructions provide a natural framework for measurement-based quantum computing setups to produce and manipulate phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled micron-size particles suspended in a fluid, like bacteria or synthetic microswimmers, are strongly non-equilibrium systems where particle motility breaks the microscopic detailed balance, often resulting in large-scale collective motion. Previous theoretical work has identified long-range hydrodynamic interactions as the main driver of collective motion in unbounded dilute suspension of rear-actuated ("pusher") microswimmers. In contrast, most experimental studies of collective motion in microswimmer suspensions have been carried out in quasi-2-dimensional geometries such as in thin films or near solid or fluid interfaces, where both the swimmers' motion and their long-range flow fields become altered due to the proximity of a boundary. Here, we study numerically a minimal model of microswimmers in such a restricted geometry, where the particles move in the midplane between two no-slip walls. For pushers, we demonstrate collective motion with only short-ranged order, in contrast with the long-ranged flows observed in unbounded systems. For front-actuated ("puller") microswimmers, we discover a long-wavelength density instability resulting in the formation of dense microswimmer clusters. Both types of collective motion are fundamentally different from their previously studied counterparts in unbounded domains. Our results illustrate that hydrodynamic screening due to the presence of a wall is subdominant in determining the collective state of the suspension, which is instead dictated by the geometrical restriction of the swimmers' motion.</description>

      <title>Configurational and Vibrational Entropy in Hydrogen-bonded Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of liquids and supercritical fluids is notorious for eluding a general theory, as can be done for crystalline solids on the basis of phonons and crystal symmetry. The extension of solid state notions such as configurational entropy and phonons to the liquid state remains an intriguing but challenging topic. This is particularly true for liquids like water whose many structural anomalies give it unique properties. Here, for simple fluids, we specify the thermodynamics across the liquid, supercritical, and gaseous states using the spectrum of propagating phonons, thereby determining the non-ideal entropy of the fluid using a single parameter arising from this phonon spectrum. This identifies a marked distinction between these "simple" fluids, and hydrogen bonded fluids whose non-ideal entropy cannot be determined by the phonon spectrum alone. We relate this phonon theory of thermodynamics to the previously observed excess entropy scaling in liquids and how the phonon spectrum creates corresponding states across the fluid phase diagram. These results provide important theoretical understanding to supercritical fluid, whose properties are still poorly understood despite widespread deployment in environmental and energy applications.</description>

Abstract: We consider an open interacting particle system on a finite lattice. The particles perform asymmetric simple exclusion and are randomly created or destroyed at all sites, with rates that grow rapidly near the boundaries. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density at the hyperbolic space-time scale and obtain the entropy solution to a boundary-driven quasilinear conservation law with a relaxation term. Different from the usual boundary conditions introduced in [Bardos, Roux, and Nedelec, (1979), Comm. Part. Diff. Equ], discontinuity (boundary layer) does not formulate at the boundaries due to the strong relaxation scheme.</description>
