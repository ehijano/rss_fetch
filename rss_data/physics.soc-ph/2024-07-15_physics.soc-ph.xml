      <title>Social dilemmas, network reciprocity and the small-world property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit two evolutionary game theory models, namely the Prisoner and the Snowdrift dilemmas, on top of small-world networks. These dynamics on networked populations (individuals occupying nodes of a graph) are mainly concerning on the competition between to cooperate or to defect, by allowing some process of revision of strategies. Cooperators avoid defectors by forming clusters in a process known as network reciprocity. This defense strategy is based on the fact that any individual interact only with its nearest neighbors. The minimum cluster, in turn, is formed by a set of three completely connected nodes and the bulk of these triplets is associated with the transitivity property of a network. Particularly, we show that the transitivity increases eventually assuming a constant behavior when observed as a function of the number of contacts of an individual. We investigate the influence of the network reciprocity on that transitivity increasing regime on the promotion of a cooperative behavior. The dynamics on small-world networks are compared with those random regular, and annealed networks, the later typically studied as the well-mixed approach. We observe that the Snowdrift Game converge to an annealed scenario as randonness and coordination number increase, whereas the Prisoner's Dilemma becomes more severe against the cooperative behavior under the regime of an increasing network reciprocity.</description>

      <title>How buildings change the fundamental allometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the original fundamental allometry alone cannot accurately describe the relationship between urban area and population size. Instead, building height is a third factor that interplays with area and population. To illustrate this, we propose a straightforward model based on the idea that city area is the result of people's desire to live close to one another while also having sufficient living space. This leads to a more general form of fundamental allometry (relating area, population, and building height). Our argument is supported by empirical data from different countries.</description>

      <title>Team careers in science: formation, composition and success of persistent collaborations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teams are the fundamental units propelling innovation and advancing modern science. A rich literature links the fundamental features of teams, such as their size and diversity, to academic success. However, such analyses fail to capture temporal patterns, treating each group of co-authors as a distinct unit and neglecting the existence of persistent collaborations. By contrast, teams are dynamical entities, made of core members who consistently work together, surrounded by transient members who sporadically participate. Leveraging on a large dataset of over 205 million scientific papers published since 1900, we extract 511,550 core teams of statistically significant persistent collaborations of pairs and larger groups of scientists. We look into `team careers' investigating their trajectories in time, characterizing their formation, productivity and eventual dissolution. We characterize team composition along multiple dimensions, including age, academic affiliation and scientific disciplines. Finally, we investigate the academic impact of persistent collaborations, hallmarking the key compositional features underlying their success. Our work sheds light on the nature of persistent teams, informing researchers, institutions and funding agencies about the dynamics of their formation, evolution and success.</description>

      <title>Is Contrasting All You Need? Contrastive Learning for the Detection and Attribution of AI-generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant progress in the development of Large Language Models has contributed to blurring the distinction between human and AI-generated text. The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.</description>

      <title>CAACS: A Carbon Aware Ant Colony System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly crucial, we introduce a new Carbon-Aware Ant Colony System (CAACS) Algorithm that addresses the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) while minimizing carbon emissions. This novel approach leverages the natural efficiency of ant colony pheromone trails to find optimal routes, balancing both environmental and economic objectives. By integrating sustainability into transportation models, CAACS provides a powerful tool for real-world applications, including network design, delivery route planning, and commercial aircraft logistics. Our algorithm's unique bi-objective optimization advances the study of sustainable transportation solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal bias of utility function between two-layer network for the evolution of prosocial behavior in two-order game and higher-order game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation is an important research object in economics, sociology, and biology, and the evolution of cooperation in structured populations is a interesting research topic. We mainly focus on the evolution of cooperation with two-order and higher-order game in two-layer network. We introduce a bias coefficient of utility function and study the influence of bias coefficient on the evolution of cooperation in two-layer network. We firstly provide theoretical analysis of fixation probabilities of two-order and higher-order game under weak selection in two-layer network.Secondly,based on the expression of fixation probability, we obtain the critical value of the two different games by comparing the size relationship of fixation probability under weak selection condition and neutral selection condition. Finally, by comparing the relationship between the critical value of single-layer and two-layer network in two-order game and higher-order game, when the nonlinear factor satisfies certain conditions, it is concluded that when the optimal bias coefficient tends towards 0 is met, some two-layer networks promote the evolution of cooperative behavior more than some single-layer networks.</description>

      <title>Human-machine social systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From fake social media accounts and generative-AI chatbots to financial trading algorithms and self-driving vehicles, robots, bots, and algorithms are proliferating and permeating our communication channels, social interactions, economic transactions, and transportation arteries. Networks of multiple interdependent and interacting humans and autonomous machines constitute complex social systems where the collective outcomes cannot be deduced from either human or machine behavior alone. Under this paradigm, we review recent research from across a range of disciplines and identify general dynamics and patterns in situations of competition, coordination, cooperation, contagion, and collective decision-making, with context-rich examples from high-frequency trading markets, a social media platform, an open-collaboration community, and a discussion forum. To ensure more robust and resilient human-machine communities, researchers should study them using complex-system methods, engineers should explicitly design AI for human-machine and machine-machine interactions, and regulators should govern the ecological diversity and social co-evolution of humans and machines.</description>
