Abstract: Ultrasound follicle tracking is an important part of cycle monitoring. OSIS Ovary (Online System for Image Segmentation for the Ovary) has been conceived aiming to aid the management of the workflow in follicle tracking, one of the most iterative procedures in cycle monitoring during ovarian stimulation. In the present study, we compared OSIS Ovary (as three-dimensional ultrasound-based automated system) with the two-dimensional manual standard measurement method, in order to assess the reliability of the main measurements obtained to track follicle growth during ovarian stimulation cycles, the follicle size and count. Based on the mean follicle diameter and follicle count values obtained, the Pearson/intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.976/0.987 and 0.804/0.889 in &gt;=10mm follicles, 0.989/0.994 and 0.809/0.867 in &gt;=13mm follicles and 0.995/0.997 and 0.791/0.840 in &gt;=16mm follicles. The mean difference (MnD) for the mean diameter and follicle count was, respectively, 0.759/0.161 in &gt;=10mm follicles, 0.486/1.033 in &gt;=13mm follicles and 0.784/0.486 in &gt;=16mm follicles. The upper and lower limits of agreement (ULA and LLA) were 3.641/2.123 and 5.392/3.070 in &gt;=10mm follicles, 3.496/2.522 and 4.285/2.218 in &gt;=13mm follicles, and 3.723/2.153 and 2.432/1.459 in &gt;=16mm follicles. The limits of agreement range (LoAR) were 5.764/8.462 in &gt;=10mm follicles, 6.048/6.503 in &gt;=13mm follicles and 5.876/3.891 in &gt;=16mm follicles. P&lt;0.05 was considered for all calculations. As three-dimensional ultrasound-based automated system in comparison with two-dimensional manual method standard, we found OSIS Ovary as a reliable tool to track follicle growth during ovarian stimulation cycles</description>
