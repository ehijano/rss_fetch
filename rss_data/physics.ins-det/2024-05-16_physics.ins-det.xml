      <title>An indirect geometry crystal time-of-flight spectrometer for FRM II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concept for an indirect geometry crystal time-of-flight spectrometer, which we propose for the FRM-II reactor in Garching. Recently, crystal analyzer spectrometers at modern spallation sources have been proposed and are under construction. The secondary spectrometers of these instruments are evolutions of the flat cone multi-analyzer for three-axis spectrometers (TAS). The instruments will provide exceptional reciprocal space coverage and intensity to map out the excitation landscape in novel materials. We will discuss the benefits of such a time-of-flight primary spectrometer with a large crystal analyzer spectrometer at a continuous neutron source. The dynamical range can be very flexibly matched to the requirements of the experiment without sacrificing the neutron intensity. At the same time, the chopper system allows a quasi-continuous variation of the initial energy resolution. The neutron optics of the proposed instrument employs the novel nested mirror optics, which images neutrons from a bright virtual source onto the sample. The spot size of less than 1 cm x 1 cm at the virtual source allows the realization of very short neutron pulses by the choppers, while the small and well-defined spot size at the sample position provides an excellent energy resolution of the secondary spectrometer thanks to the prismatic focusing of the analyzer.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to light-sheet microscopy for nanoscale imaging: Looking beyond the cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive guide to light-sheet microscopy (LSM) to assist scientists in navigating the practical implementation of this microscopy technique. Emphasizing the applicability of LSM to image both static microscale and nanoscale features, as well as diffusion dynamics, we present the fundamental concepts of microscopy, progressing through beam profile considerations, to image reconstruction. We outline key practical decisions in constructing a home-built system and provide insight into the alignment and calibration processes. We briefly discuss the conditions necessary for constructing a continuous 3D image and introduce our home-built code for data analysis. By providing this guide, we aim to alleviate the challenges associated with designing and constructing LSM systems and offer scientists new to LSM a valuable resource in navigating this complex field.</description>

      <title>Design and commissioning of a high-level control system for a medical isochronous cyclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MEDICYC (MEDical CYClotron) is an isochronous cyclotron dedicated to radiotherapy which was built and commissioned in Nice, France, in 1990 by a local team aided by experts from CERN. The cyclotron accelerates negative H to a maximum energy of 65 MeV and uses stripping to extract a proton beam. Its primary purpose is treating ocular melanoma by protontherapy but a significant research activity is also present on beam-lines dedicated for this purpose. An extensive refurbishment program of the cyclotron has been started to cope with the end-of-life and/or the obsolescence of several sub-systems. In this context, a new high-level cyclotron control system has been developed and commissioned in 2021-2024. The primary responsibility of the system is the high-level coordination of the source, the RF system, the beam-line and cyclotron magnets, to produce and deliver a beam with a given set of characteristics. A secondary responsibility is the collection, visualization and analysis of sub-system and beam data for monitoring and pre-emptive fault detection. In this contribution, the control system software architecture is presented and the infrastructure on which the systems are deployed is laid out.</description>

      <title>Low Radon Concentration Measurement with a Radon-Dissolved Liquid Scintillator Pilot Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a high sensitivity radon pilot detector using liquid scintillator dissolved radon for the CDEX rare-event searches program. The CDEX-10 project employs a germanium detector array immersed in a massive liquid nitrogen tank. However, radon emanated from the surface of the tank can contribute background. As a result, radon contamination in the liquid nitrogen tank must be regulated and monitored, which necessitates the use of a low-level Rn measuring device. The radon-dissolved liquid scintillator (LS) detectors utilizes cascade decay selections, yielding a unique signature. All background events occurring in the LS, with regard to the system and co-efficiency of Rn absorption, have been studied. Background activity is measured to be 59.8$\pm$18.4 $\mu$Bq per 300 mL LS. Meanwhile, it shows that radon concentration absorbed by LS will be saturated and is linearly related to radon concentration in nitrogen gas. Furthermore, the co-efficiency factor can be optimized by lowering temperature or raising pressure. Eventually the detection limit for 222^Rn in nitrogen gas is observed to be 9.6 mBq/m^3.</description>

      <title>PANCAKE: a large-diameter cryogenic test platform with a flat floor for next generation multi-tonne liquid xenon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PANCAKE facility is the world's largest liquid xenon test platform. Inside its cryostat with an internal diameter of 2.75 m, components for the next generation of liquid xenon experiments, such as DARWIN or XLZD, will be tested at their full scale. This is essential to ensure their successful operation. This work describes the facility, including its cryostat, cooling systems, xenon handling infrastructure, and its monitoring and instrumentation. The inner vessel has a flat floor, which allows the full diameter to be used with a modest amount of xenon. This is a novel approach for such a large cryostat and is of interest for future large-scale experiments, where a standard torispherical head would require tonnes of additional xenon. Our current xenon inventory of 400 kg allows a liquid depth of about 2 cm in the inner cryostat vessel. We also describe the commissioning of the facility, which is now ready for component testing.</description>

      <title>Search for Axion dark matter with the QUAX-LNF tunable haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first experimental results obtained with the new haloscope of the QUAX experiment located at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of INFN (LNF). The haloscope is composed of a OFHC Cu resonant cavity cooled down to about 30 mK and immersed in a magnetic field of 8 T. The cavity frequency was varied in a 6 MHz range between 8.831496 and 8.83803 GHz. This corresponds to a previously unprobed mass range between 36.52413 and 36.5511 $\mu$eV. We don't observe any excess in the power spectrum and set limits on the axion-photon coupling in this mass range down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} &lt; 0.861 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with the confidence level set at $90\%$.</description>

      <title>Radiation Hardness Studies of RPC Based on Diamond-Like Carbon Electrodes for MEG II Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel type of resistive plate chamber, based on diamond-like carbon (DLC) electrodes is under development for background identification in the MEG II experiment. The DLC-RPC is required to have a radiation hardness to mass irradiation since it is planned to be placed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. In this study, the aging test using a high-intensity X-ray beam was conducted to evaluate the radiation hardness of the DLC-RPC. The accumulated charge due to X-ray irradiation reached about 54 C/cm$^2$, which is approximately half of the one-year irradiation dose expected in the MEG II experiment. As a result, the degradation of the gas gain was observed due to fluorine deposition and insulators formed on the DLC electrodes. In addition, discharges via spacers were also observed repeatedly and interrupted the DLC-RPC operation.</description>

      <title>Review of the high-power vacuum tube microwave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.04288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the first vacuum tube (X-ray tube) was invented by Wilhelm R\"ontgen in Germany, after more than one hundred years of development, the average power density of the vacuum tube microwave source has reached the order of 108 [MW][GHz]2. The maximum power density record was created by the Free Electron Lasers. In the high-power microwave field, the vacuum devices are still the mainstream microwave sources for applications such as scientific instruments, communications, radars, magnetic confinement fusion heating, microwave weapons, etc. The principles of microwave generation by vacuum tube microwave sources include Cherenkov or Smith-Purcell radiation, transition radiation, and Bremsstrahlung. In this paper, the vacuum tube microwave sources were reviewed in order according to the three radiation principles. Among them, the Vircators can produce 22 GW output power in P-band (0.23-1GHz). Vacuum tubes that can achieve continuous-wave operation include Traveling Wave Tubes, Klystrons, Free Electron Lasers, and Magnetrons, with output power up to 1MW. Vacuum tubes that can generate frequencies of the order of 100 GHz and above include Klystrons, Traveling Wave Tubes, Gyrotrons, Backward Wave Oscillators, Magnetrons, Surface Wave Oscillators, Free Electron Lasers, Orotrons, etc. Gyrotrons are very attractive in the millimeter wave and THz fields. The Gyrotrons can output power at the MW level with 3000s pulse width at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis Methods Preliminaries for a Photon-based Hardware Random Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High quality random numbers are necessary in the modern world. Ranging from encryption keys in cyber security to models and simulations for scientific use: it's important that these random numbers are of high quality and quickly attainable. One common solution to the generation of random numbers is that of pseudo-random number generators, or PRNGs. PRNGs generate random numbers by first quantifying some unpredictable phenomena into a number or string and feeding it into an algorithm which yields numbers randomly based on that seed. Easy places to find seeds include the user's mouse movements or the machine's uptime. These are only pseudorandom, however, as if given the same seed twice, the PRNG would generate the same 'random' output. This is great for games like Minecraft, but not so great for cybersecurity encryption key generation. By using a hardware random number generator (HRNG), random numbers that are not susceptible to the flaws found in PRNGs can be attained at a high rate.</description>

      <title>A 25-micron single photon sensitive kinetic inductance detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report measurements characterizing the performance of a kinetic inductance detector array designed for a wavelength of 25 microns and very low optical background level suitable for applications such as a far-infrared instrument on a cryogenically cooled space telescope. In a pulse counting mode of operation at low optical flux, the detectors can resolve individual 25-micron photons. In an integrating mode, the detectors remain photon noise limited over more than six orders of magnitude in absorbed power from 70 zW to 200 fW, with a limiting NEP of 4.6 x 10^-20 W/rtHz at 1 Hz. In addition, the detectors are highly stable with flat power spectra under optical load down to 1 mHz. Operational parameters of the detector are determined including the efficiency of conversion of the incident optical power into quasiparticles in the aluminum absorbing element and the quasiparticle self-recombination constant.</description>
