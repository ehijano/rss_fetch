      <title>SVEMnet: An R package for Self-Validated Elastic-Net Ensembles and Multi-Response Optimization in Small-Sample Mixture--Process Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SVEMnet is an R package for fitting Self-Validated Ensemble Models (SVEM) with elastic-net base learners and for performing multi-response optimization in small-sample mixture--process design-of-experiments (DOE) studies with numeric, categorical, and mixture factors. SVEMnet wraps elastic-net and relaxed elastic-net models for Gaussian and binomial responses from glmnet in a fractional random-weight (FRW) resampling scheme with anti-correlated train/validation weights; penalties are selected by validation-weighted AIC- and BIC-type criteria, and predictions are averaged across replicates to stabilize fits near the interpolation boundary. In addition to the core SVEM engine, the package provides deterministic high-order formula expansion, a permutation-based whole-model test heuristic, and a mixture-constrained random-search optimizer that combines Derringer--Suich desirability functions, bootstrap-based uncertainty summaries, and optional mean-level specification-limit probabilities to generate scored candidate tables and diverse exploitation and exploration medoids for sequential fit--score--run--refit workflows. A simulated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation study illustrates these tools in a small-sample mixture--process DOE setting, and simulation experiments based on sparse quadratic response surfaces benchmark SVEMnet against repeated cross-validated elastic-net baselines.</description>

      <title>Nested ensemble Kalman filter for static parameter inference in nonlinear state-space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a popular technique for performing inference in state-space models (SSMs), particularly when the dynamic process is high-dimensional. Unlike reweighting methods such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, i.e. particle filters), the EnKF leverages either the linear Gaussian structure of the SSM or an approximation thereof, to maintain diversity of the sampled latent states (the so-called ensemble members) via shifting-based updates. Joint parameter and state inference using an EnKF is typically achieved by augmenting the state vector with the static parameter. In this case, it is assumed that both parameters and states follow a linear Gaussian state-space model, which may be unreasonable in practice. In this paper, we combine the reweighting and shifting methods by replacing the particle filter used in the SMC^2 algorithm of Chopin et al., with the ensemble Kalman filter. Hence, parameter particles are weighted according to the estimated observed-data likelihood from the latest observation computed by the EnKF, and particle diversity is maintained via a resample-move step that targets the marginal parameter posterior under the EnKF. Extensions to the resulting algorithm are proposed, such as the use of a delayed acceptance kernel in the rejuvenation step and incorporation of nonlinear observation models. We illustrate the resulting methodology via several applications.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of robustness in modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a flexible approach to approximate sampling from intractable probability distributions, with a rich theoretical foundation and comprising a wealth of exemplar algorithms. While the qualitative correctness of MCMC algorithms is often easy to ensure, their practical efficiency is contingent on the `target' distribution being reasonably well-behaved.
  In this work, we concern ourself with the scenario in which this good behaviour is called into question, reviewing an emerging line of work on `robust' MCMC algorithms which can perform acceptably even in the face of certain pathologies.
  We focus on two particular pathologies which, while simple, can already have dramatic effects on standard `local' algorithms. The first is roughness, whereby the target distribution varies so rapidly that the numerical stability of the algorithm is tenuous. The second is flatness, whereby the landscape of the target distribution is instead so barren and uninformative that one becomes lost in uninteresting parts of the state space. In each case, we formulate the pathology in concrete terms, review a range of proposed algorithmic remedies to the pathology, and outline promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Efficient bayesian spatially varying coefficients modeling for censored data using the vecchia approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially varying coefficients (SVC) models allow for marginal effects to be non-stationary over space and thus offer a higher degree of flexibility with respect to standard geostatistical models with external drift. At the same time, SVC models have the advantage that they are easily interpretable. They offer a flexible framework for understanding how the relationships between dependent and independent variables vary across space. The most common methods for modelling such data are the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Bayesian Gaussian Process (Bayes-GP). The Bayesian SVC model, which assumes that the coefficients follow Gaussian processes, provides a rigorous approach to account for spatial non-stationarity. However, the computational cost of Bayes-GP models can be prohibitively high when dealing with large datasets or/and when using a large number of covariates, due to the repeated inversion of dense covariance matrices required at each Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration. In this study, we propose an efficient Bayes-GP modeling framework leveraging the Vecchia approximation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The proposed method is applied to a challenging soil pollution data set in Toulouse, France, characterized by a high degree of censorship (two-thirds censored observations) and spatial clustering. Our results demonstrate the ability of the Vecchia-based Bayes-GP model to capture spatially varying effects and provide meaningful insights into spatial heterogeneity, even under the constraints of censored data.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Unavoidable A Priori: A Framework for Comparative Causal Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform-Grid Markov Chain Approximation of Continuous Processes with Time-Linear Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.</description>
