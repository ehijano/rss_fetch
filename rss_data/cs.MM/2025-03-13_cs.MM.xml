      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimizing QoE-Privacy Tradeoff for Proactive VR Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactive virtual reality (VR) streaming requires users to upload viewpoint-related information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing strategies preserve privacy by introducing errors to viewpoints, which, however, compromises the quality of experience (QoE) of users. In this paper, we first delve into the analysis of the viewpoint leakage probability achieved by existing privacy-preserving approaches. We determine the optimal distribution of viewpoint errors that minimizes the viewpoint leakage probability. Our analyses show that existing approaches cannot fully eliminate viewpoint leakage. Then, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach that introduces noise to uploaded viewpoint prediction errors, which can ensure zero viewpoint leakage probability. Given the proposed approach, the tradeoff between privacy preservation and QoE is optimized to minimize the QoE loss while satisfying the privacy requirement. Simulation results validate our analysis results and demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a promising solution for balancing privacy and QoE.</description>

      <title>Prompt-OT: An Optimal Transport Regularization Paradigm for Knowledge Preservation in Vision-Language Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

      <title>InteractEdit: Zero-Shot Editing of Human-Object Interactions in Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents InteractEdit, a novel framework for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) editing, addressing the challenging task of transforming an existing interaction in an image into a new, desired interaction while preserving the identities of the subject and object. Unlike simpler image editing scenarios such as attribute manipulation, object replacement or style transfer, HOI editing involves complex spatial, contextual, and relational dependencies inherent in humans-objects interactions. Existing methods often overfit to the source image structure, limiting their ability to adapt to the substantial structural modifications demanded by new interactions. To address this, InteractEdit decomposes each scene into subject, object, and background components, then employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and selective fine-tuning to preserve pretrained interaction priors while learning the visual identity of the source image. This regularization strategy effectively balances interaction edits with identity consistency. We further introduce IEBench, the most comprehensive benchmark for HOI editing, which evaluates both interaction editing and identity preservation. Our extensive experiments show that InteractEdit significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for future HOI editing research and unlocking new possibilities for creative and practical applications. Code will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Generative Frame Sampler for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), effectively understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge. Perceiving lengthy videos containing thousands of frames poses substantial computational burden. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces Generative Frame Sampler (GenS), a plug-and-play module integrated with VideoLLMs to facilitate efficient lengthy video perception. Built upon a lightweight VideoLLM, GenS leverages its inherent vision-language capabilities to identify question-relevant frames. To facilitate effective retrieval, we construct GenS-Video-150K, a large-scale video instruction dataset with dense frame relevance annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenS consistently boosts the performance of various VideoLLMs, including open-source models (Qwen2-VL-7B, Aria-25B, VILA-40B, LLaVA-Video-7B/72B) and proprietary assistants (GPT-4o, Gemini). When equipped with GenS, open-source VideoLLMs achieve impressive state-of-the-art results on long-form video benchmarks: LLaVA-Video-72B reaches 66.8 (+4.3) on LongVideoBench and 77.0 (+2.7) on MLVU, while Aria obtains 39.2 on HourVideo surpassing the Gemini-1.5-pro by 1.9 points. We will release all datasets and models at https://generative-sampler.github.io.</description>

      <title>Memory-enhanced Retrieval Augmentation for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) shows strong potential in addressing long-video understanding (LVU) tasks. However, traditional RAG methods remain fundamentally limited due to their dependence on explicit search queries, which are unavailable in many situations. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel RAG-based LVU approach inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings, which is called MemVid. Our approach operates with four basics steps: memorizing holistic video information, reasoning about the task's information needs based on the memory, retrieving critical moments based on the information needs, and focusing on the retrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's memory-grounded reasoning capabilities and achieve optimal end-to-end performance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins with supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then progressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through reinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench. In our experiment, MemVid significantly outperforms existing RAG-based methods and popular LVU models, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our model and source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>GenHPE: Generative Counterfactuals for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Radio Frequency Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for various applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.</description>

      <title>MERGE -- A Bimodal Dataset for Static Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a severe lack of public and sizeable bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively called MERGE, created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. In addition, we propose and validate fixed train-validate-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 79.21% F1-score for bimodal classification using a deep neural network.</description>

      <title>Parallel Backpropagation for Inverse of a Convolution with Application to Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use the Inverse of Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm to optimize the inverse of the convolution layer, resulting in fast training times. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Daily Practice in Intangible Cultural Heritage through Virtual Reality: A Case Study of Traditional Chinese Flower Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The essence of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) lies in the living knowledge and skills passed down through generations. Daily practice plays a vital role in revitalizing ICH by fostering continuous learning and improvement. However, limited resources and accessibility pose significant challenges to sustaining such practice. Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in supporting extensive skill training. Unlike technical skill training, ICH daily practice prioritizes cultivating a deeper understanding of cultural meanings and values. This study explores VR's potential in facilitating ICH daily practice through a case study of Traditional Chinese Flower Arrangement (TCFA). By investigating TCFA learners' challenges and expectations, we designed and evaluated FloraJing, a VR system enriched with cultural elements to support sustained TCFA practice. Findings reveal that FloraJing promotes progressive reflection, and continuous enhances technical improvement and cultural understanding. We further propose design implications for VR applications aimed at fostering ICH daily practice in both knowledge and skills.</description>

      <title>CalliReader: Contextualizing Chinese Calligraphy via an Embedding-Aligned Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chinese calligraphy, a UNESCO Heritage, remains computationally challenging due to visual ambiguity and cultural complexity. Existing AI systems fail to contextualize their intricate scripts, because of limited annotated data and poor visual-semantic alignment. We propose CalliReader, a vision-language model (VLM) that solves the Chinese Calligraphy Contextualization (CC$^2$) problem through three innovations: (1) character-wise slicing for precise character extraction and sorting, (2) CalliAlign for visual-text token compression and alignment, (3) embedding instruction tuning (e-IT) for improving alignment and addressing data scarcity. We also build CalliBench, the first benchmark for full-page calligraphic contextualization, addressing three critical issues in previous OCR and VQA approaches: fragmented context, shallow reasoning, and hallucination. Extensive experiments including user studies have been conducted to verify our CalliReader's \textbf{superiority to other state-of-the-art methods and even human professionals in page-level calligraphy recognition and interpretation}, achieving higher accuracy while reducing hallucination. Comparisons with reasoning models highlight the importance of accurate recognition as a prerequisite for reliable comprehension. Quantitative analyses validate CalliReader's efficiency; evaluations on document and real-world benchmarks confirm its robust generalization ability.</description>

      <title>REArtGS: Reconstructing and Generating Articulated Objects via 3D Gaussian Splatting with Geometric and Motion Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Articulated objects, as prevalent entities in human life, their 3D representations play crucial roles across various applications. However, achieving both high-fidelity textured surface reconstruction and dynamic generation for articulated objects remains challenging for existing methods. In this paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional geometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling high-quality textured surface reconstruction and generation for articulated objects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of articulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF) guidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints and improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable fields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated objects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given states, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states. Codes will be released within the next four months and the project website is at https://sites.google.com/view/reartgs/home.</description>
