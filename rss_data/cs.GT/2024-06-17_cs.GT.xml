      <title>Ad Auctions for LLMs via Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of computational advertising, the integration of ads into the outputs of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to support these services without compromising content integrity. This paper introduces novel auction mechanisms for ad allocation and pricing within the textual outputs of LLMs, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a segment auction where an ad is probabilistically retrieved for each discourse segment (paragraph, section, or entire output) according to its bid and relevance, following the RAG framework, and priced according to competing bids. We show that our auction maximizes logarithmic social welfare, a new notion of welfare that balances allocation efficiency and fairness, and we characterize the associated incentive-compatible pricing rule. These results are extended to multi-ad allocation per segment. An empirical evaluation validates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach over several ad auction scenarios, and exhibits inherent tradeoffs in metrics as we allow the LLM more flexibility to allocate ads.</description>

      <title>Fair and Efficient Completion of Indivisible Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the problem of fair and efficient completion of indivisible goods, defined as follows: Given a partial allocation of indivisible goods among agents, does there exist an allocation of the remaining goods (i.e., a completion) that satisfies fairness and economic efficiency guarantees of interest? We study the computational complexity of the completion problem for prominent fairness and efficiency notions such as envy-freeness up one good (EF1), proportionality up to one good (Prop1), maximin share (MMS), and Pareto optimality (PO), and focus on the class of additive valuations as well as its subclasses such as binary additive and lexicographic valuations. We find that while the completion problem is significantly harder than the standard fair division problem (wherein the initial partial allocation is empty), the consideration of restricted preferences facilitates positive algorithmic results for threshold-based fairness notions (Prop1 and MMS). On the other hand, the completion problem remains computationally intractable for envy-based notions such as EF1 and EF1+PO even under restricted preferences.</description>

      <title>The Cost and Complexity of Minimizing Envy in House Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study almost-envy-freeness in house allocation, where $m$ houses are to be allocated among $n$ agents so that every agent receives exactly one house. An envy-free allocation need not exist, and therefore we may have to settle for relaxations of envy-freeness. But typical relaxations such as envy-free up to one good do not make sense for house allocation, as every agent is required to receive exactly one house. Hence we turn to different aggregate measures of envy as markers of fairness. In particular, we define the amount of envy experienced by an agent $a$ w.r.t. an allocation to be the number of agents that agent $a$ envies under that allocation. We quantify the envy generated by an allocation using three different metrics: 1) the number of agents who are envious; 2) the maximum amount of envy experienced by any agent; and 3) the total amount of envy experienced by all agents, and look for allocations that minimize one of the three metrics. We thus study three computational problems corresponding to each of the three metrics and prove a host of algorithmic and hardness results. We also suggest practical approaches for these problems via integer linear program (ILP) formulations and report the findings of our experimental evaluation of ILPs. Finally, we study the price of fairness (PoF), which quantifies the loss of welfare we must suffer due to the fairness requirements, and we prove a number of results on PoF, including tight bounds as well as algorithms that simultaneously optimize both welfare and fairness.</description>

      <title>Finding pure Nash equilibria in large random games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Best Response Dynamics (BRD) is a class of strategy updating rules to find Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) in a game. At each step, a player is randomly picked and they switches to a "best response" strategy based on the strategies chosen by others, so that the new strategy profile maximises their payoff. If no such strategy exists, a different player will be chosen randomly. When no player wants to change their strategy anymore, the process reaches a PNE and will not deviate from it. On the other hand, either PNE could not exist, or BRD could be "trapped" within a subgame that has no PNE. We prove that BRD typically converges to PNE when the game has $N$ players, each having two actions. Our results are more general and are described as follows. We study a class of random walks in a random medium on the $N$-dimensional hypercube. The medium is determined by a random game with $N$ players, each with two actions available, and i.i.d. payoffs. The medium contains obstacles that can be of two types. The first type is composed of the PNE of the game, while the other obstacles are known in the literature as traps or sink equilibria. The class of processes we analyze includes BRD, simple random walks on the hypercube, and many other nearest neighbour processes. We prove that, with high probability, these processes reach a PNE before hitting any trap.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Learning in State-based Potential Games for Self-Learning Production Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce novel gradient-based optimization methods for state-based potential games (SbPGs) within self-learning distributed production systems. SbPGs are recognised for their efficacy in enabling self-optimizing distributed multi-agent systems and offer a proven convergence guarantee, which facilitates collaborative player efforts towards global objectives. Our study strives to replace conventional ad-hoc random exploration-based learning in SbPGs with contemporary gradient-based approaches, which aim for faster convergence and smoother exploration dynamics, thereby shortening training duration while upholding the efficacy of SbPGs. Moreover, we propose three distinct variants for estimating the objective function of gradient-based learning, each developed to suit the unique characteristics of the systems under consideration. To validate our methodology, we apply it to a laboratory testbed, namely Bulk Good Laboratory Plant, which represents a smart and flexible distributed multi-agent production system. The incorporation of gradient-based learning in SbPGs reduces training times and achieves more optimal policies than its baseline.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Facility Location Games with Strategic Clients and Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.01425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-cooperative facility location games where both facilities and clients act strategically and heavily influence each other. This contrasts established game-theoretic facility location models with non-strategic clients that simply select the closest opened facility. In our model, every facility location has a set of attracted clients and each client has a set of shopping locations and a weight that corresponds to her spending capacity. Facility agents selfishly select a location for opening their facility to maximize the attracted total spending capacity, whereas clients strategically decide how to distribute their spending capacity among the opened facilities in their shopping range. We focus on a natural client behavior similar to classical load balancing: our selfish clients aim for a distribution that minimizes their maximum waiting times for getting serviced, where a facility's waiting time corresponds to its total attracted client weight.
  We show that subgame perfect equilibria exist and give almost tight constant bounds on the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability, which even hold for a broader class of games with arbitrary client behavior. Since facilities and clients influence each other, it is crucial for the facilities to anticipate the selfish clients' behavior when selecting their location. For this, we provide an efficient algorithm that also implies an efficient check for equilibrium. Finally, we show that computing a socially optimal facility placement is NP-hard and that this result holds for all feasible client weight distributions.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Kidney Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In kidney exchange programs, multiple patient-donor pairs each of whom are otherwise incompatible, exchange their donors to receive compatible kidneys. The Kidney Exchange problem is typically modelled as a directed graph where every vertex is either an altruistic donor or a pair of patient and donor; directed edges are added from a donor to its compatible patients. The computational task is to find if there exists a collection of disjoint cycles and paths starting from altruistic donor vertices of length at most l_c and l_p respectively that covers at least some specific number t of non-altruistic vertices (patients). We study parameterized algorithms for the kidney exchange problem in this paper. Specifically, we design FPT algorithms parameterized by each of the following parameters: (1) the number of patients who receive kidney, (2) treewidth of the input graph + max{l_p, l_c}, and (3) the number of vertex types in the input graph when l_p &lt;= l_c. We also present interesting algorithmic and hardness results on the kernelization complexity of the problem. Finally, we present an approximation algorithm for an important special case of Kidney Exchange.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Nash Social Welfare in 2-Value Instances: Delineating Tractability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10949v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among a set of agents with \emph{2-value additive valuations}. In this setting, each good is valued either $1$ or $\sfrac{p}{q}$, for some fixed co-prime numbers $p,q\in \NN$ such that $1\leq q &lt; p$. Our goal is to find an allocation maximizing the \emph{Nash social welfare} (\NSW), i.e., the geometric mean of the valuations of the agents. In this work, we give a complete characterization of polynomial-time tractability of \NSW\ maximization that solely depends on the values of $q$.
  We start by providing a rather simple polynomial-time algorithm to find a maximum \NSW\ allocation when the valuation functions are \emph{integral}, that is, $q=1$. We then exploit more involved techniques to get an algorithm producing a maximum \NSW\ allocation for the \emph{half-integral} case, that is, $q=2$. Finally, we show it is \classNP-hard to compute an allocation with maximum \NSW\ whenever $q\geq3$.</description>
