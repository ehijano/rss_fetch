      <title>Semantic knowledge guides innovation and drives cultural evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cumulative cultural evolution enables human societies to generate increasingly complex knowledge and technology over generations. While social learning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the cognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between concepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative innovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We tested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed a task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both approaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to enhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative culture.</description>

      <title>KVCOMM: Online Cross-context KV-cache Communication for Efficient LLM-based Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.</description>

      <title>Agentic Discovery: Closing the Loop with Cooperative Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data-driven methods, artificial intelligence (AI), and automated workflows accelerate scientific tasks, we see the rate of discovery increasingly limited by human decision-making tasks such as setting objectives, generating hypotheses, and designing experiments. We postulate that cooperative agents are needed to augment the role of humans and enable autonomous discovery. Realizing such agents will require progress in both AI and infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Altruistic Ride Sharing: A Community-Driven Approach to Short-Distance Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban mobility faces persistent challenges of congestion and fuel consumption, specifically when people choose a private, point-to-point commute option. Profit-driven ride-sharing platforms prioritize revenue over fairness and sustainability. This paper introduces Altruistic Ride-Sharing (ARS), a decentralized, peer-to-peer mobility framework where participants alternate between driver and rider roles based on altruism points rather than monetary incentives. The system integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADDPG) for dynamic ride-matching, game-theoretic equilibrium guarantees for fairness, and a population model to sustain long-term balance. Using real-world New York City taxi data, we demonstrate that ARS reduces travel distance and emissions, increases vehicle utilization, and promotes equitable participation compared to both no-sharing and optimization-based baselines. These results establish ARS as a scalable, community-driven alternative to conventional ride-sharing, aligning individual behavior with collective urban sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>AOAD-MAT: Transformer-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model considering agents' order of action decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.</description>

      <title>Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial. While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance. Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting: all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate), while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in routing games with connected autonomous vehicles will not be strong, as exclusive clubs may form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User Equilibrium is the standard representation of the so-called routing game in which drivers adjust their route choices to arrive at their destinations as fast as possible. Asking whether this Equilibrium is strong or not was meaningless for human drivers who did not form coalitions due to technical and behavioral constraints. This is no longer the case for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which will be able to communicate and collaborate to jointly form routing coalitions.
  We demonstrate this for the first time on a carefully designed toy-network example, where a `club` of three autonomous vehicles jointly decides to deviate from the user equilibrium and benefit (arrive faster). The formation of such a club has negative consequences for other users, who are not invited to join it and now travel longer, and for the system, making it suboptimal and disequilibrated, which triggers adaptation dynamics.
  This discovery has profound implications for the future of our cities. We demonstrate that, if not prevented, CAV operators may intentionally disequilibrate traffic systems from their classic Nash equilibria, benefiting their own users and imposing costs on others. These findings suggest the possible emergence of an exclusive CAV elite, from which human-driven vehicles and non-coalition members may be excluded, potentially leading to systematically longer travel times for those outside the coalition, which would be harmful for the equity of public road networks.</description>

      <title>UNCAP: Uncertainty-Guided Planning Using Natural Language Communication for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31% increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

      <title>Addressing the alignment problem in transportation policy making: an LLM approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in transportation decision-making.</description>

      <title>Foragax: An Agent-Based Modelling Framework Based on JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06345v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foraging for resources is a ubiquitous activity conducted by living organisms in a shared environment to maintain their homeostasis. Modelling multi-agent foraging in-silico allows us to study both individual and collective emergent behaviour in a tractable manner. Agent-based modelling has proven to be effective in simulating such tasks, though scaling the simulations to accommodate large numbers of agents with complex dynamics remains challenging. In this work, we present Foragax, a general-purpose, scalable, hardware-accelerated, multi-agent foraging toolkit. Leveraging the JAX library, our toolkit can simulate thousands of agents foraging in a common environment, in an end-to-end vectorized and differentiable manner. The toolkit provides agent-based modelling tools to model various foraging tasks, including options to design custom spatial and temporal agent dynamics, control policies, sensor models, and boundary conditions. Further, the number of agents during such simulations can be increased or decreased based on custom rules. While applied to foraging, the toolkit can also be used to model and simulate a wide range of other multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

      <description>arXiv:2504.04160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of satellites and orbital debris has made space congestion a critical issue, threatening satellite safety and sustainability. Challenges such as collision avoidance, station-keeping, and orbital maneuvering require advanced techniques to handle dynamic uncertainties and multi-agent interactions. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, enabling adaptive, autonomous policies for space operations; however, many existing RL frameworks rely on custom-built environments developed from scratch, which often use simplified models and require significant time to implement and validate the orbital dynamics, limiting their ability to fully capture real-world complexities. To address this, we introduce OrbitZoo, a versatile multi-agent RL environment built on a high-fidelity industry standard library, that enables realistic data generation, supports scenarios like collision avoidance and cooperative maneuvers, and ensures robust and accurate orbital dynamics. The environment is validated against a real satellite constellation, Starlink, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.16% compared to real-world data. This validation ensures reliability for generating high-fidelity simulations and enabling autonomous and independent satellite operations.</description>

      <title>Constant-Memory Strategies in Stochastic Games: Best Responses and Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic games have become a prevalent framework for studying long-term multi-agent interactions, especially in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the concept of constant-memory strategies in stochastic games. We first establish some results on best responses and Nash equilibria for behavioral constant-memory strategies, followed by a discussion on the computational hardness of best responding to mixed constant-memory strategies. Those theoretic insights are later verified on several sequential decision-making testbeds, including the $\textit{Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma}$, the $\textit{Iterated Traveler's Dilemma}$, and the $\textit{Pursuit}$ domain. This work aims to enhance the understanding of theoretical issues in single-agent planning under multi-agent systems, and uncover the connection between decision models in single-agent and multi-agent contexts.

      <title>GUARDIAN: Safeguarding LLM Multi-Agent Collaborations with Temporal Graph Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues. However, multi-agent collaboration faces critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns.

      <title>Evolution of AI Agent Registry Solutions: Centralized, Enterprise, and Distributed Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03095</link>

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents now operate across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized domains, creating demand for registry infrastructures that enable trustworthy discovery, capability negotiation, and identity assurance. We analyze five prominent approaches: (1) MCP Registry (centralized publication of mcp.json descriptors), (2) A2A Agent Cards (decentralized self-describing JSON capability manifests), (3) AGNTCY Agent Directory Service (IPFS Kademlia DHT content routing extended for semantic taxonomy-based content discovery, OCI artifact storage, and Sigstore-backed integrity), (4) Microsoft Entra Agent ID (enterprise SaaS directory with policy and zero-trust integration), and (5) NANDA Index AgentFacts (cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving fact model with credentialed assertions). Using four evaluation dimensions: security, authentication, scalability, and maintainability, we surface architectural trade-offs between centralized control, enterprise governance, and distributed resilience. We conclude with design recommendations for an emerging Internet of AI Agents requiring verifiable identity, adaptive discovery flows, and interoperable capability semantics.</description>

      <title>MACTAS: Self-Attention-Based Module for Inter-Agent Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC and SMACv2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of maps.</description>

      <title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information-processing systems that coordinate multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have a much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</description>
