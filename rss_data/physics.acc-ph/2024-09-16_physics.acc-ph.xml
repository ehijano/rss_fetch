      <title>A General Bayesian Algorithm for the Autonomous Alignment of Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous methods to align beamlines can decrease the amount of time spent on diagnostics, and also uncover better global optima leading to better beam quality. The alignment of these beamlines is a high-dimensional, expensive-to-sample optimization problem involving the simultaneous treatment of many optical elements with correlated and nonlinear dynamics. Bayesian optimization is a strategy of efficient global optimization that has proved successful in similar regimes in a wide variety of beamline alignment applications, though it has typically been implemented for particular beamlines and optimization tasks. In this paper, we present a basic formulation of Bayesian inference and Gaussian process models as they relate to multiobjective Bayesian optimization, as well as the practical challenges presented by beamline alignment. We show that the same general implementation of Bayesian optimization with special consideration for beamline alignment can quickly learn the dynamics of particular beamlines in an online fashion through hyperparameter fitting with no prior information. We present the implementation of a concise software framework for beamline alignment and test it on four different optimization problems for experiments at x-ray beamlines of the National Synchrotron Light Source II and the Advanced Light Source and an electron beam at the Accelerator Test Facility, along with benchmarking on a simulated digital twin. We discuss new applications of the framework, and the potential for a unified approach to beamline alignment at synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

      <title>Thermal fluid closures and pressure anisotropies in numerical simulations of plasma wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of plasma-based acceleration processes with collisionless particle dynamics and non negligible thermal effects. We aim at assessing the applicability of fluid-like models, obtained by suitable closure assumptions applied to the relativistic kinetic equations, thus not suffering of statistical noise, even in presence of a finite temperature. The work here presented focuses on the characterization of pressure anisotropies, which crucially depend on the adopted closure scheme, and hence are useful to discern the appropriate thermal fluid model. To this aim, simulation results of spatially resolved fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions are compared with the results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations at changing temperature and amplitude of plasma oscillations.</description>
