      <title>Pairs Trading Using a Novel Graphical Matching Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairs trading, a strategy that capitalizes on price movements of asset pairs driven by similar factors, has gained significant popularity among traders. Common practice involves selecting highly cointegrated pairs to form a portfolio, which often leads to the inclusion of multiple pairs sharing common assets. This approach, while intuitive, inadvertently elevates portfolio variance and diminishes risk-adjusted returns by concentrating on a small number of highly cointegrated assets. Our study introduces an innovative pair selection method employing graphical matchings designed to tackle this challenge. We model all assets and their cointegration levels with a weighted graph, where edges signify pairs and their weights indicate the extent of cointegration. A portfolio of pairs is a subgraph of this graph. We construct a portfolio which is a maximum weighted matching of this graph to select pairs which have strong cointegration while simultaneously ensuring that there are no shared assets within any pair of pairs. This approach ensures each asset is included in just one pair, leading to a significantly lower variance in the matching-based portfolio compared to a baseline approach that selects pairs purely based on cointegration. Theoretical analysis and empirical testing using data from the S\&amp;P 500 between 2017 and 2023, affirm the efficacy of our method. Notably, our matching-based strategy showcases a marked improvement in risk-adjusted performance, evidenced by a gross Sharpe ratio of 1.23, a significant enhancement over the baseline value of 0.48 and market value of 0.59. Additionally, our approach demonstrates reduced trading costs attributable to lower turnover, alongside minimized single asset risk due to a more diversified asset base.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Microcanonical Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08362</link>

Abstract: Microcanonical gradient descent is a sampling procedure for energy-based models allowing for efficient sampling of distributions in high dimension. It works by transporting samples from a high-entropy distribution, such as Gaussian white noise, to a low-energy region using gradient descent. We put this model in the framework of normalizing flows, showing how it can often overfit by losing an unnecessary amount of entropy in the descent. As a remedy, we propose a mean-field microcanonical gradient descent that samples several weakly coupled data points simultaneously, allowing for better control of the entropy loss while paying little in terms of likelihood fit. We study these models in the context of financial time series, illustrating the improvements on both synthetic and real data.</description>
