      <title>Cell closures for two-row Springer fibers via noncrossing matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Springer fibers are a family of subvarieties of the flag variety parametrized by nilpotent matrices that are important in geometric representation theory and whose geometry encodes deep combinatorics. Two-row Springer fibers, which correspond to nilpotent matrices with two Jordan blocks, also arise in knot theory, in part because their components are indexed by noncrossing matchings. Springer fibers are paved by affines by intersection with appropriately-chosen Schubert cells. In the two-row case, we provide an elementary description of these Springer Schubert cells in terms of standard noncrossing matchings and describe closure relations explicitly. To do this, we define an operation called cutting arcs in a matching, which successively unnests arcs while ``remembering" the arc originally on top. We then prove that the boundary of the Springer Schubert cell corresponding to a matching consists of the affine subsets of cells corresponding to all ways of cutting arcs in that matching.</description>

      <title>Volumes in Calabi-Yau Complete Intersection of Products of Projective Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the birational automorphism group of a general Calabi-yau complete intersection $X$ given by ample divisors in $\mathbb{P}^{n_1}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{P}^{n_l}$ is always Lorentzain. Applying the Kawamata-Morrison cone theorem on such $X$, we compute $\operatorname{vol}_X(D+sA)$ for any divisor $D\in \partial\overline{\operatorname{Eff}}(X)$ and ample divisor $A$ when $s$ is small. We also provide examples of volumes of certain Cartier divisors that involve the digamma function.</description>

      <title>On the irreducible components of some Brill-Noether loci of rank-two, stable bundles over a general $\nu$-gonal curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Brill-Noether loci of rank-two, stable vector bundles of given degree $d$, with speciality $2$ and $3$, on a general $\nu$-gonal curve $C$ of genus $g$ with the aim of studying their irreducible components in the whole range of interest for $d$, namely $2g-2 \leq d \leq 4g-4$.
  For speciality $2$, either we prove that such a Brill-Noether locus is empty or we completely classify all of its irreducible components, giving also some extra information about their dimensions (exhibiting both regular and superabundant components), about their birational geometry as well as giving precise description of their general point.
  Similarly, in speciality $3$, either we prove that such a Brill-Noether locus is empty or we exhibit irreducible components of several types according to their regularity or superabundance but also according to the precise descriptions of their general points, proving e.g. that in some degrees $d$ there are more than one superabundant component together with the presence of also a regular component. We moreover give extra information about the birational geometry of the constructed components as well as about their local behavior.
  As a by-product of our general results, we deduce also some consequences on Brill-Noether loci in rank two with fixed general determinant line bundle instead of fixed degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main result is to show that the existence of a root in. --$\alpha$--Nfor the p-th Bernstein polynomial of the (a,b)-module generated by a holomorphicform in the (convergent) Brieskorn (a,b)-module associated to f, under the hypothesis that f has an isolated singularity at the origin relative to the eigenvalue exp(2i$\pi$$\alpha$) of the monodromy, produces poles of order at least p for themeromorphic extension of the (conjugate) analytic functional given by polar partsat points--$\alpha$--N for N  well chosen integer. This result is new, even forp= 1. As a corollary, this implies that, in the case of an isolated singularity for f,the existence of a root in. --$\alpha$--N  for the p-th Bernstein polynomial of the (a,b)-module generated by a holomorphic form  implies the existence of at leastp roots (counting multiplicities) for the usual reduced Bernstein polynomial of thegerm of f at the origin.In the case of an isolated singularity for f, we obtain that for each $\alpha$ thebiggest root --$\alpha$--m. of the reduced Bernstein polynomial of f in --$\alpha$--N  producesa pole at--$\alpha$--m   for the meromorphic extension of the associated  distribution</description>

      <title>Algebraic growth of the Cremona group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the ''algebraic growth'' of groups of automorphisms and birational transformations of algebraic varieties. Our main result concerns $\text{Bir}(\mathbb{P}^2)$, the Cremona group in $2$ variables. This group is the union, for all degrees $d\geq 1$, of the algebraic variety $\text{Bir}(\mathbb{P}^2)_d$ of birational transformations of the plane of degree $d$. Let $N_d$ denote the number of irreducible components of $\text{Bir}(\mathbb{P}^2)_d$. We describe the asymptotic growth of $N_d$ as $d$ goes to $+\infty$, showing that there are two constants $A$ and $B&gt;0$ such that $$ A\sqrt{\ln(d)} \leq \ln \left(\ln \left(\sum_{e\leq d} N_e \right) \right) \leq B \sqrt{\ln(d)} $$ for all large enough degrees $d$. This growth type seems quite unusual and shows that computing the algebraic growth of $\text{Bir}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ is a challenging problem in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the homology of the Hurwitz space associated to an arbitrary finite rack stabilizes integrally in a suitable sense. We also compute the dominant part of its stable homology after inverting finitely many primes. This proves a conjecture of Ellenberg--Venkatesh--Westerland and improves upon our previous results for non-splitting racks. We obtain applications to Malle's conjecture, the Picard rank conjecture, and the Cohen--Lenstra--Martinet heuristics.</description>

      <title>PLMP -- Point-Line Minimal Problems for Projective SfM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We completely classify all minimal problems for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) where arrangements of points and lines are fully observed by multiple uncalibrated pinhole cameras. We find 291 minimal problems, 73 of which have unique solutions and can thus be solved linearly. Two of the linear problems allow an arbitrary number of views, while all other minimal problems have at most 9 cameras. All minimal problems have at most 7 points and at most 12 lines. We compute the number of solutions of each minimal problem, as this gives a measurement of the problem's intrinsic difficulty, and find that these number are relatively low (e.g., when comparing with minimal problems for calibrated cameras). Finally, by exploring stabilizer subgroups of subarrangements, we develop a geometric and systematic way to 1) factorize minimal problems into smaller problems, 2) identify minimal problems in underconstrained problems, and 3) formally prove non-minimality.</description>

      <title>On the derived Tate curve and global smooth Tate $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between equivariant stable homotopy theory and spectral algebraic geometry is used to construct a derived Tate curve over $\mathrm{KU}((q))$, a lift of the classical elliptic curve of Tate over $\mathbf{Z}((q))$. Applications of both an algebro-geometric and a topological flavour follow. First, we construct a spectral algebro-geometric model for the compactification of the moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves, giving a canonical choice of holomorphic topological $q$-expansion map. Then we define globally equivariant forms of Tate $K$-theory $\mathbf{KO}((q))$ and $\mathbf{KU}((q))$, and equip them with globally equivariant meromorphic topological $q$-expansion maps from global topological modular forms. Finally, we explore $C_2$-equivariant versions of global Tate $K$-theory and connect them with $C_2$-equivariant global topological modular forms with level structures.</description>

      <title>First-order methods on bounded-rank tensors converging to stationary points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Provably finding stationary points on bounded-rank tensors turns out to be an open problem [E. Levin, J. Kileel, and N. Boumal, Math. Program., 199 (2023), pp. 831--864] due to the inherent non-smoothness of the set of bounded-rank tensors. We resolve this problem by proposing two first-order methods with guaranteed convergence to stationary points. Specifically, we revisit the variational geometry of bounded-rank tensors and explicitly characterize its normal cones. Moreover, we propose gradient-related approximate projection methods that are provable to find stationary points, where the decisive ingredients are gradient-related vectors from tangent cones, line search along approximate projections, and rank-decreasing mechanisms near rank-deficient points. Numerical experiments on tensor completion validate that the proposed methods converge to stationary points across various rank parameters.</description>

Abstract: This article analyzes a key exchange protocol based on the triad tropical semiring, recently proposed by Jackson, J. and Perumal, R. We demonstrate that the triad tropical semiring is isomorphic to a circulant matrix over tropical numbers. Consequently, matrices in this semiring can be represented as tropical matrices. As a result, we conduct a cryptanalysis of the key exchange protocol using an algorithm introduced by Sulaiman Alhussaini, Craig Collett, and Sergei Sergeev to solve the double discrete logarithm problem over tropical matrices</description>

Abstract: We show that when $p$ is an odd prime, $K$ is an unramified finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ and $G$ is a pure inner form of a special orthogonal group or unitary group over $K$ that splits over an unramified extension, the Fargues--Scholze local Langlands correspondence for $G$ agrees with the semi-simplification of classical local Langlands correspondence. As applications, we construct an unambiguous local Langlands correspondence for even orthogonal groups, deduce Fargues' eigen-sheaf conjecture, and prove new torsion vanishing results for orthogonal and unitary Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>A Method for Establishing Asymptotically Accurate Bounds for Extremal Roots of Eulerian Polynomials Using Polynomial Stability Preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero polynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.</description>

      <title>MMP for Generalized Pairs on K\"ahler 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we define generalized pairs $(X, B+\boldsymbol{\beta})$ where $X$ is an analytic variety and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a b-(1,1) current. We then prove that almost all standard results of the MMP hold in this generality for compact K\"ahler varieties of dim $X\leq 3$. More specifically, we prove the cone theorem, existence of flips, existence of log terminal models, log canonical models and Mori fiber spaces, the geography of log canonical and log terminal models, etc.</description>

      <title>K-stability and large complex structure limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05291v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how, under suitable assumptions, a K\"ahler test configuration admits a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, giving a corresponding expression for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant as a residue pairing. We study the general behaviour of such mirror formulae under large scaling of the K\"ahler form. We exploit the observation that this scaling trivially preserves $K$-stability, but takes the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model to a large complex structure limit. In certain cases the mirror formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant simplify in this limit. We focus on a special type of limiting behaviour, when the Donaldson-Futaki invariant concentrates at a single critical point of the Landau-Ginzburg potential, and show that this leads to new formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant in terms of theta functions on the mirror. We provide a main application, which shows that such limiting behaviour actually occurs for test configurations in several nontrivial examples, both toric and non-toric, in the case of slope (in)stability for polarised surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the consistent completion of an initial scattering diagram in $M_{\mathbb{R}}$ (for a finite rank lattice $M$) can be expressed quite generally in terms of the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues of certain explicit meromorphic forms, by using the Maurer-Cartan asymptotic analysis developed by Chan-Leung-Ma and Leung-Ma-Young. A similar result holds for the associated theta functions.</description>

      <title>On Almost Strong Approximation in Reductive Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a slight weakening of the classical property of strong approximation, which we call almost strong approximation, for connected reductive algebraic group over global fields with respect to special sets of valuations. While nonsimply connected groups (in particular, all algebraic tori) always fail to have strong approximation - and even almost strong approximation -- with respect to any finite set of valuations, we show that under appropriate assumptions they do have almost strong approximation with respect to (infinite) tractable sets of valuations, i.e. those sets that contain all archimedean valuations and a generalized arithmetic progression minus a set having Dirichlet density zero. Almost strong approximation is likely to have a variety of applications, and as an example we use almost strong approximation for tori to extend the essential part of the result of Radhika and Raghunathan on the congruence subgroup problem for inner forms of type $\textsf{A}_n$ to all absolutely almost simple simply connected groups.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Sato theory modulo $p^m$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed prime integer $p &gt; 0$ we develop a notion of Bernstein-Sato polynomial for polynomials with $\mathbb{Z} / p^m$-coefficients, compatible with existing theory in the case $m = 1$. We show that the ``roots" of such polynomials are rational and we show that the negative roots agree with those of the mod-$p$ reduction. We give examples to show that, surprisingly, roots may be positive in this context. Moreover, our construction allows us to define a notion of ``strength" for roots by measuring $p$-torsion, and we show that ``strong" roots give rise to roots in characteristic zero through mod-$p$ reduction.</description>

      <title>Doubly isogenous curves of genus two with a rational action of $D_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ and $C'$ be curves over a finite field $K$, provided with embeddings $\iota$ and $\iota'$ into their Jacobian varieties. Let $D\to C$ and $D'\to C'$ be the pullbacks (via these embeddings) of the multiplication-by-$2$ maps on the Jacobians. We say that $(C,\iota)$ and $(C',\iota')$ are \emph{doubly isogenous} if $\mathrm{Jac}(C)$ and $\mathrm{Jac}(C')$ are isogenous over $K$ and $\mathrm{Jac}(D)$ and $\mathrm{Jac}(D')$ are isogenous over~$K$. When we restrict attention to the case where $C$ and $C'$ are curves of genus $2$ whose groups of $K$-rational automorphisms are isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_6$ of order $12$, we find many more doubly isogenous pairs than one would expect from reasonable heuristics.
  Our analysis of this overabundance of doubly isogenous curves over finite fields leads to the construction of a pair of doubly isogenous curves over a number field. That such a global example exists seems extremely surprising. We show that the Zilber--Pink conjecture implies that there can only be finitely many such examples. When we exclude reductions of this pair of global curves in our counts, we find that the data for the remaining curves is consistent with our original heuristic.
  Computationally, we find that doubly isogenous curves in our family of $D_6$ curves can be distinguished from one another by considering the isogeny classes of the Prym varieties of certain unramified covers of exponent $3$ and $4$.
  We discuss how our family of curves can be potentially be used to obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm to factor univariate polynomials over finite fields via an argument of Kayal and Poonen.</description>

      <title>SL(2,Z)-matrixizations of generalized Markov numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.</description>
