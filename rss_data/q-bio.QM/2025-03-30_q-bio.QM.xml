      <title>A Novel Framework for Comparing Combination Therapy Outcomes Using Mechanistic Graph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Predicting the efficacy of combination therapies is a critical challenge in clinical decision-making, particularly for diseases requiring multi-drug regimens. Traditional evidence synthesis methods, such as component network meta-analysis (cNMA), often face parameter explosion and limited interpretability, especially when modeling interaction effects between components.
  Objective: This article introduces a general Efficacy Comparison Framework (ECF), a mechanistically grounded system for predicting combination therapy outcomes. ECF integrates biological pathway-based abstractions with expert knowledge, optimized with quasi-rules derived from clinical trial data to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.
  Methods: ECF employs a disease pathogenesis graph to encode domain knowledge, reducing the parameter space through mechanistic functions and sparse network structures. Optimization may be performed using a loss function inspired by the Thurstone-Mosteller model, focusing on pairwise regimen comparisons. A pilot study was conducted for acne vulgaris to evaluate ECF's ability in both tested and untested comparisons.
  Results: In the acne vulgaris case study, the ECF-based model achieved 76% accuracy in predicting both tested and untested regimen outcomes, demonstrating statistically comparable performance across clinical trial data and expert dermatologist consensus (p = 0.977). The agreement between ECF and expert predictions was within the range of inter-expert agreement.
  Discussion: ECF aligns with recent advancements in network science and synergy prediction, leveraging principles of complementary targeting and biological plausibility. Its use of disease pathogenesis graphs offers a more interpretable and scalable alternative to existing models reliant on chemical similarity or protein-protein interaction (PPI) topology.</description>

      <title>PyUAT: Open-source Python framework for efficient and scalable cell tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking individual cells in live-cell imaging provides fundamental insights, inevitable for studying causes and consequences of phenotypic heterogeneity, responses to changing environmental conditions or stressors. Microbial cell tracking, characterized by stochastic cell movements and frequent cell divisions, remains a challenging task when imaging frame rates must be limited to avoid counterfactual results. A promising way to overcome this limitation is uncertainty-aware tracking (UAT), which uses statistical models, calibrated to empirically observed cell behavior, to predict likely cell associations. We present PyUAT, an efficient and modular Python implementation of UAT for tracking microbial cells in time-lapse imaging. We demonstrate its performance on a large 2D+t data set and investigate the influence of modular biological models and imaging intervals on the tracking performance. The open-source PyUAT software is available at https://github.com/JuBiotech/PyUAT, including example notebooks for immediate use in Google Colab.</description>

      <title>Leveraging partial coherence in interferometric microscopy to enhance nanoparticle detection sensitivity and throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric-based microscopies stand as powerful label-free approaches for monitoring and characterising chemical reactions and heterogeneous nanoparticle systems in real time with single particle sensitivity. Nevertheless, coherent artifacts, such as speckle and parasitic interferences, together with limited photon fluxes from spatially incoherent sources, pose an ongoing challenge in achieving both high sensitivity and throughput. In this study, we systematically characterise how partial coherence affects both the signal contrast and the background noise level; thus, it offers a route to improve the signal-to-noise ratio from single nanoparticles (NPs), irrespective of their size and composition; or the light source used. We first validate that lasers can be modified into partially coherent sources with performance matching that of spatially incoherent ones; while providing higher photon fluxes. Secondly, we demonstrate that tuning the degree of partial coherence not only enhances the detection sensitivity of both synthetic and biological NPs, but also affects how signal contrasts vary as a function of the focus position. Finally, we apply our findings to single-protein detection, confirming that these principles extend to differential imaging modalities, which deliver the highest sensitivity. Our results address a critical milestone in the detection of weakly scattering NPs in complex matrices, with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology, nanotechnology, chemical synthesis, and biosensing; ushering a new generation of microscopes that push both the sensitivity and throughput boundaries without requiring beam scanning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based one-shot data selection methods for training gene expression models. Unlike active learning, one-shot data selection predefines the gene perturbations before training, hence removing the initialization bias. The data selection is motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art on this problem. The results demonstrate that graph-based one-shot data selection achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</description>

      <title>Structural and Practical Identifiability of Phenomenological Growth Models for Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phenomenological models are highly effective tools for forecasting disease dynamics using real world data, particularly in scenarios where detailed knowledge of disease mechanisms is limited. However, their reliability depends on the model parameters' structural and practical identifiability. In this study, we systematically analyze the identifiability of six commonly used growth models in epidemiology:the generalized growth model, the generalized logistic model, the Richards model, the generalized Richards model, the Gompertz model, and a modified SEIR model with inhomogeneous mixing. To address challenges posed by non-integer power exponents in these models, we reformulate them by introducing additional state variables. This enables rigorous structural identifiability analysis using the StructuralIdentifiability.jl package in JULIA. We validate the structural identifiability results by performing parameter estimation and forecasting using the GrowthPredict MATLAB toolbox. This toolbox is designed to fit and forecast time series trajectories based on phenomenological growth models. We applied it to three epidemiological datasets: weekly incidence data for monkeypox, COVID 19, and Ebola. Additionally, we assess practical identifiability through Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate parameter estimation robustness under varying levels of observational noise. Our results confirm that all six models are structurally identifiable under the proposed reformulation. Furthermore, practical identifiability analyses demonstrate that parameter estimates remain robust across different noise levels, though sensitivity varies by model and dataset. These findings provide critical insights into the strengths and limitations of phenomenological models to characterize epidemic trajectories, emphasizing their adaptability to real world challenges and their role in informing public health interventions.</description>

      <title>A Progressive Risk Formulation for Enhanced Deep Learning based Total Knee Replacement Prediction in Knee Osteoarthritis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed deep learning models for predicting Total Knee Replacement (TKR) need within various time horizons in knee osteoarthritis patients, with a novel capability: the models can perform TKR prediction using a single scan, and furthermore when a previous scan is available, they leverage a progressive risk formulation to improve their predictions. Unlike conventional approaches that treat each scan of a patient independently, our method incorporates a constraint based on disease's progressive nature, ensuring that predicted TKR risk either increases or remains stable over time when multiple scans of a knee are available. This was achieved by enforcing a progressive risk formulation constraint during training with patients who have more than one available scan in the studies. Knee radiographs and MRIs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) were used in this work and deep learning models were trained to predict TKR within 1, 2, and 4-year time periods. The proposed approach, utilizing a dual-model risk constraint architecture, demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline - conventional models trained with standard binary cross entropy loss. It achieved an AUROC of 0.87 and AUPRC of 0.47 for 1-year TKR prediction on the OAI radiograph test set, considerably improving over the baseline AUROC of 0.79 and AUPRC of 0.34. For the MOST radiograph test set, the proposed approach achieved an AUROC of 0.77 and AUPRC of 0.25 for 1-year predictions, outperforming the baseline AUROC of 0.71 and AUPRC of 0.19. Similar trends were observed in the MRI testsets</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathology image analysis plays a pivotal role in medical diagnosis, with deep learning techniques significantly advancing diagnostic accuracy and research. While numerous studies have been conducted to address specific pathological tasks, the lack of standardization in pre-processing methods and model/database architectures complicates fair comparisons across different approaches. This highlights the need for a unified pipeline and comprehensive benchmarks to enable consistent evaluation and accelerate research progress. In this paper, we present UnPuzzle, a novel and unified framework for pathological AI research that covers a broad range of pathology tasks with benchmark results. From high-level to low-level, upstream to downstream tasks, UnPuzzle offers a modular pipeline that encompasses data pre-processing, model composition,taskconfiguration,andexperimentconduction.Specifically, it facilitates efficient benchmarking for both Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Region of Interest (ROI) tasks. Moreover, the framework supports variouslearningparadigms,includingself-supervisedlearning,multi-task learning,andmulti-modallearning,enablingcomprehensivedevelopment of pathology AI models. Through extensive benchmarking across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of UnPuzzle in streamlining pathology AI research and promoting reproducibility. We envision UnPuzzle as a cornerstone for future advancements in pathology AI, providing a more accessible, transparent, and standardized approach to model evaluation.
