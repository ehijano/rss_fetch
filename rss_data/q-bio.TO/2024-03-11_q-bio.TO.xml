      <title>An in-silico approach to meniscus tissue regeneration: Modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model the dynamics of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and chondrocytes evolving in a nonwoven polyethylene terephtalate (PET) scaffold impregnated with hyaluron and supplied with a differentiation medium. The scaffold and the cells are assumed to be contained in a bioreactor with fluid perfusion. The differentiation of hMSCs into chondrocytes favors the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and is influenced by fluid stress. The model takes deformations of ECM and PET scaffold into account. The scaffold structure is explicitly included by statistical assessment of the fibre distribution from CT images. The effective macroscopic equations are obtained by appropriate upscaling from dynamics on lower (microscopic and mesoscopic) scales and feature in the motility terms an explicit cell diffusion tensor encoding the assessed anisotropic scaffold structure. Numerical simulations show its influence on the overall cell and tissue dynamics.</description>

      <title>Visualizing, Analyzing and Constructing L-System from Arborized 3D Model Using a Web Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biology, arborized structures are well represented and typically complex for visualization and analysis. In order to have a profound understanding of the topology of arborized 3D biological model, higher level abstraction is needed. We aim at constructing an abstraction of arborized 3D biological model to an L-system that provides a generalized formalization in a grammar to represent complex structures. The focus of this paper is to combine 3D visualization, analysis and L-system abstraction into a single web application. We designed a front-end user interface and a back-end. In the front-end, we used A-Frame and defined algorithms to generate and visualize L-systems. In the back-end, we utilized the Vascular Modelling Toolkit's (VMTK) centerline analysis methods to extract important features from the arborized 3D models, which can be applied to L-system generation. In addition, two 3D biological models: lactiferous duct and artery are used as two case studies to verify the functionality of this web application. In conclusion, our web application is able to visualize, analyse and create L-system abstractions of arborized 3D models. This in turn provides workflow-improving benefits, easy accessibility and extensibility.</description>

      <title>Complementing cell taxonomies with a multicellular functional analysis of tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of single-cell molecular profiling coupled with spatial technologies has enabled charting cellular heterogeneity in reference tissues and in disease. This new wave of molecular data has highlighted the expected diversity of single-cell dynamics upon shared external queues and spatial organizations. However, little is known about the relationship between single cell heterogeneity and the emergence and maintenance of robust multicellular processes in developed tissues and its role in (patho)physiology. Here, we present emerging computational modeling strategies that use increasingly available large-scale cross-condition single cell and spatial datasets, to study multicellular organization in tissues and complement cell taxonomies. This perspective should enable us to better understand how cells within tissues collectively process information and adapt synchronized responses in disease contexts and to bridge the gap between structural changes and functions in tissues.</description>

      <title>General surgery vision transformer: A video pre-trained foundation model for general surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of openly accessible data and specialized foundation models is a major barrier for computational research in surgery. Toward this, (i) we open-source the largest dataset of general surgery videos to-date, consisting of 680 hours of surgical videos, including data from robotic and laparoscopic techniques across 28 procedures; (ii) we propose a technique for video pre-training a general surgery vision transformer (GSViT) on surgical videos based on forward video prediction that can run in real-time for surgical applications, toward which we open-source the code and weights of GSViT; (iii) we also release code and weights for procedure-specific fine-tuned versions of GSViT across 10 procedures; (iv) we demonstrate the performance of GSViT on the Cholec80 phase annotation task, displaying improved performance over state-of-the-art single frame predictors.</description>

      <title>Comparing the physical characteristics of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to diagnose ovarian cysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background, For the purpose of determining the appropriate course of therapy to maintain fertility, a correct diagnosis of ovarian cysts is crucial. Objective, To contrast the results of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography in individuals with ovarian cysts .
Methods: research was carried out in the radiology division of Al-Hilla General Teaching hospital and Marjan Teaching Hospital in province Babil in the period of November 2023 and march 2024, Seventy-five Following a physical and ultrasonography examination, the female patient was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Women in the over-18 age group exhibit a range of symptoms, such as irregular menstruation, abdominal pain, sensoria, and menorrhagia.
Results: Adnexal lesions on US imaging included chocolate cysts (14.6%), dermoid cysts (13.8%), hemorrhagic cysts (HC) (11.6%), simple cysts (32.4%), complicated cysts (21.2%), and multilocular cysts (MC) (6.4%).Simple cysts (SC) made up 29%, complex cysts (6.9%), dermoid cysts (10.9%), chocolate cysts (19.1%), hemorrhagic cysts (HC) 11.3%, multilocular cysts (6.8%), and malignant cysts (MC) 16% of the adnexal lesions on MRI. The USG results show 100% sensitivity, 78.3% specificity, and 89.3% accuracy when compared to the MRI results.
 Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging, which is quite accurate in determining the mass's origin and characterizing its tissue content, may be beneficial in further evaluating monographically vague ovarian cysts with solid or complicated content</description>

      <title>Study of the mechanism of electroacupuncture regulating ferroptosis, inhibiting bladder neck fibrosis, and improving bladder urination function after suprasacral spinal cord injury using proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose The aim of this study was to explore whether electroacupuncture regulates phenotypic transformation of smooth muscle cells by inhibiting ferroptosis and inhibiting fibrosis, thereby improving bladder urination function after suprasacral spinal cord injury (SSCI). Methods The experiment was divided into sham, model, and electroacupuncture group. After 10 days of electroacupuncture intervention, urodynamic examination was performed, and bladder neck was taken for HE staining, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis, Western blot(WB) detection, ferrous ion concentration detection and Masson staining. Conclusion Electroacupuncture may prevent the phenotype of bladder neck smooth muscle cells from transforming from contraction type to synthesis type by inhibiting ferroptosis, inhibit bladder neck fibrosis, improve bladder neck compliance, and thus improve bladder urination function after SSCI.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Voronoi Tessellations as Models for Cellular Neighborhoods in Simple Multicellular Organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on distinct multicellular organisms has revealed a hitherto unknown type of biological noise; rather than a regular arrangement, cellular neighborhood volumes, obtained by Voronoi tessellations of the cell locations, are broadly distributed and consistent with gamma distributions. We propose an explanation for those observations in the case of the alga $Volvox$, whose somatic cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) they export. Both a solvable one-dimensional model of ECM growth derived from bursty transcriptional activity and a two-dimensional "Voronoi liquid" model are shown to provide one-parameter families that smoothly interpolate between the empirically-observed near-maximum-entropy gamma distributions and the crystalline limit of Gaussian distributions governed by the central limit theorem. These results highlight a universal consequence of intrinsic biological noise on the architecture of certain tissues.</description>

      <title>A transductive few-shot learning approach for classification of digital histopathological slides from liver cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for classifying 2D histopathology patches using few-shot learning. The method is designed to tackle a significant challenge in histopathology, which is the limited availability of labeled data. By applying a sliding window technique to histopathology slides, we illustrate the practical benefits of transductive learning (i.e., making joint predictions on patches) to achieve consistent and accurate classification. Our approach involves an optimization-based strategy that actively penalizes the prediction of a large number of distinct classes within each window. We conducted experiments on histopathological data to classify tissue classes in digital slides of liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma. The initial results show the effectiveness of our method and its potential to enhance the process of automated cancer diagnosis and treatment, all while reducing the time and effort required for expert annotation.</description>
