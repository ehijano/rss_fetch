      <title>Variations in Line Profiles of Atomic Transitions in RR Lyrae Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the absorption shapes of atomic lines and H{\alpha} in RR Lyrae stars. We used the database of high resolution spectra gathered with the Las Campanas Observatory du Pont Telescope, analyzing a set of about 2700 short exposure spectra of 17 RRab and 5 RRc variables. To increase the signal-to-noise of the spectra for each star, we first co-added spectra in small photometric phase bins, and then co-added metallic line profiles in velocity space. The resulting line absorption shapes vary with photometric phase in a consistent manner for all RRab stars, while exhibiting no obvious phase-related variations for the RRc stars. We interpret these line profile variations in terms of velocity gradients in the photospheric layers that produce absorption line profiles. The H{\alpha} profiles are much broader, indicative of shock temperatures of order 100,000 K.</description>

      <title>First determination of the angular dependence of rise and decay times of solar radio bursts using multi-spacecraft observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio photons interact with anisotropic density fluctuations in the heliosphere, which can alter their trajectory and influence properties deduced from observations. This is particularly evident in solar radio observations, where anisotropic scattering leads to highly-directional radio emissions. Consequently, observers at varying locations will measure different properties, including different source sizes, source positions, and intensities. However, it is not known if measurements of the decay time of solar radio bursts are also affected by the observer's position. Decay times are dominated by scattering effects, and so are frequently used as proxies of the level of density fluctuations in the heliosphere, making the identification of any location-related dependence crucial. We combine multi-vantage observations of interplanetary Type III bursts from four non-collinear, angularly-separated spacecraft with simulations, to investigate the dependence of both the decay- and rise-time measurements on the separation of the observer from the source. We propose a function to characterise the entire time profile of radio signals, allowing for the simultaneous estimation of the peak flux, decay time, and rise time, while demonstrating that the rise phase of radio bursts has a non-constant, non-exponential growth rate. We determine that the decay and rise times are independent of the observer's position, identifying them as the only properties to remain unaffected, thus not requiring corrections for the observer's location. Moreover, we examine the ratio between the rise and decay times, finding that it does not depend on the frequency. Therefore, we provide the first evidence that the rise phase is also significantly impacted by scattering effects, adding to our understanding of the plasma emission process.</description>

      <title>Molecular line polarisation from the circumstellar envelopes of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarisation observations of masers in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) around Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars have revealed strong magnetic fields. However, masers probe only specific lines-of-sight through the CSE. Non-masing molecular line polarisation observation can more directly reveal the large scale magnetic field morphology and hence probe the effect of the magnetic field on AGB mass-loss and the shaping of the AGB wind. Observations and models of CSE molecular line polarisation can now be used to describe the magnetic field morphology and estimate its strength throughout the entire CSE. We use observations taken with ALMA of molecular line polarisation in the envelope of two AGB stars (CW~Leo and R~Leo). We model the observations using the multi-dimensional polarised radiative transfer tool PORTAL. We find linearly polarised emission, with maximum fractional polarisation on the order of a few percent, in several molecular lines towards both stars.
  We can explain the observed differences in polarisation structure between the different molecular lines by alignment of the molecules by a combination of the Goldreich-Kylafis effect and radiative alignment effects. We specifically show that the polarisation of CO traces the morphology of the magnetic field. Competition between the alignment mechanisms allows us to describe the behaviour of the magnetic field strength with radius throughout the circumstellar envelope of CW~Leo. The magnetic field strength derived using this method is inconsistent with the magnetic field strength derived using a structure function analysis of the CO polarisation and the strength previously derived using CN Zeeman observations. In contrast with CW~Leo, the magnetic field in the outer envelope of R~Leo appears to be advected outwards by the stellar wind. {abridged abstract}</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters II: Difficulty of Gaia NS formation in low-mass star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called ``Gaia BHs'' and ``Gaia NSs'', respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $2$ and $\sim 20$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>

      <title>The orbital parameters of the del Cep inner binary system determined using 2019 HARPS-N spectroscopic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inner companion has recently been discovered orbiting the prototype of classical Cepheids, delta Cep, whose orbital parameters are still not fully constrained. We collected new precise radial velocity measurements of delta Cep in 2019 using the HARPS-N spectrograph mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Using these radial velocity measurements, we aimed to improve the orbital parameters of the system. We considered a template available in the literature as a reference for the radial velocity curve of the pulsation of the star. We then calculated the residuals between our global dataset (composed of the new 2019 observations plus data from the literature) and the template as a function of the pulsation phase and the barycentric Julian date. This provides the orbital velocity of the Cepheid component. Using a Bayesian tool, we derived the orbital parameters of the system. Considering priors based on already published Gaia constraints, we find for the orbital period a maximum a posteriori probability of Porb=9.32+/-0.03 years (uncertainties correspond to the 95% highest density probability interval), and we obtain an eccentricity e=0.71+/-0.02, a semimajor axis a=0.029 +/-0.003 arcsecond, and a center-of-mass velocity V0=-17.28+/-0.08 km/s, among other parameters. In this short analysis we derive the orbital parameters of the delta Cep inner binary system and provide a cleaned radial velocity curve of the pulsation of the star, which will be used to study its Baade-Wesselink projection factor in a future publication.</description>

      <title>On the surface helium abundance of B-type hot subdwarf stars from the WD+MS channel of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of intermediate helium (He)-rich hot subdwarfs are still unclear. Previous studies have suggested that some surviving Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) companions from the white dwarf~+~main-sequence (WD+MS) channel may contribute to the intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. However, previous studies ignored the impact of atomic diffusion on the post-explosion evolution of surviving companion stars of SNe Ia, leading to that they could not explain the observed surface He abundance of intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. In this work, by taking the atomic diffusion and stellar wind into account, we trace the surviving companions of SNe Ia from the WD+MS channel using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code \textsc{MESA} until they evolve into hot subdwarfs. We find that the surface He-abundances of our surviving companion models during their core He-burning phases are in a range of $-1 \lesssim {\rm log}(N_{\rm He}/N_{\rm H}) \lesssim 0$, which are consistent with those observed in intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. This seems to further support that surviving companions of SNe Ia in the WD+MS channel are possible to form some intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs.</description>

      <title>First Light Curve Analysis of NSVS 8294044, V1023 Her, and V1397 Her Contact Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first photometric light curve investigation of the NSVS 8294044, V1023 Her, and V1397 Her binary systems is presented. We used ground-based observations for the NSVS 8294044 system and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data for V1023 Her and V1397 Her. The primary and secondary times of minima were extracted from all the data, and by collecting the literature, a new ephemeris was computed for each system. Linear fits for the O-C diagrams were conducted using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Light curve solutions were performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the MCMC approach. The systems were found to be contact binary stars based on the fillout factor and mass ratio. V1023 Her showed the O'Connell effect, and a cold starspot on the secondary component was required for the light curve solution. The absolute parameters of the system were estimated based on an empirical relationship between orbital period and mass. We presented a new T-M equation based on a sample of 428 contact binary systems and found that our three target systems were in good agreement with the fit. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the M-L, M-R, q-L_{ratio}, and M_{tot}-J_0 diagrams in the logarithmic scales.</description>

      <title>Gaia23bab : a new EXor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On March 6 2023, the Gaia telescope has alerted a 2-magnitude burst from Gaia23bab, a Young Stellar Object in the Galactic plane. We observed Gaia23bab with the Large Binocular Telescope obtaining optical and near-infrared spectra close in time to the peak of the burst, and collected all public multi-band photometry to reconstruct the historical light curve. This latter shows three bursts in ten years (2013, 2017 and 2023), whose duration and amplitude are typical of EXor variables.
  We estimate that, due to the bursts, the mass accumulated on the star is about twice greater than if the source had remained quiescent for the same period of time. Photometric analysis indicates that Gaia23bab is a Class,II source with age &lt; 1 Myr, spectral type G3-K0, stellar luminosity 4.0 L_sun, and mass 1.6 M_sun. The optical/near infrared spectrum is rich in emission lines. From the analysis of these lines we measured the accretion luminosity and the mass accretion rate L_acc(burst)=3.7 L_sun, M_acc(burst) 2.0 10 $^(-7) M_sun/yr, consistent with those of EXors. More generally, we derive the relationships between accretion and stellar parameters in a sample of EXors. We find that, when in burst, the accretion parameters become almost independent of the stellar parameters and that EXors, even in quiescence, are more efficient than classical T Tauri stars in assembling mass.</description>

      <title>CME Deflection and East-West Asymmetry of ESP Intensity in Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the East-West asymmetry in energetic storm particle (ESP) heavy ion intensities at interplanetary shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. We use observations from NASA's ACE and STEREO missions of helium (He), oxygen (O), and iron (Fe) intensities from ~0.13 to 3 MeV/nucleon. We examine the longitudinal distribution of ESP intensities and the correlation of ESP intensities with the near-Sun CME speed and the average transit CME speed for eastern and western events. We observed an East-West asymmetry reversal of ESP heavy ion intensities from SC 23 to 24. We have determined that this change in asymmetry is caused by a shift in the heliolongitude distribution of the CME speed ratio (the ratio of CME near-Sun speed to CME average transit speed) from west to east.</description>

      <title>Combining magneto-hydrostatic constraints with Stokes profile inversions. IV. Imposing $\nabla\cdot{\bf B}=0$ condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferences of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere by means of spectropolarimetric inversions (i.e., Stokes inversion codes) yield magnetic fields that are non-solenoidal($\nabla\cdot{\bf B} \ne 0$). Because of this, results obtained by such methods are sometimes put into question. We aim to develop and implement a new technique that can retrieve magnetic fields that are simultaneously consistent with observed polarization signals and with the null divergence condition. The method used in this work strictly imposes $\nabla\cdot{\bf B}=0$ by determining the vertical component of the magnetic field ($B_{\rm z}$) from the horizontal ones ($B_{\rm x},B_{\rm y}$). We implement this solenoidal inversion into the FIRTEZ Stokes inversion code and apply it to spectropolarimetric observations of a sunspot observed with the Hinode/SP instrument. We show that the solenoidal inversion retrieves a vertical component of the magnetic field that is consistent with the vertical component of the magnetic field inferred from the non-solenoidal one. We demonstrate that the solenoidal inversion is capable of a better overall fitting to the observed Stokes vector than the non-solenoidal inversion. In fact, the solenoidal magnetic field fits Stokes $V$ worse, but this is compensated by a better fit to Stokes $I$. We find a direct correlation between the worsening in the fit to the circular polarization profiles by the solenoidal inversion and the deviations in the inferred $B_{\rm z}$ with respect to the non-solenoidal inversion. These results support the idea that common Stokes inversion techniques fail to reproduce $\nabla\cdot{\bf B}=0$ mainly as a consequence of the uncertainties in the determination of the individual components of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Polarized Solar Corona during the Annular Eclipse of October 14, 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a dual eclipse expedition to observe the solar corona from two sites during the annular solar eclipse of 2023 October 14, using a novel coronagraph designed to be accessible for amateurs and students to build and deploy. The coronagraph "CATEcor" builds on the standardized eclipse observing equipment developed for the Citizen CATE 2024 experiment. The observing sites were selected for likelihood of clear observations, for historic relevance (near the Climax site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains), and for centrality to the annular eclipse path (atop Sandia Peak above Albuquerque, New Mexico). The novel portion of CATEcor is an external occulter assembly that slips over the front of a conventional dioptric telescope, forming a "shaded-truss" externally occulted coronagraph. CATEcor is specifically designed to be easily constructed in a garage or "makerspace" environment. We successfully observed some bright features in the solar corona to an altitude of approximately 2.25 R$_\odot$ during the annular phases of the eclipse. Future improvements to the design, in progress now, will reduce both stray light and image artifacts; our objective is to develop a design that can be operated successfully by amateur astronomers at sufficient altitude even without the darkened skies of a partial or annular eclipse.</description>

      <title>An Informed and Systematic Method to Identify Variable mid-L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most brown dwarfs show some level of photometric or spectral variability. However, finding the most variable dwarfs more suited for a thorough variability monitoring campaign remained a challenge until a few years ago with the design of spectral indices to find the most likely L and T dwarfs using their near-infrared single-epoch spectrum. In this work, we designed and tested near-infrared spectral indices to pre-select the most likely variable L4-L8 dwarfs, complementing the indices presented by Ashraf et al. (2022) and Oliveros-Gomez et al. (2022). We used time-resolved near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectra of an L6.0 dwarf, LP 261-75b, to design our novel spectral indices. We tested these spectral indices on 75 L4.0-L8.0 near-infrared SpeX/IRTF spectra, providing 27 new variable candidates. Our indices have a recovery rate of 80 percent and a false negative rate of 25 percent. All the known non-variable brown dwarfs were found to be non-variable by our indices. We estimated the variability fraction of our sample to be near 51 percent, which agrees with the variability fractions provided by Buenzli et al. (2014), Radigan et al. (2014), and Metchev et al. (2015) for L4-L8 dwarfs. These spectral indices may support in the future, the selection of the most likely variable directly-imaged exoplanets for studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and as well as the 30-m telescopes.</description>

Abstract: Draco dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is one of the nearest and the most dark matter dominated satellites of the Milky Way. We obtained multi-epoch near-infrared (NIR, $JHK_s$) observations of the central region of Draco dSph covering a sky area of $\sim 21'\times21'$ using the WIRCam instrument at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Homogeneous $JHK_s$ time-series photometry for 212 RR Lyrae (173 fundamental-mode, 24 first-overtone, and 15 mixed-mode variables) and 5 Anomalous Cepheids in Draco dSph is presented and used to derive their period-luminosity relations at NIR wavelengths for the first-time. The small scatter of $\sim 0.05$~mag in these empirical relations for RR Lyrae stars is consistent with those in globular clusters and suggests a very small metallicity spread, up to $\sim0.2$~dex, among these centrally located variables. Based on empirically calibrated NIR period-luminosity-metallicity relations for RR Lyrae in globular clusters, we determined a distance modulus to Draco dSph of $\mu_\textrm{RRL} = 19.557 \pm 0.026$ mag. The calibrated $K_s$-band period-luminosity relations for Anomalous Cepheids in the Draco dSph and the Large Magellanic Cloud exhibit statistically consistent slopes but systematically different zero-points, hinting at possible metallicity dependence of $\sim-0.3$ mag~dex$^{-1}$. Finally, the apparent magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch in $I$ and $J$ bands also agree well with their absolute calibrations with the adopted RR Lyrae distance to Draco. Our recommended $\sim1.5\%$ precise RR Lyrae distance, $D_\textrm{Draco} = 81.55 \pm 0.98 \textrm{(statistical)} \pm 1.17 \textrm{(systematic)}$~kpc, is the most accurate and precise distance to Draco dSph galaxy.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physics of Star-Formation (ProPStar): II. The first systematic search for streamers toward protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of narrow channels of accretion toward protostellar disks, known as streamers, have increased in number in the last few years. However, it is unclear if streamers are a common feature around protostars that were previously missed, or if they are a rare phenomenon. Our goals are to obtain the incidence of streamers toward a region of clustered star formation and to trace the origins of their gas, to determine if they originate within the filamentary structure of molecular clouds or from beyond. We used combined observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region, carried out with the NOEMA interferometer and the IRAM 30m single dish. Our observations cover the area between the IRAS 4 and SVS 13 systems. We traced the chemically fresh gas within NGC 1333 with HC3N molecular gas emission and the structure of the fibers in this region with N2H+ emission. We fit multiple velocity components in both maps and used clustering algorithms to recover velocity-coherent structures. We find streamer candidates toward 7 out of 16 young stellar objects within our field of view. This represents an incidence of approximately 40\% of young stellar objects with streamer candidates when looking at a clustered star forming region. The incidence increases to about 60\% when we considered only embedded protostars. All streamers are found in HC3N emission. Given the different velocities between HC3N and N2H+ emission, and the fact that, by construction, N2H+ traces the fiber structure, we suggest that the gas that forms the streamers comes from outside the fibers. This implies that streamers can connect cloud material that falls to the filaments with protostellar disk scales.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive High-resolution Chemical Spectroscopy of Barnard's Star with SPIRou</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination of fundamental parameters of stars impacts all fields of astrophysics, from galaxy evolution to constraining the internal structure of exoplanets. This paper presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Barnard's star that compares an exceptionally high-quality (an average signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$1000 in the entire domain), high-resolution NIR spectrum taken with CFHT/SPIRou to PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. The observed spectrum shows thousands of lines not identified in the models with a similar large number of lines present in the model but not in the observed data. We also identify several other caveats such as continuum mismatch, unresolved contamination and spectral lines significantly shifted from their expected wavelengths, all of these can be a source of bias for abundance determination. Out of $&gt;10^4$ observed lines in the NIR that could be used for chemical spectroscopy, we identify a short list of a few hundred lines that are reliable. We present a novel method for determining the effective temperature and overall metallicity of slowly-rotating M dwarfs that uses several groups of lines as opposed to bulk spectral fitting methods. With this method, we infer $T_{eff}$ = 3231 $\pm$ 21 K for Barnard's star, consistent with the value of 3238 $\pm$ 11 K inferred from the interferometric method. We also provide abundance measurements of 15 different elements for Barnard's star, including the abundances of four elements (K, O, Y, Th) never reported before for this star. This work emphasizes the need to improve current atmosphere models to fully exploit the NIR domain for chemical spectroscopy analysis.</description>

      <title>A New Mechanism For Generating Type-III Radiation From The Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because the conventional method of creating type-III radiation by coalescence of counter-propagating Langmuir waves has not been verified with in-situ data, Parker Solar Probe data was examined in search of such in-situ evidence, which was not found. Instead, a new mechanism for creating type-III radiation has been found as a result of observing slow Langmuir waves (~2200 km/sec) with electric fields as large as 300 mV/m and associated density fluctuations during a developing type-III burst on March 21, 2023. Because of their slow phase velocities, these Langmuir waves had short wavelengths, several times the Debye length of 2.65 meters, and, as a result, k{\lambda}d~0.93. Such waves may be strongly damped to be replaced by new growing bursts of waves that create the characteristic Langmuir waveform that is composed of peaks and valleys of a few milliseconds duration. The average electron current associated with these Langmuir waves is estimated from the strahl as 8 microamps/m2. Peak currents were at least twice these averages. These Langmuir waves produced electrostatic harmonics having slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 2pi*125 kHz is the Langmuir wave frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. They also produced density fluctuations at the lowest harmonics. Such waves are not the type-III emission. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>

      <title>Evidence for 3XMM J185246.6+003317 as a massive magnetar with a low magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3XMM J185246.6+003317 is a transient magnetar located in the vicinity of the supernova remnant Kes\,79. So far, observations have only set upper limits to its surface magnetic field and spindown, and there is no estimate for its mass and radius. Using ray-tracing modelling and Bayesian inference for the analysis of several light curves spanning a period of around three weeks, we have found that it may be one of the most massive neutron stars to date. In addition, our analysis suggests a multipolar magnetic field structure with a subcritical field strength and a carbon atmosphere composition. Due to the time-resolution limitation of the available light curves, we estimate the surface magnetic field and the mass to be $\log_{10} (B/{\rm G}) = 11.89^{+0.19}_{-0.93}$ and $M=2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$~$M_{\odot}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the radius is estimated to be $R=12.02^{+1.44}_{-1.42}$ km at $2\sigma$ confidence level. They were verified by simulations, i.e., data injections with known model parameters, and their subsequent recovery. The best-fitting model has three small hot spots, two of them in the southern hemisphere. These are, however, just first estimates and conclusions, based on a simple ray-tracing model with anisotropic emission; we also estimate the impact of modelling on the parameter uncertainties and the relevant phenomena on which to focus in more precise analyses. We interpret the above best-fitting results as due to accretion of supernova layers/interstellar medium onto 3XMM J185246.6+003317 leading to burying and a subsequent re-emergence of the magnetic field, and a carbon atmosphere being formed possibly due to hydrogen/helium diffusive nuclear burning. Finally, we briefly discuss some consequences of our findings for superdense matter constraints.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino natal kicks from black-hole binary VFTS 243</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently reported observation of VFTS 243 is the first example of a massive black-hole binary system with negligible binary interaction following black-hole formation. The black-hole mass ($\approx 10\ M_{\odot}$) and near-circular orbit ($e\approx 0.02$) of VFTS 243 suggest that the progenitor star experienced complete collapse, with energy-momentum being lost predominantly through neutrinos. VFTS 243 enables us to constrain the natal kick and neutrino-emission asymmetry during black-hole formation. At 68% C.L., the natal kick velocity (mass decrement) is $\lesssim 10$ km/s ($\lesssim 1.0\ M_{\odot}$), with a full probability distribution that peaks when $\approx 0.3\ M_{\odot}$ were ejected, presumably in neutrinos, and the black hole experienced a natal kick of $4$ km/s. The neutrino-emission asymmetry is $\lesssim 4$%, with best fit values of $\sim$0-0.2%. Such a small neutrino natal kick accompanying black-hole formation is in agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A gamma ray study of Galactic PeVatron candidates LHAASO J1825-1236 and J1839-0545</title>

Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from these surrounding pulsars. We simulated particle propagation throughout the Galaxy using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. Furthermore, we used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. The findings suggest that CTA may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neonlike Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity-equivalent +/- ~5 km/s in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a ten-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

      <title>Populating The Milky Way: Characterising Planet Demographics by Combining Galaxy Formation Simulations and Planet Population Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar populations and their distribution differ widely across the Galaxy, which is likely to affect planet demographics. Our local neighbourhood is dominated by young, metal-rich stars in the galactic thin disc, while the stellar halo and galactic bulge host a large fraction of older, metal-poor stars. We study the impact of these variations on planet populations in different regions of the Galaxy by combining a high-resolution galaxy formation simulation with state-of-the-art planet population synthesis models.
  We construct a population model to estimate occurrence rates of different planet types, based on the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis by Emsenhuber et al., 2021. We apply this to a simulated Milky Way--Analogue in the HESTIA galaxy formation simulation. We study the planet occurrence rate in the metal-rich regions of the inner Galaxy, i.e. in the galactic bulge and thin disc, and contrast them to the frequencies in the more distant, metal-poor region like the thick disc and stellar halo.
  We find that the planet demographics in the metal-poor regions of the Milky Way-Analogue, differ strongly from the planet populations in the more distant, metal-poor regions. The occurrence rate of giant planets ($&gt;300 M_\bigoplus$) is 10 to 20 times larger in the thin disc compared to the thick disc, driven by the low amounts of solid material available for planet formation around metal-poor stars. Similarly, low-mass Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars are most abundant in the thick disc, being 1.5 times more frequent than in the thin disc. Moreover, low-mass planets are expected to be abundant throughout the galaxy, from the central regions to the outer halo, due to their formation processes being less dependent on stellar metallicity. The planet populations differ more strongly around Sun-like stars compared to dwarfs with masses 0.3 - 0.5 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>FAUST XIII. Dusty cavity and molecular shock driven by IRS7B in the Corona Australis cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the chemical diversity observed around low-mass protostars probably resides in the earliest history of these systems. We aim to investigate the impact of protostellar feedback on the chemistry and grain growth in the circumstellar medium of multiple stellar systems. In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present high-resolution (50 au) observations of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and SiO and continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm towards the Corona Australis star cluster. Methanol emission reveals an arc-like structure at $\sim$1800 au from the protostellar system IRS7B along the direction perpendicular to the major axis of the disc. The arc is located at the edge of two elongated continuum structures that define a cone emerging from IRS7B. The region inside the cone is probed by H$_2$CO, while the eastern wall of the arc shows bright emission in SiO, a typical shock tracer. Taking into account the association with a previously detected radio jet imaged with JVLA at 6 cm, the molecular arc reveals for the first time a bow shock driven by IRS7B and a two-sided dust cavity opened by the mass-loss process. For each cavity wall, we derive an average H$_2$ column density of $\sim$7$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a mass of $\sim$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$, and a lower limit on the dust spectral index of $1.4$. These observations provide the first evidence of a shock and a conical dust cavity opened by the jet driven by IRS7B, with important implications for the chemical enrichment and grain growth in the envelope of Solar System analogues.</description>
