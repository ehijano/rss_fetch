      <title>Short geodesics and multiplicities of eigenvalues of hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain upper bounds on the multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues for closed hyperbolic surfaces in terms of the number of short closed geodesics and the genus $g$. For example, we show that if the number of short closed geodesics is sublinear in $g$, then the multiplicity of the first eigenvalue is also sublinear in $g$. This makes new progress on a conjecture by Colin de Verdi\`ere in the mid 1980s.</description>

      <title>Mode stability for self-similar blowup of slightly supercritical NLS: I. low-energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider self-similar blowup for (NLS) $i\partial_t u + \Delta u + u|u|^{p-1} = 0$ in $d \ge 1$ and slightly mass-supercritical range $0 &lt; s_c := \frac d2 - \frac{2}{p-1} \ll 1$. The existence and stability of such dynamics [Merle-Rapha\"el-Szeftel, 2010] and construction of suitable profiles [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] lead to the question of asymptotic stability. Based on our previous work [Li, 2023], this nonlinear problem is reduced to linear mode stability of the matrix linearized operator. In this work, we prove mode stability for the low-energy spectrum in $d \ge 1$ as a perturbation of the linearized operator around ground state for mass-critical NLS. The main difficulty of this spectral bifurcation problem arises from the non-self-adjoint, relatively unbounded and high-dimensional nature, for which we exploit the Jost function argument from [Perelman, 2001], qualitative WKB analysis generalized from [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021], matched asymptotics method and uniform estimates for high spherical classes based on special functions.</description>

      <title>Mode stability for self-similar blowup of slightly supercritical NLS: II. high-energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continuation of the study of the companion work, we prove the high-energy mode stability for linearized operator around self-similar profiles in [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] for slightly mass-supercritical NLS in $1 \le d \le 10$. This concludes the asymptotic stability of such self-similar blowup, and answers the question from [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] and [Merle-Rapha\"el-Szeftel, 2010]. As a byproduct, we characterize the spectrum for linearized operator around mass-critical ground state for $1 \le d \le 10$, which could be useful for future studies of asymptotic behavior near ground state. The core idea is a linear Liouville argument, originated by Martel-Merle [Martel-Merle, 2000, 2001] studying soliton stability, to reformulate the eigen problem as rigidity of linear dynamics so as to introduce modulation and to apply nonlinear dynamical controls. Our controlling quantities were verified with numerical help in [Merle-Rapha\"el, 2005; Fibich-Merle-Rapha\"el, 2006; Yang-Roudenko-Zhao, 2018] for $1 \le d \le 10$.</description>

      <title>The graph $\infty$-Laplacian eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze various formulations of the $\infty$-Laplacian eigenvalue problem on graphs, comparing their properties and highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. First, we investigate the graph $\infty$-eigenpairs arising as limits of $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs, extending key results from the continuous setting to the discrete domain. We prove that every limit of $p$-Laplacian eigenpair, for $p$ going to $\infty$, satisfies a limit eigenvalue equation and establish that the corresponding eigenvalue can be bounded from below by the packing radius of the graph, indexed by the number of nodal domains induced by the eigenfunction. Additionally, we show that the limits, for $p$ going to $\infty$, of the variational $p$-Laplacian eigenvalues are bounded both from above and from below by the packing radii, achieving equality for the smallest two variational eigenvalues and corresponding packing radii of the graph. In the second part of the paper, we introduce generalized $\infty$-Laplacian eigenpairs as generalized critical points and values of the $\infty$-Rayleigh quotient. We prove that the generalized variational $\infty$-eigenvalues equal the limit of the $p$-Laplacian variational eigenvalues and so satisfy the same upper bounds in terms of packing radii. Finally, we establish that any solution to the limit eigenvalue equation is also a generalized eigenpair, while any generalized eigenpair satisfies the limit eigenvalue equation on a suitable subgraph.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum Zero Problem of nonlinear Dirac equation with particle-antiparticle interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Spectrum Zero Problem of nonlinear Dirac equations with a focus on the behavior of zero at the boundaries of the spectral gap. We introduce a nonlinear particle-antiparticle interaction and demonstrate that the problem exhibits asymmetric behavior at the left and right boundaries of the spectrum. Specifically, when zero is at the right boundary, the problem has only trivial solutions and is identified as a bifurcation point on the left, whereas nontrivial solutions exist when zero is at the left boundary or within the spectral gap. The main idea is to employ a variational method involving a perturbation technique that places zero within the spectral gap. We use the critical point theorem of the perturbed functional to construct a Palais-Smale sequence in order to approach the critical point of the target energy functional. Additionally, we utilize the concentration-compactness principle to identify critical points of the original functional and explore the associated bifurcation phenomena. Our results reveal an asymmetric phenomenon in nonlinear quantum systems and provide insights into why strongly indefinite problems typically address zero only at the left boundary of the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Entropy and determinants for unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several notions of entropy have been studied widely in the ergodic theory of probability-preserving actions of countable groups. These include the generalization of Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy to amenable groups based on F{\o}lner sequences, percolative entropy for general countable groups, and Bowen's sofic entropy for sofic groups. In this work we pursue these notions across an analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. Our main results show that these new quantities can often be evaluated as Fuglede--Kadison determinants. The resulting determinantal formulas offer various non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorem for Toeplitz determinants. They make contact with Arveson's theory of subdiagonal subalgebras, and also with some exact entropy calculations in the ergodic theory of actions by automorphisms of compact Abelian groups.</description>
