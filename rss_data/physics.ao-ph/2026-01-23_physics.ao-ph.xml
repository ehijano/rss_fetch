      <title>Toward Trustworthy Short-Range Forecasts with AFNO: From Skill Metrics to Conservation Checks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data driven weather models now approach traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) skill at short to medium lead times, but their dynamical consistency during autoregressive rollout remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>

      <title>The Iris Illusion in the Tropical Sky Seen Through Two Decades of Aura MLS Ice Water Contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I analyzed ice water content (IWC) data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and sea surface temperature (SST) data from NOAA's Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) product from 2004 to 2024. Using these data, I derived monthly infrared (IR) leakage over the tropics and computed derivatives of both the IR leakage and tropical SST time series from 2005 to 2023. These two derivatives produced a Pearson correlation of -0.49, indicating that IR leakage decreases when SST increases. This behavior contradicts the trend predicted by the Iris hypothesis, suggesting that tropical cirrus clouds strengthen, rather than weaken, as the ocean warms.</description>
