      <title>Sparse identification of evolution equations via Bayesian model selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative formulation of evolution equations is the backbone for prediction, control, and understanding of dynamical systems across diverse scientific fields. Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction limits of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the -- hidden -- interaction structure of a system from empirical observations such as time series. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. To this end, we adopt an information-theoretical point of view and define the reconstructability -- the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. The reconstructability depends on the true data generating model which is shown to set the reconstruction limit, i.e., the performance upper bound for all algorithms. We show that the reconstructability is related to various performance measures, such as the probability of error and the Jaccard similarity. In an empirical context where the true data generating model is unknown, we introduce the reconstruction index as an approximation of the reconstructability. We find that performing model selection is crucial for the validity of the reconstruction index as a proxy of the reconstructability, and illustrate how it assesses the reconstruction limit of empirical time series and networks.</description>

      <title>Photometry of outer Solar System objects from the Dark Energy Survey II: a joint analysis of trans-Neptunian absolute magnitudes, colors, lightcurves and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the 696 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with absolute magnitudes $5.5 &lt; H_r &lt; 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely $H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity. We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright'' (NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$ and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>Robust resonant anomaly detection with NPLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the application of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) algorithm as an alternative to the standard CWoLa method with Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs), particularly for scenarios with rare signal events. NPLM offers an end-to-end approach to anomaly detection and hypothesis testing by utilizing an in-sample evaluation of a binary classifier to estimate a log-density ratio, which can improve detection performance without prior assumptions on the signal model. We examine two approaches: (1) a end-to-end NPLM application in cases with reliable background modelling and (2) an NPLM-based classifier used for signal selection when accurate background modelling is unavailable, with subsequent performance enhancement through a hyper-test on multiple values of the selection threshold. Our findings show that NPLM-based methods outperform BDT-based approaches in detection performance, particularly in low signal injection scenarios, while significantly reducing epistemic variance due to hyperparameter choices. This work highlights the potential of NPLM for robust resonant anomaly detection in particle physics, setting a foundation for future methods that enhance sensitivity and consistency under signal variability.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>The distribution of violent events and interevent times in conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violent conflicts are interrupted by intervals without violence. Interevent times are said have a power law distribution, but this is only true for coarse grained data, typically with a maximal resolution of a single day. For fine grained data, with a resolution of seconds or shorter, the distribution is lognormal. By representing conflicts as a multiplicative process, it becomes clear why these two different distributions are found.</description>
