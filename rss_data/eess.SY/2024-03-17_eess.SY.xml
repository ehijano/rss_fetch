      <title>Reliability and Preventive Maintenance of Ducted Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a reliability life analysis and preventive maintenance schedule for ducted wind turbines. Ducted wind turbines (DWT) are an emerging segment of the renewable energy industry with innovations that promise reliable, efficient, low-cost energy for consumer and small business markets. Many attempts have been made to build viable ducted turbines over the last century, but until recently none have succeeded commercially. Optimal shroud and blade designs are the focus of most engineering research to improve performance and efficiency, however, we hypothesize that an equally important key to the long-term success of small wind innovations is reliability analysis. For consumers and companies who want to efficiently maximize the lifespan of DWTs, this has significant ramifications. Operating beyond service life can result in catastrophic component failure and high replacement costs, making the technology economically infeasible. Our approach is focused on the analysis of 3.5 kW D3 turbines manufactured by Ducted Wind Turbines, Inc. We develop a component-level reliability analysis using ASTM E3159 and a consumer-level preventative maintenance schedule including failure modes and life estimates. Future research can use these findings to guide options for DWT life extension as well as localized maintenance solutions meant to reduce operational costs while preserving energy output.</description>

      <title>Impact of Objective Function on Spectral Efficiency in Integrated HAPS-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), in particular high altitude platform stations (HAPS), with terrestrial networks, referred to as vHetNets, emerges as a promising future wireless network architecture for providing ubiquitous connectivity. In this context, optimizing the performance of vHetNets has become a paramount concern, particularly in harmonized spectrum vHetNets, where HAPS and terrestrial networks share the same frequency band, resulting in severe inter-/intra-tier interference. This paper provides a comparative analysis of different objective functions, specifically focusing on weighted sum rate (WSR), network-wide proportional fairness (NW-PF), and network-wide max-min fairness (NW-MMF), with an aim to design a joint user association scheme and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming weights in a vHetNet, operating in an urban area. The simulation results comprehensively compare the behavior of different objective functions in vHetNets and standalone terrestrial networks. This analysis aims to shed light on the impact of diverse objective functions on the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) of vHetNets.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control for Autonomous Systems: Control Barrier Functions via Reduced-Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern autonomous systems, such as flying, legged, and wheeled robots, are generally characterized by high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, which presents challenges for model-based safety-critical control design. Motivated by the success of reduced-order models in robotics, this paper presents a tutorial on constructive safety-critical control via reduced-order models and control barrier functions (CBFs). To this end, we provide a unified formulation of techniques in the literature that share a common foundation of constructing CBFs for complex systems from CBFs for much simpler systems. Such ideas are illustrated through formal results, simple numerical examples, and case studies of real-world systems to which these techniques have been experimentally applied.</description>

      <title>Wildfire Resilient Unit Commitment under Uncertain Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) are a common pre-emptive measure to reduce wildfire risk due to power system equipment. System operators use PSPS to de-energize electric grid elements that are either prone to failure or located in regions at a high risk of experiencing a wildfire. Successful power system operation during PSPS involves coordination across different time scales. Adjustments to generator commitments and transmission line de-energizations occur at day-ahead intervals while adjustments to load servicing occur at hourly intervals. Generator commitments and operational decisions have to be made under uncertainty in electric grid demand and wildfire potential forecasts. This paper presents deterministic and two-stage mean-CVaR stochastic frameworks to show how the likelihood of large wildfires near transmission lines affects generator commitment and transmission line de-energization strategies. The optimal costs of commitment, operation, and lost load on the IEEE 14-bus test system are compared to the costs generated from prior optimal power shut-off (OPS) formulations. The proposed mean-CVaR stochastic program generates less total expected costs evaluated with respect to higher demand scenarios than costs generated by risk-neutral and deterministic methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sequencing and Motion Control in a Roundabout with Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a controller for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) traversing a single-lane roundabout. The controller simultaneously determines the optimal sequence and associated optimal motion control jointly minimizing travel time and energy consumption while providing speed-dependent safety guarantees, as well as satisfying velocity and acceleration constraints. This is achieved by integrating (a) Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enable receding horizon optimization with (b) Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (CLBFs) to guarantee convergence to a safe set in finite time, thus providing an extended stability region compared to the use of classic Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). The proposed MPC-CLBF framework addresses both infeasibility and myopic control issues commonly encountered when controlling CAVs over multiple interconnected control zones in a traffic network, which has been a limitation of prior work on CAVs going through roundabouts, while still providing safety guarantees. Simulations under varying traffic demands demonstrate the controller's effectiveness and stability.</description>

      <title>Compositionally Verifiable Vector Neural Lyapunov Functions for Stability Analysis of Interconnected Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there has been increasing interest in using neural networks to compute Lyapunov functions, verifying that these functions satisfy the Lyapunov conditions and certifying stability regions remain challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we demonstrate that by leveraging the compositional structure of interconnected nonlinear systems, it is possible to verify neural Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional systems beyond the capabilities of current satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers using a monolithic approach. Our numerical examples employ neural Lyapunov functions trained by solving Zubov's partial differential equation (PDE), which characterizes the domain of attraction for individual subsystems. These examples show a performance advantage over sums-of-squares (SOS) polynomial Lyapunov functions derived from semidefinite programming.</description>

      <title>LyZNet: A Lightweight Python Tool for Learning and Verifying Neural Lyapunov Functions and Regions of Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a lightweight Python framework that provides integrated learning and verification of neural Lyapunov functions for stability analysis. The proposed tool, named LyZNet, learns neural Lyapunov functions using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Zubov's equation and verifies them using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. What distinguishes this tool from others in the literature is its ability to provide verified regions of attraction close to the domain of attraction. This is achieved by encoding Zubov's partial differential equation (PDE) into the PINN approach. By embracing the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problems, we demonstrate that in cases where convex optimization, such as semidefinite programming, fails to capture the domain of attraction, our neural network framework proves more successful. The tool also offers automatic decomposition of coupled nonlinear systems into a network of low-dimensional subsystems for compositional verification. We illustrate the tool's usage and effectiveness with several numerical examples, including both non-trivial low-dimensional nonlinear systems and high-dimensional systems. The repository of the tool can be found at https://git.uwaterloo.ca/hybrid-systems-lab/lyznet.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Two-degree-of-freedom Beam for Rotational Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a two-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric energy harvester designed to harness rotational motion. The harvester is built using a cut-out beam which enables the first two resonant fre-quencies to be located close to each other. A distributed continuous model is developed and validated with experimental results. As the beam undergoes significant displacement due to rotational excitations, the geometric nonlinearity arising from longitudinal displacement is considered in the model. Com-pared to previous literature, the simulation results are much more precise for rotational energy harvest-ing. It is observed that as the rotating speed increases, the increased centrifugal force causes the first resonant frequency to rise while the second resonant frequency decreases. This study explores the po-tential to expand the bandwidth of the harvester using two types of nonlinear external force, namely mechanical stoppers and magnetic force. The results indicate that the proposed harvester can broaden the bandwidth by 1.17 Hz and 0.33 Hz at the first and second resonance frequencies, respectively, by using a stopper on the main beam.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Provision of Distribution Grid Flexibility with Online Feedback Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing distribution grid flexibility for ancillary services requires the coordination and dispatch of requested active and reactive power to a large number of distributed energy resources in underlying grid layers. This paper presents an approach to hierarchically dispatch flexibility requests based on Online Feedback Optimization (OFO). We implement a framework of individual controllers coordinating actors, contributing to flexibility provision, to track a requested operating point at the interface between grid layers. The framework is evaluated in terms of performance during coordination and possible interaction between individual controllers, both central and distributed. Results show high reliability and robustness of the OFO controllers as well as an efficient dispatch of active and reactive power. Its computational efficiency and capabilities in set point tracking during online grid operation are making OFO a promising approach to the flexibility dispatch problem.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness of the leak localization problem in parallel pipe networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of integrated sensor technology (smart flow meters and pressure sensors), various new numerical algorithms for leak localization (a core element of water distribution system operation) have been developed. However, there is a lack of theory regarding the limitations of leak localization. In this work, we contribute to the development of such a theory by introducing an example water network structure with parallel pipes that is tractable for analytical treatment. We define the leak localization problem for this structure and show how many sensors and what conditions are needed for the well-posedness of the problem. We present a formula for the leak position as a function of measurements from these sensors. However, we also highlight the risk of finding false but plausible leak positions in the multiple pipes. We try to answer the questions of how and when the leaking pipe can be isolated. In particular, we show that nonlinearities in the pipes' head loss functions are essential for the well-posedness of the isolation problem. We propose procedures to get around the pitfall of multiple plausible leak positions.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Least-Variance Circuit Parameters Identification of Li-ion Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) are widely used to characterize the impedance and estimate parameters of electrochemical systems such as batteries. We use a generic ECM with ten parameters grouped to model different frequency regions of the Li-ion cell's impedance spectrum. We derive a noise covariance matrix from the measurement model and use it to assign weights for the fitting technique. The paper presents two formulations of the parameters identification problem. Using the properties of the ECM EIS spectra, we propose a method to initialize ECM parameters for the Complex Non-linear Least Squares (CNLS) technique. The paper proposes a novel algorithm for designing the EIS experiments by applying the theory on Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to the identification problem. We show that contributions to the FIM elements strongly depend on the frequencies at which EIS is performed. Hence, the algorithm aims to adjust frequencies such that the most information about parameters is collected. This is done by minimizing the highest variance of ECM parameters defined by CRLB. Results of a numerical experiment show that the estimator is efficient, and frequency adjustment leads to more accurate ECM parameters' identification.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Safety Verification Using Barrier Certificates and Conditional Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic verification of realistic systems to satisfy safety and other temporal requirements has suffered from poor scalability of the employed formal approaches. To design systems with rigorous guarantees, many approaches still rely on exact models of the underlying systems. Since this assumption can rarely be met in practice, models have to be inferred from measurement data or are bypassed completely. Whilst former usually requires the model structure to be known a-priori and immense amounts of data to be available, latter gives rise to a plethora of restrictive mathematical assumptions about the unknown dynamics. In a pursuit of developing scalable formal verification algorithms without shifting the problem to unrealistic assumptions, we employ the concept of barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a compact set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result w.r.t. a set of plausible transition kernels. We show how to solve the resulting program efficiently using sum-of-squares optimization and a Gaussian process envelope. Our approach lifts the need for restrictive assumptions on the system dynamics and uncertainty, and suggests an improvement in the sample complexity of verifying the safety of a system on a tested case study compared to a state-of-the-art approach.</description>

      <title>Socially Integrated Navigation: A Social Acting Robot with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robots are being used on a large scale in various crowded situations and become part of our society. The socially acceptable navigation behavior of a mobile robot with individual human consideration is an essential requirement for scalable applications and human acceptance. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches are recently used to learn a robot's navigation policy and to model the complex interactions between robots and humans. We propose to divide existing DRL-based navigation approaches based on the robot's exhibited social behavior and distinguish between social collision avoidance with a lack of social behavior and socially aware approaches with explicit predefined social behavior. In addition, we propose a novel socially integrated navigation approach where the robot's social behavior is adaptive and emerges from the interaction with humans. The formulation of our approach is derived from a sociological definition, which states that social acting is oriented toward the acting of others. The DRL policy is trained in an environment where other agents interact socially integrated and reward the robot's behavior individually. The simulation results indicate that the proposed socially integrated navigation approach outperforms a socially aware approach in terms of distance traveled, time to completion, and negative impact on all agents within the environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United States DOE Office of Integrated Waste Management program is planning for the transportation, storage, and eventual disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plant sites across the United States. The Next Generation System Analysis Model is an agent-based simulation toolkit that is used for system level simulation and analysis of the SNF inventory in the United States. This tool was developed as part of a collaborative effort between Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The analyst using NGSAM has the ability to define several factors like the number of storage facilities, capacity at each facility, transportation schedules, shipment rates, and other conditions. The primary purpose of NGSAM is to provide the system analyst with the tools to model the integrated waste management system and gain insights on waste management alternatives, impact of storage choices, generating cost estimates, and developing an integrated approach with emphasis on flexibility.</description>

      <title>Control and Automation for Industrial Production Storage Zone: Generation of Optimal Route Using Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image processing (DIP) is of great importance in validating and guaranteeing parameters that ensure the quality of mass-produced products. Therefore, this article focused on developing an industrial automation method for a zone of a production line model using the DIP. The neo-cascade methodology employed allowed for defining each of the stages in an adequate way, ensuring the inclusion of the relevant methods for its development, which finally incurred in the modeling, design, implementation, and testing of an optimal route generation system for a warehouse area, using DIP with optimization guidelines, in conjunction with an embedded platform and the connection to programmable logic controllers (PLCs) for its execution. The system was based on the OpenCV library; tool focused on artificial vision, which was implemented on an object-oriented programming (OOP) platform based on Java language. It generated the optimal route for the automation of processes in a scale warehouse area, using the segmentation of objects and the optimization of flow in networks as pillars, ending with the connection to PLCs as a method of action, which in case of implementation would eliminate constraints such as process inefficiency, the use of manpower to perform these tasks, inadequate use of resources, among others</description>

      <title>A Novel Bioinspired Neuromorphic Vision-based Tactile Sensor for Fast Tactile Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing represents a crucial technique that can enhance the performance of robotic manipulators in various tasks. This work presents a novel bioinspired neuromorphic vision-based tactile sensor that uses an event-based camera to quickly capture and convey information about the interactions between robotic manipulators and their environment. The camera in the sensor observes the deformation of a flexible skin manufactured from a cheap and accessible 3D printed material, whereas a 3D printed rigid casing houses the components of the sensor together. The sensor is tested in a grasping stage classification task involving several objects using a data-driven learning-based approach. The results show that the proposed approach enables the sensor to detect pressing and slip incidents within a speed of 2 ms. The fast tactile perception properties of the proposed sensor makes it an ideal candidate for safe grasping of different objects in industries that involve high-speed pick-and-place operations.</description>

      <title>Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Shape Control of Deformable Linear Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable objects present several challenges to the field of robotic manipulation. One of the tasks that best encapsulates the difficulties arising due to non-rigid behavior is shape control, which requires driving an object to a desired shape. While shape-servoing methods have been shown successful in contexts with approximately linear behavior, they can fail in tasks with more complex dynamics. We investigate an alternative approach, using offline RL to solve a planar shape control problem of a Deformable Linear Object (DLO). To evaluate the effect of material properties, two DLOs are tested namely a soft rope and an elastic cord. We frame this task as a goal-conditioned offline RL problem, and aim to learn to generalize to unseen goal shapes. Data collection and augmentation procedures are proposed to limit the amount of experimental data which needs to be collected with the real robot. We evaluate the amount of augmentation needed to achieve the best results, and test the effect of regularization through behavior cloning on the TD3+BC algorithm. Finally, we show that the proposed approach is able to outperform a shape-servoing baseline in a curvature inversion experiment.</description>

      <title>A General Non-Strict Finsler's Lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general non-strict Finsler's lemma. This result is general in the sense that it does not impose any restrictions on the involved matrices and, thereby, is more broadly applicable than existing non-strict versions of Finsler's lemma that do impose such restrictions. In fact, we show that this new non-strict formulation generalizes both the original strict Finsler's lemma as well as an existing non-strict version. To further illustrate its usefulness, we showcase applications of the non-strict Finsler's lemma in deriving a closed-form solution to the non-strict projection lemma, and a matrix Finsler's lemma, which is useful for data-driven control.</description>

      <title>Coordination in Noncooperative Multiplayer Matrix Games via Reduced Rank Correlated Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordination in multiplayer games enables players to avoid the lose-lose outcome that often arises at Nash equilibria. However, designing a coordination mechanism typically requires the consideration of the joint actions of all players, which becomes intractable in large-scale games. We develop a novel coordination mechanism, termed reduced rank correlated equilibria, which reduces the number of joint actions to be considered and thereby mitigates computational complexity. The idea is to approximate the set of all joint actions with the actions used in a set of pre-computed Nash equilibria via a convex hull operation. In a game with n players and each player having m actions, the proposed mechanism reduces the number of joint actions considered from O(m^n) to O(mn). We demonstrate the application of the proposed mechanism to an air traffic queue management problem. Compared with the correlated equilibrium-a popular benchmark coordination mechanism-the proposed approach is capable of solving a queue management problem involving four thousand times more joint actions. In the meantime, it yields a solution that shows a 58.5% to 99.5% improvement in the fairness indicator and a 1.8% to 50.4% reduction in average delay cost compared to the Nash solution, which does not involve coordination.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coverage Control of Constrained Constant-Speed Unicycle Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel distributed coverage controller for a multi-agent system with constant-speed unicycle robots (CSUR). The work is motivated by the limitation of the conventional method that does not ensure the satisfaction of hard state- and input-dependent constraints and leads to feasibility issues for multi-CSUR systems. In this paper, we solve these problems by designing a novel coverage cost function and a saturated gradient-search-based control law. Invariant set theory and Lyapunov-based techniques are used to prove the state-dependent confinement and the convergence of the system state to the optimal coverage configuration, respectively. The controller is implemented in a distributed manner based on a novel communication standard among the agents. A series of simulation case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed coverage controller in different initial conditions and with control parameters. A comparison study in simulation reveals the advantage of the proposed method in terms of avoiding infeasibility. The experiment study verifies the applicability of the method to real robots with uncertainties. The development procedure of the method from theoretical analysis to experimental validation provides a novel framework for multi-agent system coordinate control with complex agent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bearing-Constrained Leader-Follower Formation of Single-Integrators with Disturbance Rejection: Adaptive Variable-Structure Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of stabilizing a leader-follower formation specified by a set of bearing constraints and being disturbed by unknown uniformly bounded disturbance. A set of leaders are positioned at the desired positions, while each follower agent is modeled by a single integrator with disturbance of which the upper bound is unavailable for the control design. Adaptive variable-structure formation control laws using only displacements or bearing vectors are provided to stabilize the agents to a desired formation. Thanks to the adaptive mechanism, the control laws require neither the information of the bearing Laplacian nor the directions and the upper bounds of the disturbance. It is further proved that when the leaders are moving with the same bounded uniformly continuous velocity, the moving target formation can still be achieved under the proposed control laws. Simulation results are also given to support the stability analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new connectivity condition on the information flow between UAVs to achieve coordinated path following. The information flow is directional, so that the underlying communication network topology is represented by a time-varying digraph. We assume that this digraph is connected in an integral sense. This is a much more general assumption than the one currently used in the literature. Under this assumption, it is shown that a decentralized coordination controller ensures exponential convergence of the coordination error vector to a neighborhood of zero. The efficacy of the algorithm is confirmed with simulation results.</description>

      <title>Composition of Control Barrier Functions With Differing Relative Degrees for Safety Under Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for guaranteed safety subject to input constraints (e.g., actuator limits) using a composition of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs). First, we present a method for constructing a single CBF from multiple CBFs, which can have different relative degrees. This construction relies on a soft minimum function and yields a CBF whose $0$-superlevel set is a subset of the union of the $0$-superlevel sets of all the CBFs used in the construction. Next, we extend the approach to systems with input constraints. Specifically, we introduce control dynamics that allow us to express the input constraints as CBFs in the closed-loop state (i.e., the state of the system and the controller). The CBFs constructed from input constraints do not have the same relative degree as the safety constraints. Thus, the composite soft-minimum CBF construction is used to combine the input-constraint CBFs with the safety-constraint CBFs. Finally, we present a feasible real-time-optimization control that guarantees that the state remains in the $0$-superlevel set of the composite soft-minimum CBF. We demonstrate these approaches on a nonholonomic ground robot example.</description>

      <title>Distributed multi-UAV shield formation based on virtual surface constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for the deployment of a multi-agent system of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a shield with potential applications in the protection of infrastructures. The shield shape is modeled as a quadric surface in the 3D space. To design the desired formation (target distances between agents and interconnections), an algorithm is proposed where the input parameters are just the parametrization of the quadric and the number of agents of the system. This algorithm guarantees that the agents are almost uniformly distributed over the virtual surface and that the topology is a Delaunay triangulation. Moreover, a new method is proposed to check if the resulting triangulation meets that condition and is executed locally. Because this topology ensures that the formation is rigid, a distributed control law based on the gradient of a potential function is proposed to acquire the desired shield shape and proofs of stability are provided. Finally, simulation and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Smooth Control via Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode for Distributed Space Telescope Demonstration Mission by CubeSat Formation Flying</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the efficiency of nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode and adaptive smooth control method for the distributed space telescope demonstration mission. The distributed space telescope has a flexible focal length that corresponds to the relative position of the formation flying concept. The precise formation flying technology by CubeSats enhances the utility of distributed space systems with low costs. The propulsion systems for CubeSats usually have restricted degrees of freedom. Since the scientific mission requires continuous orbit control, the attitude and orbit control system mutually affect the control performance. The nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode has the advantage of a fast convergence rate and is able to improve the control performance. The adaptive smooth controller designed for the SISO system is expanded and applied to the attitude and orbit control system. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the adaptive smooth controller based on the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation by Two Agents with Different Feature Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimation of a function by a system consisting of two agents and a fusion center. The two agents collect data comprising of samples of an independent variable and the corresponding value of a dependent variable. The objective of the system is to collaboratively estimate the function without any exchange of data among the members of the system. To this end, we propose the following framework. The agents are given a set of features using which they construct suitable function spaces to formulate and solve the estimation problems locally. The estimated functions are uploaded to a fusion space where an optimization problem is solved to fuse the estimates (also known as meta-learning) to obtain the system estimate of the mapping. The fused function is then downloaded by the agents to gather knowledge about the other agents estimate of the function. With respect to the framework, we present the following: a systematic construction of fusion space given the features of the agents; the derivation of an uploading operator for the agents to upload their estimated functions to a fusion space; the derivation of a downloading operator for the fused function to be downloaded. Through an example on least squares regression, we illustrate the distributed estimation architecture that has been developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projection lemma (often also referred to as the elimination lemma) is one of the most powerful and useful tools in the context of linear matrix inequalities for system analysis and control. In its traditional formulation, the projection lemma only applies to strict inequalities, however, in many applications we naturally encounter non-strict inequalities. As such, we present, in this note, a non-strict projection lemma that generalizes both its original strict formulation as well as an earlier non-strict version. We demonstrate several applications of our result in robust linear-matrix-inequality-based marginal stability analysis and stabilization, a matrix S-lemma, which is useful in (direct) data-driven control applications, and matrix dilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Koopman Control Family (KCF), a mathematical framework for modeling general discrete-time nonlinear control systems with the aim of providing a solid theoretical foundation for the use of Koopman-based methods in systems with inputs. We demonstrate that the concept of KCF captures the behavior of nonlinear control systems on a (potentially infinite-dimensional) function space. By employing a generalized notion of subspace invariance under the KCF, we establish a universal form for finite-dimensional models, which encompasses the commonly used linear, bilinear, and linear switched models as specific instances. In cases where the subspace is not invariant under the KCF, we propose a method for approximating models in general form and characterize the model's accuracy using the concept of invariance proximity. We end by discussing how the proposed framework naturally lends itself to data-driven modeling of control systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider third-order dynamic systems which have integral feedback action and discontinuous relay disturbance. More specifically for applications, our focus is on the integral plus state-feedback control of motion systems with the discontinuous Coulomb-type friction. We resume the attractive stiction region, where the hybrid system has also solutions in Filippov sense, while the motion trajectories remain in an idle state (that we call `stiction') until the sliding-mode condition becomes violated through the integral action. We analyze the conditions for occurrence of the slowly converging stick-slip cycles. We also show that the hybrid system is globally but only asymptotically and almost always not exponentially stable. A particular case of exponential convergence can appear for some initial values, assuming the characteristic equation of the linear subsystem has only the real roots. Illustrative numerical examples are provided alongside with the developed analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is pervasive in research and industry. However, designing the cost function and the constraints of the MPC to maximize closed-loop performance remains an open problem. To achieve optimal tuning, we propose a backpropagation scheme that solves a policy optimization problem with nonlinear system dynamics and MPC policies. We enforce the system dynamics using linearization and allow the MPC problem to contain elements that depend on the current system state and on past MPC solutions. Moreover, we propose a simple extension that can deal with losses of feasibility. Our approach, unlike other methods in the literature, enjoys convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Exact Consistency Tests for Gaussian Mixture Filters using Normalized Deviation Squared Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating dynamic consistency in discrete time probabilistic filters that approximate stochastic system state densities with Gaussian mixtures. Dynamic consistency means that the estimated probability distributions correctly describe the actual uncertainties. As such, the problem of consistency testing naturally arises in applications with regards to estimator tuning and validation. However, due to the general complexity of the density functions involved, straightforward approaches for consistency testing of mixture-based estimators have remained challenging to define and implement. This paper derives a new exact result for Gaussian mixture consistency testing within the framework of normalized deviation squared (NDS) statistics. It is shown that NDS test statistics for generic multivariate Gaussian mixture models exactly follow mixtures of generalized chi-square distributions, for which efficient computational tools are available. The accuracy and utility of the resulting consistency tests are numerically demonstrated on static and dynamic mixture estimation examples.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Tracking Controller for Ramp and Sinusoidal Reference Signals using Robust Positive Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an output feedback controller capable of ensuring steady-state offset-free tracking for ramp and sinusoidal reference signals while ensuring local stability and state and input constraints fulfillment. The proposed solution is derived by jointly exploiting the internal model principle, polyhedral robust positively invariant arguments, and the Extended Farkas' Lemma. In particular, by considering a generic class of output feedback controller equipped with a feedforward term, a proportional effect, and a double integrator, we offline design the controller's gains by means of a single bilinear optimization problem. A peculiar feature of the proposed design is that the sets of all the admissible reference signals and the plant's initial conditions are also offline determined. Simulation results are provided to testify to the effectiveness of the proposed tracking controller and its capability to deal with both state and input constraints.</description>
