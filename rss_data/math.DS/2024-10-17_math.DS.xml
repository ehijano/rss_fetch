      <title>Preservation of dissipativity in dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with predetermined Lyapunov functions play an important role in many areas of applied mathematics, physics and engineering: dynamic optimization methods (objective functions and their modifications), machine learning (loss functions), thermodynamics and kinetics (free energy and other thermodynamic potentials), adaptive control (various objective functions, stabilization quality criteria and other Lyapunov functions). Dimensionality reduction is one of the main challenges in the modern era of big data and big models. Dimensionality reduction for systems with Lyapunov functions requires it preserving dissipativity: the reduced system must also have a Lyapunov function, which is expected to be a restriction of the original Lyapunov function on the manifold of the reduced motion. An additional complexity of the problem is that the equations of motion themselves are often unknown in detail in advance and must be determined in the course of the study, while the Lyapunov function could be determined based on incomplete data. Therefore, the projection problem arises: for a given Lyapunov function, find a field of projectors such that the reduction of it any dissipative system is again a dissipative system. In this paper, we present an explicit construction of such projectors and prove their uniqueness. We have also taken the first step beyond the approximation by manifolds. This is required in many applications. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of monotone trees and find a projection of dissipative systems onto monotone trees that preserves dissipativity.</description>

      <title>Almost sure convergence of differentially positive systems on a globally orderable Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially positive systems are the nonlinear systems whose linearization along trajectories preserves a cone field on a smooth Riemannian manifold. One of the embryonic forms for cone fields in reality is originated from the general relativity. Out of a set of measure zero, we show that almost every orbits will converge to equilibrium. This solved a reduced version (from a measure-theoretic perspective) of Forni-Sepulchre's conjecture in 2016 for globally orderable manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium states for an open class of non-uniformly expanding local homeomorphisms defined by a mild condition such that for some iterate each point admits at least one contracting inverse branch. We prove the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states and the differentiability of statistical quantities (such as the equilibrium states and the free energy function) with respect to the dynamical system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical property of the naive mean dimension for continuous actions of any countable group on compact metrizable spaces. It is shown that naive mean dimension serves as an upper bound of sofic mean dimension for actions of nonamenable groups. For algebraic actions we obtain more satisfactory results by looking at the naive version of mean rank for modules over integral group rings. We also consider the naive metric mean dimension and investigate its relations with sofic metric mean dimension.</description>

      <title>Area spectral rigidity for axially symmetric and Radon domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that $(a)$ any finitely smooth axially symmetric strictly convex domain, with everywhere positive curvature and sufficiently close to an ellipse, and $(b)$ any finitely smooth centrally symmetric strictly convex domain, even-rationally integrable, with everywhere positive curvature and sufficiently close to an ellipse area spectrally rigid. This means that any area-isospectral family of domains in these classes is necessarily equi-affine. We use the same technique -- adapted to symplectic billiards -- of the paper by De Simoi, Kaloshin, and Wei (2017). The novelty is that the result holds for axially symmetric domains, as in the cited paper, as well as for a subset of centrally symmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Nonlinear Model Updating in Structural Dynamics Using a Novel Likelihood Function within the Bayesian-MCMC Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study presents a novel approach for stochastic nonlinear model updating in structural dynamics, employing a Bayesian framework integrated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for parameter estimation by using an approximated likelihood function. The proposed methodology is applied to both numerical and experimental cases. The paper commences by introducing Bayesian inference and its constituents: the likelihood function, prior distribution, and posterior distribution. The resonant decay method is employed to extract backbone curves, which capture the non-linear behaviour of the system. A mathematical model based on a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system is formulated, and backbone curves are obtained from time response data. Subsequently, MCMC sampling is employed to estimate the parameters using both numerical and experimental data. The obtained results demonstrate the convergence of the Markov chain, present parameter trace plots, and provide estimates of posterior distributions of updated parameters along with their uncertainties. Experimental validation is performed on a cantilever beam system equipped with permanent magnets and electromagnets. The proposed methodology demonstrates promising results in estimating parameters of stochastic non-linear dynamical systems. Through the use of the proposed likelihood functions using backbone curves, the probability distributions of both linear and non-linear parameters are simultaneously identified. Based on this view, the necessity to segregate stochastic linear and non-linear model updating is eliminated.</description>

      <title>Parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment in the transmission dynamics of rabies in humans and dogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rabies remains a pressing global public health issue, demanding effective modeling and control strategies. This study focused on developing a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to estimate parameters and assess uncertainties related to the transmission dynamics of rabies in humans and dogs. To determine model parameters and address uncertainties, next-generation matrices were utilized to calculate the basic reproduction number ${\cal R}_{0}$. Furthermore, the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient was used to identify parameters that significantly influence model outputs. The analysis of equilibrium states revealed that the rabies-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when $R_0&lt;1$, whereas the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when ${\cal R}_{0}\geq 1$. To reduce the severity of rabies and align with the Global Rabies Control (GRC) initiative by 2030, the study recommends implementing control strategies targeting indoor domestic dogs.</description>

      <title>Time-Varyingness in Auction Breaks Revenue Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auction is one of the most representative buying-selling systems. A celebrated study shows that the seller's expected revenue is equal in equilibrium, regardless of the type of auction, typically first-price and second-price auctions. Here, however, we hypothesize that when some auction environments vary with time, this revenue equivalence may not be maintained. In second-price auctions, the equilibrium strategy is robustly feasible. Conversely, in first-price auctions, the buyers must continue to adapt their strategies according to the environment of the auction. Surprisingly, we prove that revenue equivalence can be broken in both directions. First-price auctions bring larger or smaller revenue than second-price auctions, case by case, depending on how the value of an item varies. Our experiments also demonstrate revenue inequivalence in various scenarios, where the value varies periodically or randomly. This study uncovers a phenomenon, the breaking of revenue equivalence by the time-varyingness in auctions, that likely occurs in real-world auctions, revealing its underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Stability properties for subgroups generated by return words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Return words are a classical tool for studying shift spaces with low factor complexity. In recent years, their projection inside groups have attracted some attention, for instance in the context of dendric shift spaces, of generation of pseudorandom numbers (through the welldoc property), and of profinite invariants of shift spaces. Aiming at unifying disparate works, we introduce a notion of stability for subgroups generated by return words. Within this framework, we revisit several existing results and generalize some of them. We also study general aspects of stability, such as decidability or closure under certain operations.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian bridge: A physics-driven generative framework for targeted pattern control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns arise spontaneously in a range of systems spanning the sciences, and their study typically focuses on mechanisms to understand their evolution in space-time. Increasingly, there has been a transition towards controlling these patterns in various functional settings, with implications for engineering. Here, we combine our knowledge of a general class of dynamical laws for pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems, and the power of stochastic optimal control approaches to present a framework that allows us to control patterns at multiple scales, which we dub the "Hamiltonian bridge". We use a mapping between stochastic many-body Lagrangian physics and deterministic Eulerian pattern forming PDEs to leverage our recent approach utilizing the Feynman-Kac-based adjoint path integral formulation for the control of interacting particles and generalize this to the active control of patterning fields. We demonstrate the applicability of our computational framework via numerical experiments on the control of phase separation with and without a conserved order parameter, self-assembly of fluid droplets, coupled reaction-diffusion equations and finally a phenomenological model for spatio-temporal tissue differentiation. We interpret our numerical experiments in terms of a theoretical understanding of how the underlying physics shapes the geometry of the pattern manifold, altering the transport paths of patterns and the nature of pattern interpolation. We finally conclude by showing how optimal control can be utilized to generate complex patterns via an iterative control protocol over pattern forming pdes which can be casted as gradient flows. All together, our study shows how we can systematically build in physical priors into a generative framework for pattern control in non-equilibrium systems across multiple length and time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the type and typeset invariants for equicontinuous group actions on Cantor sets; that is, for generalized odometers. These invariants are collections of equivalence classes of asymptotic Steinitz numbers associated to the action. We show the type is an invariant of the return equivalence class of the action. We introduce the notion of commensurable typesets, and show that two actions which are return equivalent have commensurable typesets. Examples are given to illustrate the properties of the type and typeset invariants. The type and typeset invariants are used to define homeomorphism invariants for solenoidal manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we develop a novel functional analytic approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in establishing the existence, uniqueness, regularity of disintegration, and statistical properties of equilibrium states associated with a class of discontinuous dynamics. We apply this approach to a group of piecewise partially hyperbolic maps and a set of potentials. Furthermore, we prove several limit theorems, such as exponential decay of correlations, and propose certain conjectures. Additionally, we provide a set of examples where these results can be applied, including discontinuous dynamics semi-conjugated to the Manneville-Pomeau map.</description>

      <title>An embedding theorem for multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krieger's embedding theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift to embed in a given topologically mixing $\mathbb{Z}$-subshift of finite type. For some $\mathbb{Z}^d$-subshifts of finite type, Lightwood characterized the \emph{aperiodic} subsystems. In the current paper we prove a new embedding theorem for a class of subshifts of finite type over any countable abelian group. Our main theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift $X$ to embed inside a given subshift of finite type $Y$ that satisfies a certain condition. For the particular case of $\mathbb{Z}$-subshifts, our new theorem coincides with Krieger's theorem. In particular, our result gives the first complete characterization of the subsystems of the multidimensional full shift $Y= A^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$. The natural condition on the target subshift $Y$, introduced explicitly for the first time in the current paper, is called the map extension property. It was introduced implicitly by Mike Boyle in the early 1980's for $\mathbb{Z}$-subshifts, and is closely related to the notion of an absolute retract, introduced by Borsuk in the 1930's. A $\mathbb{Z}$-subshift has the map extension property if and only if it is a topologically mixing subshift of finite type. Over abelian groups, a subshift has the map extension property if and only if it is a contractible SFT as shown in work of Poirier and Salo. We also establish a new theorem regarding lower entropy factors of multidimensional subshifts, that extends Boyle's lower entropy factor theorem from the one-dimensional case.</description>

Abstract: We prove that core entropy is H\"older continuous as a function of external angles for a large class of quadratic polynomials that are non-recurrent with respect to angle-doubling, in particular all of them that exhibit a finite Hubbard tree. The result follows from a symbolic analysis of the Mandelbrot set and the dynamics of Hubbard trees in terms of kneading sequences which has been established in previous work.</description>

Let sequences ${ p(n)},{ q(n)}$ satisfy the property $ p(n+1)- p(n), \ q(n+1)- q(n)\ \to\ +\infty.$ Then there exist automorphisms $S,T$ with simple singular spectrum and a set $C$ such that the sequence $ \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mu(S^{ p(n)}C\cap T^{ q(n)}C)/N$ diverges. We give also sketch-example of non-recurrence for a pair of automorphisms.</description>
