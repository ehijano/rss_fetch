      <title>Semigroup Congruences and Subsemigroups of the Direct Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate semigroups $S$ which have the property that every subsemigroup of $S\times S$ which contains the diagonal $\{ (s,s)\colon s\in S\}$ is necessarily a congruence on $S$. We call such $S$ a DSC semigroup. It is well known that all finite groups are DSC, and easy to see that every DSC semigroup must be simple. Building on this, we show that for broad classes of semigroups -- including periodic, stable, inverse and several well-known types of simple semigroups -- the only DSC members are groups. However, it turns out that there exist non-group DSC semigroups, which we obtain utilising a construction introduced by Byleen for the purpose of constructing interesting congruence-free semigroups. Such examples can additionally be regular or bisimple.</description>

      <title>Schur roots and tilting modules of acyclic quivers over commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be a finite acyclic quiver and $A_Q$ the cluster algebra of $Q$. It is well-known that for each field $k$, the additive equivalence classes of support tilting $kQ$-modules correspond bijectively with the clusters of $A_Q$. The aim of this paper is to generalize this result to any ring indecomposable commutative Noetherian ring $R$, that is, the additive equivalence classes of 2-term silting complexes of $RQ$ correspond bijectively with the clusters of $A_Q$. As an application, for a Dynkin quiver $Q$, we prove that the torsion classes of $\mathrm{mod} RQ$ corresponds bijectively with the order preserving maps from $\mathrm{Spec} R$ to the set of clusters.</description>

      <title>Limits of group algebras for growing symmetric groups and wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S(\infty)$ denote the infinite symmetric group formed by the finitary permutations of the set of natural numbers; this is a countable group. We introduce its virtual group algebra, a completion of the conventional group algebra $\mathbb C[S(\infty)]$. The virtual group algebra is obtained by taking large-$n$ limits of the finite-dimensional group algebras $\mathbb C[S(n)]$ in the so-called tame representations of $S(\infty)$. We establish a connection with the centralizer construction of Molev-Olshanski [J. Algebra, 237 (2001), 302-341; arXiv:math/0002165] and Drinfeld-Lusztig degenerate affine Hecke algebras. This makes it possible to describe the structure of the virtual group algebra. Then we extend the results to wreath products $G\wr S(\infty)$ with arbitrary finite groups $G$.</description>

      <title>On deformations of Azumaya algebras with quadratic pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a tangent-obstruction theory for Azumaya algebras equipped with a quadratic pair. Under the assumption that either 2 is a global unit or the algebra is of degree 2, we show how the deformation theory of these objects reduces to the deformation theory of the underlying Azumaya algebra. Namely, if the underlying Azumaya algebra has unobstructed deformations then so does the quadratic pair.
  On the other hand, in the purely characteristic 2 setting, we construct an Azumaya algebra with unobstructed deformations which can be equipped with a quadratic pair such that the associated triple has obstructed deformations. Our example is a biquaternion Azumaya algebra on an Igusa surface.
  Independently from the above results, we also introduce a new obstruction for quadratic pairs, existing only in characteristic 2, which is intermediate to both the strong and weak obstructions that were recently introduced by Gille, Neher, and the second named author. This intermediate obstruction characterizes when a canonical extension of the Lie algebra sheaf of the automorphism group scheme of some quadratic triple is split.</description>

      <title>Numerical homological regularities over positively graded algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerical regularities for complexes over noncommutative noetherian locally finite $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras $A$ such as CM (cm)-regularity, Tor (tor)-regularity (Ext (ext)-regularity) and Ex (ex)-regularity, which are the supremum or infimum degrees of some associated canonical complexes. We show that for any right bounded complex $X$ with finitely generated cohomologies, the supremum degree of $R\underline{\text{Hom}}_A(X, A_0)$ coincides with the opposite of the infimum degree of $X$ if $A_0$ is semisimple. If $A$ has a balanced dualizing complex and $A_0$ is semisimple, we prove that the CM-regularity of $X$ coincides with the supremum degree of $R\underline{\text{Hom}}_A(A_0,X)$ for any left bounded complex $X$ with finitely generated cohomologies.
  Several inequalities concerning the numerical regularities and the supremum or infimum degree of derived Hom or derived tensor complexes are given for noncommutative noetherian locally finite $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras. Some of these are generalizations of J\o rgensen's results on the inequalities between the CM-regularity and Tor-regularity, some are new even in the connected graded case. Conditions are given under which the inequalities become equalities by establishing two technical lemmas.
  Following Kirkman, Won and Zhang, we also use the numerical AS-regularity (resp. little AS-regularity) to study Artin-Schelter regular property (finite-dimensional property) for noetherian $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras. We prove that the numerical AS-regularity of $A$ is zero if and only if that $A$ is an $\mathbb{N}$-graded AS-regular algebra under some mild conditions, which generalizes a result of Dong-Wu and a result of Kirkman-Won-Zhang. If $A$ has a balanced dualizing complex and $A_0$ is semisimple, we prove that the little AS-regularity of $A$ is zero if and only if $A$ is finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Irredundant Generating Sets for Matrix Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field. We show that the largest irredundant generating sets for the algebra of $n\times n $ matrices over $F$ have $2n-1$ elements when $n&gt;1$. (A result of Laffey states that the answer is $2n-2$ when $n&gt;2$, but its proof contains an error.) We further give a classification of the largest irredundant generating sets when $n\in\{2,3\}$ and $F$ is algebraically closed. We use this description to compute the dimension of the variety of $(2n-1)$-tuples of $n\times n$ matrices which form an irredundant generating set when $n\in\{2,3\}$, and draw some consequences to Zariski-locally redundant generation of Azumaya algebras. In the course of proving the classification, we also determine the largest sets $S$ of subspaces of $F^3$ with the property that every $V\in S$ admits a matrix stabilizing every subspace in $S-\{V\}$ and not stabilizing $V$.</description>
