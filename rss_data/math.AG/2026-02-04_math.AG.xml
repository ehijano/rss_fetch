      <title>A moduli space of character sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study de Rham character sheaves on a commutative connected algebraic group $G$, defined as multiplicative line bundles with integrable connection. We construct a group algebraic space $G^\flat$ representing their moduli problem on seminormal test schemes, and we investigate its functoriality and geometry. The main technical ingredient is a study of extension sheaves on the de Rham space $G_\text{dR}$. An appendix provides self-contained, elementary proofs of basic results on de Rham spaces that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Marvelous slices of orthogonal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of $4 \times 4$ special orthogonal matrices with zeros on the diagonal decomposes into the union of $14$ irreducible surfaces whose intersections are beautifully encoded by the cuboctahedron. Using this decomposition, we exhibit a totally real witness set for $SO(4)$. We explain how to obtain a similar decomposition for $SO(5)$, where the $64$ components can be grouped to obtain such a correspondence with the face lattice of a $3$-polytope. We show that no such pattern exists for $SO(6)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$. We consider the commuting variety and the commuting nilpotent variety of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, namely the sets $\mathcal{C}_2(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})=\{ (x,y) \in \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \times \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \mid [x,y]=0\}$ and $\mathcal{C}_2^{\text{nil}}(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})=\{ (x,y) \in \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \times \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \mid x,y \text{ nilpotent, } [x,y]=0\}$ and prove that they are both irreducible, of dimensions $\dim(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}) + 2n$ and $\dim(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}) + n-1$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Refined invariants for Abelian surfaces: between polynomiality and modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical refined invariants for toric surfaces, introduced Block and G{\"o}ttsche, are obtained couting tropical curves with a Laurent polynomial multiplicity. Brugall{\'e} and Jaramillo-Puentes then exhibited a polynomial behavior of the coefficients of this Laurent polynomial, seen as function on the curve degree. The authors provided explicit formula for small genus, involving quasi-modular forms. Inspired by the toric setting, the first-named author defined refined invariants for abelian surfaces and extended the polynomiality result. In this paper, we further study this regularity for abelian surfaces, providing explicit formulas involving quasi-modular forms. This resonates with the small genus cases of the toric setting.</description>

      <title>n-th Tropical Nevanlinna Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the tropical Nevanlinna theory is extended for piecewise polynomial continuous functions. By constructing the $n$-th Poisson-Jensen formula, the $n$-th tropical counting, proximity, and characteristic functions are introduced, which have some different properties compared to the classical tropical setting. Then, not only is the $n$-th version of the second main theorem for tropical homogeneous polynomials obtained, but also a tropical second main theorem for ordinary Fermat type polynomials is acquired. Moreover, by estimating the tropical logarithmic derivative with a growth assumption pointwise, a strong equality is proved. This equality illustrates the relationship between $\sum_{i=0}^{m}N(r, 1_{0}\oslash f_{i})$ and the ramification term $N(r, C_{0}(f_{0}, \cdots, f_{m}))$, implying that there is no natural tropical truncated version of the second main theorem for shift operators.</description>

Abstract: The first goal of this article is to survey recent progress in Brill--Noether theory, including both the study of the moduli space of maps from a curve to projective space and the geometry of the resulting curves in projective space. The second goal is to introduce newcomers to some of the important techniques that have been introduced or developed in the last decade that made these advances possible.</description>

      <title>Learning Fast Monomial Orders for Gr\"obner Basis Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of Gr\"obner basis computation, the standard engine for solving systems of polynomial equations, depends on the choice of monomial ordering. Despite a near-continuum of possible monomial orders, most implementations rely on static heuristics such as GrevLex, guided primarily by expert intuition. We address this gap by casting the selection of monomial orderings as a reinforcement learning problem over the space of admissible orderings. Our approach leverages domain-informed reward signals that accurately reflect the computational cost of Gr\"obner basis computations and admits efficient Monte Carlo estimation. Experiments on benchmark problems from systems biology and computer vision show that the resulting learned policies consistently outperform standard heuristics, yielding substantial reductions in computational cost. Moreover, we find that these policies resist distillation into simple interpretable models, providing empirical evidence that deep reinforcement learning allows the agents to exploit non-linear geometric structure beyond the scope of traditional heuristics.</description>

      <title>Norms and Hermitian $\mathrm{K}$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past century, cohomology operations have played a crucial role in homotopy theory and its applications. A powerful framework for constructing such operations is the theory of commutative algebras in spectra. In this article, we discuss an algebro-geometric analogue of this framework, called the theory of normed algebras in motivic spectra. Specifically, we show that the motivic spectrum $\mathrm{ko}$ representing very effective hermitian $\mathrm{K}$-theory can be equipped with a normed algebra structure, and that the orientation map $\mathrm{MSL} \to \mathrm{ko}$ respects this structure. The main step will be showing that the motivic infinite loop space machine is compatible with norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of non-geometric Bridgeland stability conditions on certain wrapped Fukaya categories, using homological mirror symmetry and categorical K\"unneth formulae. These stability conditions correspond to certain holomorphic volume forms, under which we prove that every stable object admits a special Lagrangian representative. This provides the first higher-dimensional examples of stability conditions away from the large complex structure limit for which ``stable implies special Lagrangian" is proved.</description>

Abstract: An algebraic approach is presented for the valuative interpolation problem, which recovers and generalizes prior characterizations known in the complex analytic setting by the authors. We use the asymptotic Samuel function to give the characterization of the existence of valuative interpolation. We also give a characterization of the existence in the infinite valuative interpolation problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification of noncommutative quadric hypersurfaces is one of the major projects in noncommutative algebraic geometry. In recent years, we are dedicated to complete the classification of noncommutative central conics. To achieve this goal, we and other authors develop some theories to study and classify some classes of noncommutative quadric hypersurfaces in a series of papers. Finally, in this paper, we completely classify noncommutative central conics by developing the general theory of homogenization and dehomogenization for noncommutative algebras and by previous results. As a main result, we show that there are bijections among the following sets of objects (i) the set of isomorphism classes of $4$-dimensional Frobenius algebras, (ii) the set of isomorphism classes of noncommutative affine pencils of conics, and (iii) the set of isomorphism classes of noncommutative central conics.</description>

      <title>Squares in arithmetic progression over quadratic extensions of number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study arithmetic progressions of squares over quadratic extensions of number fields. Using a method inspired by an approach of Mordell, we characterize such progressions as quadratic points on a genus $5$ curve. Specifically, we determine the set of $K$-quadratic points on this curve under certain conditions on the base field $K$. Our main results rely on the algebraic properties of specific elliptic curves after performing a base change to suitable number fields. As a consequence, we establish that, under appropriate assumptions, any non-elementary arithmetic progression of five or six squares properly defined over a quadratic extension of $K$ must be of a specific form. Moreover, we prove the non-existence of such progressions of length greater than six under these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Higher-Form Connections in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of higher-form connections on principal $\infty$-bundles in differential geometry. This is achieved by developing the formal differentiation and integration of maps from smooth manifolds to derived stacks with sufficient deformation theory. That allows us to introduce the Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid of a principal $\infty$-bundle and establish its global sections as the $L_\infty$-algebra of the derived higher symmetry group of the bundle. We define the space of $p$-form connections on an $\infty$-bundle as the space of order $p$ splittings of its Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid. We demonstrate that our new concept of derived geometric $p$-form connections recovers the known notion of connections on higher U(1)-bundles defined via \v{C}ech-Deligne differential cocycles. We further relate the $L_\infty$-algebras of derived higher symmetries of higher U(1)-bundles and higher Courant algebroids. Some applications in higher gauge theory and in supergravity are mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monodromy of hypergeometric functions can govern the properties of the functions themselves. Previously, the second and third authors studied the commensurability relations among monodromy groups of the Appell--Lauricella hypergeometric functions using Deligne--Mostow theory and the geometric correspondence between curves and surfaces. In this paper, we apply the same construction to obtain transformation formulas among these hypergeometric functions. This also provides an alternative approach to some of Goursat's quadratic transformations via double integrals and Fubini's theorem.</description>

Abstract: Here we completely determine the spin parity of $k$-differentials with prescribed zero and pole orders on Riemann surfaces of genus zero and one. This result was previously obtained conditionally by the first author and Quentin Gendron assuming the truth of a number-theoretic hypothesis Conjecture A.10. We prove this hypothesis by reformulating it in terms of Jacobi symbols, reducing the proof to a combinatorial identity and standard facts about Jacobi symbols. The proof was obtained by AxiomProver and the system formalized the proof of the combinatorial identity in Lean/Mathlib (see the Appendix).</description>

      <title>On compactifications of the SL(2,C) character varieties of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses some conjectures and questions regarding the absolute and relative compactifications of the $\SL(2,\C)$-character variety of an $n$-punctured Riemann surface without boundary. We study a class of projective compactifications determined by ideal triangulations of the surface and prove explicit results concerning the boundary divisors of these compactifications. Notably, we establish that the boundary divisors are toric varieties and confirm a well-known conjecture asserting that the (dual) boundary complex of any (positive dimensional) relative character variety is a sphere. In a different vein, we enhance and streamline Komyo's compactification method, which utilizes a projective compactification of $\SL(2,\C)$ to compactify the (relative) character varieties. Specifically, we construct a uniform relative compactification over the base space of $\C^n$ and determine its monodromy, addressing a question posed by Simpson.</description>

      <title>Cohomological flatness over discrete valuation rings: numerical and logarithmic criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give sufficient conditions for cohomological flatness (in dimension 0) over discrete valuation rings, generalizing classical results of Raynaud in two different ways. The first is a higher dimensional generalization of Raynaud's numerical criteria, in both the variant for the multiplicity of the special fibre and that for the index of the generic fibre. The second is a logarithmic criterion: we show that, over a log regular base, a proper flat fs log smooth morphism is cohomologically flat in dimension 0. We apply this latter result to curves and torsors under abelian varieties with good reduction, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the log smoothness of their regular models over arbitrary discrete valuation rings.</description>

      <title>Two remarks on asymptotically log Fano pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotically log Fano pairs were introduced by Cheltsov and Rubinstein, generalising a definition of Maeda. They have received attention in the last decade within the theory of K-stability, as they approximate log Calabi Yau pairs while staying in the log Fano setting. In this note, written for the ZAG Proceedings, we summarise our talk on 1st September 2020 (Day of Knowledge) given on Zoom during the 24-hour ZAG Marathon. In the talk, we reported on joint work with P. Cascini and Y. Rubinstein, on the classification of the two-dimensional case, known as asymptotically log del Pezzo pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) invariants associated to $cA_n$ singularities. We (1) generalize GV invariants to crepant partial resolutions of $cA_n$ singularities, (2) show that generalized GV invariants also satisfy Toda's formula and are determined by their associated contraction algebra, (3) give filtration structures on the parameter space of contraction algebras associated to $cA_n$ crepant resolutions with respect to generalized GV invariants, and (4) numerically constrain the possible tuples of GV invariants that can arise. We further give all the tuples that arise from GV invariants of $cA_2$ crepant resolutions.</description>

      <title>Low degree subvarieties of universal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study irreducible subvarieties of the universal hypersurface $\mathcal{X}/B$ of degree $d$ and dimension $n$. We prove that when $d$ is sufficiently large, a degree $kd$ subvariety $Z$ which dominates $B$ comes from intersection with a family of degree $k$ projective varieties parametrized by $B$. This answers a question raised independently by Farb and Ma. Our main tools consist of a Grassmannian technique due to Riedl and Yang, a theorem of Mumford-Roitman on rational equivalence of zero-cycles, and an analysis of Cayley-Bacharach conditions in the presence of a Galois action. We also show that the large degree assumption is necessary; for $d=3$, rational points are dense in $\text{Sym}^dX_{k(B)}$, and in particular are not collinear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laurent Lafforgue's presentation of a Grassmannian Gr$^{d, E}$ naturally comes equipped with the induced action of a subtorus $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$ of PGL$(E)$. By investigating the defining ideals of $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$-orbit closures through general points of Gr$^{d,E}$ and studying their degenerations, we obtain a morphsim $\mathfrak{q}: \mathbb{F}^{d, E_\bullet} \to \mathbb{H}^{d, E_{\bullet}}$ such that $\mathbb{H}^{d, E_\bullet}$, termed the $\mathfrak{G}$-quotient of Gr$^{d,E}$ by $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$, is birational to $[{\rm Gr}^{d, E}/\mathbb{T}_\bullet]$, and $\mathfrak{q}$, termed $\mathfrak{G}$-family of Gr$^{d,E}$ by $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$, is a family of general $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$-orbit closures and their degenerations. We obtain a series of new results on $\mathbb{H}^{d, E_{\bullet}}$ and $\mathbb{F}^{d, E_\bullet}$.</description>

      <title>b-divisorial valuations and Berkovich positivity functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove semicontinuity properties for local positivity invariants of big and nef divisors.
  The usual definition of Seshadri constant and asymptotic order of vanishing along a subvariety is extended to include all seminorms in the Berkovich space, and
  we obtain semicontinuity of such constants as a function of the center seminorm.
  We use Shokurov's language of b-divisors; to each seminorm there is an associated b-divisor which can be used to translate questions about positivity into questions about the shape of certain cones of b-divisors.
  The theory works especially well for what we call b-divisorial valuations, a natural extension of the notion of divisorial valuations which encompasses, e.g., all Abhyankar valuations.</description>

      <title>Inequalities of Miyaoka-Yau type $\&amp;$ Uniformisation of varieties of intermediate Kodaira Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present, for any integers $0\leq \nu \leq n$, a set of inequalities satisfied by the Chern classes of any minimal complex projective variety of dimension $n$ and numerical dimension $\nu$. In the cases where $\nu$ is either very small or very large compared with $n$, this recovers many previously known results. We demonstrate that our inequalities are sharp by providing an explicit characterisation of those varieties achieving the equality; our proof, in particular, resolves the Abundance conjecture in this situation. Additionally, we provide some new examples of varieties with extremal Chern classes that demonstrate the optimality of our results.</description>

      <title>Integration of Hochschild cohomology, derived Picard groups and uniqueness of lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a partial integration map from the first Hochschild cohomology of any cohomologically unital A-infinity category over a field of characteristic zero to its derived Picard group. We discuss useful properties such as injectivity, naturality and the relation with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Based on the image of the integration map we propose a candidate for the identity component of the derived Picard group in the case of finite-dimensional graded algebras. As a first application of the integration map it is shown that the vanishing of its domain is a necessary condition for the uniqueness of lifts of equivalences from the homotopy category to the A-infinity-level. The final part contains applications to derived Picard groups of wrapped and compact Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and their plumbings and an outlook on applications to derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories after Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich.</description>

      <title>Center-freeness of finite-step solvable groups arising from anabelian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anabelian geometry suggests that, for suitably geometric objects, their \'etale fundamental groups determine the geometric objects up to isomorphism. From a group-theoretic viewpoint, this philosophy requires rigidity properties, which often follow from their center-freeness of the associated \'etale fundamental groups. In fact, some profinite groups arising from anabelian geometry are center-free. For any integer $m\geq 2$, we investigate how such center-freeness behaves under passage to the maximal $m$-step solvable quotients. In particular, we show that the maximal $m$-step solvable quotients of the \'etale and tame fundamental groups of a hyperbolic curve over a separably closed field are torsion-free and center-free. Furthermore, we show that this implies the rigidity property of the $m$-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture.</description>
