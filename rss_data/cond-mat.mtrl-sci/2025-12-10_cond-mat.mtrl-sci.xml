      <title>Magnetic properties of the Fe$_5$SiB$_2$-Fe$_5$PB$_2$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the compound Fe$_5$Si$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$B$_2$ have been studied, with a focus on the Curie temperature $T_\textrm{C}$, saturation magnetization $M_\textrm{S}$, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Field and temperature dependent magnetization measurements were used to determine $T_\textrm{C}\left(x\right)$ and $M_\textrm{S}\left(x\right)$. The saturation magnetization at 10 K (300 K) is found to monotonically decrease from $1.11~\mathrm{MA/m}$ ($1.03~\mathrm{MA/m}$) to $0.97~\mathrm{MA/m}$ ($0.87~\mathrm{MA/m}$), as $x$ increases from zero to one. The Curie temperature is determined to be 810 K and 615 K in Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ and Fe$_5$PB$_2$, respectively. The highest $T_\textrm{C}$ is observed for $x=0.1$, while it decreases monotonically for larger $x$. The Curie temperatures have also been theoretically determined to be 700 K and 660 K for Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ and Fe$_5$PB$_2$, respectively, using a combination of density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The magnitude of the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy was extracted using the law of approach to saturation, revealing an increase with increasing phosphorus concentration. Low--field magnetization vs. temperature results for $x = 0, 0.1, 0.2$ indicate that there is a transition from easy--axis to easy--plane anisotropy with decreasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced magnetoresistance in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of semiconducting properties and synthetically tunable chirality in chiral metal halide semiconductors (CMHS) offer a compelling platform for room temperature control over electronic spin properties, leveraging effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) for the development of new opto-spintronic functionalities. We report room-temperature CISS-induced magnetoresistance (CISS-MR) exceeding 100% for spin valves in a configuration consisting of a ferromagnet (FM), tunneling barrier, and CMHS. The high CISS-MR is attributed to interfacial spin-selective tunneling barrier induced by the chirality, which can produce current dissymmetry factors that surpass the limit imposed by the Julli\`ere model governed by the intrinsic spin polarization of the adjacent FM contact. The CISS-MR exhibits a strong dependence on the CMHS composition, revealing a structure-property relationship between CISS and structural chirality. The observed exceptionally large tunneling MR response differentiates from a subtle anisotropic MR arising from the proximity effect at the FM/CMHS interface in the absence of a tunneling barrier. Our study provides insights into charge-to-spin interconversion in chiral semiconductors, offering materials design principles to control and enhance CISS response and utilize it in functional platforms.</description>

      <title>Predicting interstitial elements in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys, composed of multiple principal refractory elements, are promising candidates for high-temperature structural applications due to their exceptional thermal stability and high melting points. However, their mechanical performance is often compromised by interstitial impurities, particularly oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, which segregate to grain boundaries and promote embrittlement. In this study, we investigate the solubility and thermodynamic behavior of oxygen interstitials in a model NbTiHfTa RCCA system. We synthesized NbTiHfTa alloys with varying oxygen contents via plasma arc melting and characterized their phase evolution and microstructure using XRD, SEM, and TEM. Complementary computational modeling was performed using machine-learning interatomic potentials integrated with Monte Carlo simulations to probe oxygen interactions at the atomic scale. Our results reveal a solubility limit for oxygen between 0.8 and 1.0 atomic percentage, beyond which HfO2 formation is energetically favorable. This combined experimental-computational framework provides a predictive approach for managing interstitial behavior in RCCAs, enabling improved alloy design strategies for enhanced mechanical performance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Co-Navigation of a Computational Physical Model and AFM Experiment to Autonomously Survey a Combinatorial Materials Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building autonomous experiment workflows requires transcending beyond the data-driven surrogate models to incorporate and dynamically refine physical theory during exploration. Here we demonstrate the first fully automated experimental realization of Bayesian co-navigation - a framework in which an autonomous agent simultaneously runs a physical experiment and a computationally expensive physical model. Using an automated AFM platform coupled to a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model of thin-film growth, the system infers a set of effective bond energies for the (CrTaWV)x-Mo(1-x) pseudo-binary combinatorial library, progressively adjusting the kMC parameters to decrease the epistemic disparity between simulation and experiment. This real-time theoretical refinement enables the kMC model to capture the behavior of the specific materials system and reveals the mechanistic role of hetero-bonding in governing surface diffusion. Together, these results establish co-navigation as a general strategy for tightly integrating physical models with autonomous experimental platforms to produce interpretable and continually self-correcting theoretical modelling of complex materials systems.</description>

      <title>Moire-Engineered Ferroelectric Transistors for Nearly Trap-free, Low-Power and Non-Volatile 2D Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range moire patterns in twisted WSe2 enable a built-in, moire-length-scale ferroelectric polarization that can be directly harnessed in electronic devices. Such a built-in ferroic landscape offers a compelling means to enable ultralow-voltage and non-volatile electronic functionality in two-dimensional materials; however, achieving stable polarization control without charge trapping has remained a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade). The device exhibits a stable non-volatile memory window of 0.10 V and high mobility, exceeding the performance of previously reported two-dimensional FeFET and matching that of advanced silicon-based devices. In addition, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy, corroborated by self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire modeling, indicates ultrafast ferroelectric switching (~0.5 microseconds). These results establish moire-engineered ferroelectricity as a practical and scalable route toward ultraclean, low-power, and non-volatile 2D electronics, bridging atomistic lattice engineering with functional device architectures for next-generation memory and logic technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hole Mobility in Monolayer $WSe_{2}$ p-FETs via Process-Induced Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between strain, interfacial mechanics, and electrical performance is critical for designing beyond silicon electronics based on hetero-integrated 2D materials. Through combined experiment and simulation, we demonstrated and analyzed the enhancement of hole mobility in p-type monolayer $WSe_{2}$ field effect transistors (FETs) under biaxial compression. We tracked FET performance versus strain by incrementing compressive strain to $WSe_{2}$ channels via sequential AlOx deposition and performing intermediate photoluminescence and transport measurements. The hole mobility factor increased at a rate of 340 $\pm$ 95 %/%$\epsilon$, and the on-current factor increased at a rate of 460 $\pm$ 340 %/%$\epsilon$. Simulation revealed that the enhancement under compression arises primarily from a reduction in inter-valley scattering between the $\Gamma$--K valence bands, and the rate is robust against variations in carrier density, impurity density, or dielectric environment. These findings show that compressive strain is a powerful technique for enhancing performance in 2D p-FETs and that it is multiplicative with defect and doping engineering.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of multiple topological orders in quasi-one-dimensional bismuth halide chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology is being widely adopted to understand and to categorize quantum matter in modern physics. The nexus of topology orders, which engenders distinct quantum phases with benefits to both fundamental research and practical applications for future quantum devices, can be driven by topological phase transition through modulating intrinsic or extrinsic ordering parameters. The conjoined topology, however, is still elusive in experiments due to the lack of suitable material platforms. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations to investigate the doping-driven band structure evolution of a quasi-one-dimensional material system, bismuth halide, which contains rare multiple band inversions in two time-reversal-invariant momenta. According to the unique bulk-boundary correspondence in topological matter, we unveil a composite topological phase, the coexistence of a strong topological phase and a high-order topological phase, evoked by the band inversion associated with topological phase transition in this system. Moreover, we reveal multiple-stage topological phase transitions by varying the halide element ratio: from high-order topology to weak topology, the unusual dual topology, and trivial/weak topology subsequently. Our results not only realize an ideal material platform with composite topology, but also provide an insightful pathway to establish abundant topological phases in the framework of band inversion theory.</description>

      <title>A Transcorrelated Wave-Function Framework for Solids: An Application to Bulk and Defected Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate wave-function descriptions of pristine and defected solids remain challenging due to the simultaneous presence of finite-size, basis-set, and correlation errors. While embedding techniques alleviate finite-size effects and correlated wave-function approaches systematically improve correlation, basis-set incompleteness continues to limit practical accuracy. Here we present a study of transcorrelated (TC) many-body wave-function methods on properties of solid state systems. We augment the existing xTC theory to periodic systems, and establish an unified transcorrelated embedding framework that integrates periodic TC theory with fragment-based correlated solvers. Using silicon as a test case, we validate the method against coupled-cluster, FCIQMC, and diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks for bulk. Then we apply TC embedding to calculation of formation energies of two silicon self-interstitials. The TC Hamiltonian yields rapid basis convergence and quantitatively reliable defect formation energies at the triple-$\zeta$ level, substantially reducing the basis-set bottleneck for wave-function treatments of crystalline defects.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast light-induced formation of a metastable hidden state in bismuth vanadate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BiVO$_4$) is a key photocatalyst for solar fuel applications, yet fundamental questions remain regarding the nature of photogenerated polaronic states and the lattice dynamics that govern its light-to-chemical pathways. Here, we use femtosecond optical pump-X-ray probe measurements to track the photoinduced electronic and structural dynamics in BiVO$_4$ across multiple length and time scales. Transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy captures sub-picosecond electron localization within VO$_4$ tetrahedra, consistent with small polaron formation, whereas time-resolved X-ray diffraction reveals a slower, multi-picosecond lattice reorganization into a hidden photoexcited state that is structurally distinct from both the monoclinic ground state and the high-temperature tetragonal phase. Supported by density functional theory, we show that hole-lattice interactions dynamically reduce the ground state monoclinic distortion, stabilizing the hidden state. Our results demonstrate that electron- and hole-lattice coupling jointly shape the excited state landscape, with implications for carrier transport, interfacial energetics, and light-to-chemical energy conversion pathways.</description>

      <title>Halogen Chains with One-Dimensional Semi-Metallic Electronic Structure and Peierls Physics in Polymorphs of Na4X5 (X = I, Br, Cl) Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the pioneering works of Peierls, one-dimensional materials have attracted great attention. Still, the synthesis of truly monoatomic chains remains elusive. In this study, we explore a novel path of experimental synthesis of monoatomic one-dimensional chains by their chemical stabilization in ionic compounds. We demonstrate that in synthesized at high pressure sodium halides Na4X5 (X = I, Br, Cl) with hP18 Ga4Ti5-type structures, transfer of valence electrons from cations to anions leads to the formation of halogen chains connected with other atoms only by ionic interaction and having one-dimensional electronic structure. The Peierls physics in the systems is confirmed by theoretical calculations, newly synthesized incommensurately modulated i-hP18-Na4X5 (X = I, Br, Cl) compounds, as well as by the discovered hP36 phases of Na4Cl5 and Na4Br5.</description>

      <title>Structural and Thermal Stability of B4C/Ru Multilayers with Carbon Barrier Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical interaction between Mo and Ru layers in multilayer structures depending on the thickness ratio ($\Gamma$) was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray reflectometry (XRR). The results showed significant interaction of materials inside multilayer structures with the formation of ruthenium borides, with an increase in the B4C layer thickness (a decrease in the $\Gamma$ parameter) leading to the formation of ruthenium borides of different stoichiometry. The introduction of a carbon barrier layer at the Ru-on-B4C interface resulted in significant suppression of ruthenium boride formation. The thermal stability of the B4C/Ru system was also studied upon annealing at 400$^{\circ}$C for 1 hour before and after the introduction of the carbon barrier layer. It was shown that the introduction of a carbon barrier layer at the Ru-on-B4C interface increases the thermal stability of the system, which makes this system more suitable for use in optical systems exposed to long-term radiation. The obtained results are important for the development of highly efficient multilayer mirrors used in EUV lithography and X-ray optics.</description>

      <title>Disorder-mediated linear and nonlinear magnetotransport in the charge-density-wave material ${\rm Ta_2NiSe_7 }$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report disorder-mediated first-order linear and higher-order nonlinear (magneto-)transport of Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ (TNS) in the charge-density-wave (CDW) regime. CDW transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and carrier density are proportional and inversely proportional to residual resistance ratio of samples, respectively. Such relation helps to understand the unique CDW order therein. High-$T_{CDW}$ TNS exhibits negative first-harmonic magnetoresistance (MR$^{1\omega}$) under a magnetic field ($B$) parallel to the direction of alternating current ($I^{\omega}$), which may arise from the anomalous velocity induced by the Berry curvature of three-dimensional topological bands near the Fermi level. As $T_{CDW}$ drops, a positive-to-negative MR$^{1\omega}$ transition is observed with decreasing perpendicular $B$, which is likely due to the contribution of Zeeman effect on current pathways in the disordered system. Moreover, interestingly, the second-harmonic nonlinear signals are suppressed, while the third-harmonic signals are significant and sensitive to both $B$ and $T_{CDW}$. Such observations, together with scaling analysis, suggest the quantum geometry quadrupole at play and the modulation of disorder on third-order nonlinearity. Our results pave an avenue for tailoring distinct-order magnetoresistive phases in disordered topological materials.</description>

      <title>Chiral-phonon generation of orbital currents in light transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum offers a new channel for information transport in a vast set of materials. Its coherent generation and detection remain, however, largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generate sizable orbital currents in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers through both the acoustic orbital Hall effect and acoustic orbital pumping. Using symmetry analysis of SAW-driven voltages, we disentangle vorticity-sensitive orbital currents arising from lattice rotation in the non-magnetic layer from angular-momentum pumping from the ferromagnet. Strong signals are observed only in nickel/chromium and nickel/titanium, while nickel/aluminum and all cobalt-based bilayers show negligible responses, revealing the critical roles of orbital Hall conductivity, phonon-orbital coupling, and interfacial orbital transparency. Comparison with spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and second-harmonic measurements -- where electrically driven orbital angular momentum are weaker -- demonstrates that phonon excitation generates orbital currents more efficiently. These results establish chiral SAWs as an effective route for orbitronic functionality and open pathways toward phonon-controlled orbital magnetism.</description>

      <title>The unexpected dewetting during growth of silicene flakes with dendritic pyramids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicene growth on graphene has emerged as a novel method for fabricating silicon-based van der Waals heterostructures. However, the silicene flakes produced in this manner are the result of an exotic growth mode characterized by metastable nanostructures with varying degrees of deviation from equilibrium, with large two-dimensional flakes surrounded by a rim that coexist with small 3D islands, and, at large deposits, thick dendritic pyramids separated by a denuded zone. In order to rationalize and control this growth, a model is derived that revisits the dewetting thermodynamics and considers generally ignored adsorption and step-edge energies. The model is investigated using kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and mean-field rate equations, and implemented by close inspection of microscopy images. This model perfectly reproduces the experimental outcomes, unveiling an anomalous growth mode, and provides guidelines on experimental conditions for high-quality silicene growth.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effects of Slip, Twinning, and Notch on the Deformation of Single-Crystal Austenitic Manganese Steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to deconvolute the interaction of slip, twinning, and notch on the deformation response of an austenitic manganese (Hadfield) steel using detailed finite element simulations. The simulations employ a rate-dependent crystal plasticity constitutive model that incorporates both slip and twinning deformation mechanisms. The model accounts for the spatially non-uniform appearance of new twin-related orientations, hardening due to slip--twin interactions, and modified properties of the twinned crystal. Limited experiments on single-crystal dog-bone and single-edge notch specimens, with two crystal orientations, are also conducted to aid the simulation. Several features of the experimental observations are accurately captured in the simulations. For example, simulations accurately capture distinct stress--strain responses associated with different crystallographic orientations, including variations in initial hardening behavior followed by either decreasing or increasing hardening depending on the dominant deformation mechanisms. The simulation also captures the observed orientation-dependent asymmetric deformation of the notch in single-edge notch specimens. Additionally, by selectively activating deformation mechanisms, the role of twinning is isolated and its influence on both global and local response is clearly demonstrated. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how deformation mode interactions and local geometry (i.e., notch) influence the response of these materials.</description>

      <title>Synthesis, Growth Mechanism, and Photocatalytic Properties of Metallic-Bi/Bi13S18Br2 Nano-Bell Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of bell-shaped Bi/Bi13S18Br2 metal/semiconductor heterostructures as a photocatalyst based on non-toxic and Earth-abundant elements. Their unique morphology arises from a multi-step growth process, involving 1) the nucleation of Bi13S18Br2 nanorods, 2) the reduction of a metallic-Bi domain on their surface induced by N,N-didodecylmethylamine, and 3) the heterostructure accretion by a localized reaction at the Bi/Bi13S18Br2 interface promoted by Ostwald ripening. These heterostructures display remarkable stability in polar solvents, remaining almost unaffected by prolonged exposure to isopropanol and water, and exhibit high photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of organic dyes (i.e., Rhodamine-B and Methylene Blue) under visible-light irradiation, with good recyclability. Additionally, preliminary tests demonstrate CO2 reduction capabilities, which make them promising for both the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and photo-electro CO2 conversion. The straightforward synthesis process and the use of non-toxic and earth-abundant elements offers significant potential for sustainable energy conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking First-Principles Approaches for Extracting Magnetic Exchange Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic exchange interactions govern the macroscopic magnetic behavior of solids and underpin both fundamental spin phenomena and emerging technologies. The accurate and efficient determination of these interactions is therefore critical for predictive modeling of magnetic materials. Here we present a systematic first-principles comparison of three widely used approaches-the Least-Squares Total Energy (LSTE), the Four-State Total Energy (FSTE), and the Green's function-based Liechtenstein \textit{et al.} (LKAG) methods-applied to thirteen antiferromagnetic compounds. We introduce an framework for identifying the minimal supercells required for an accurate exchange parameter extraction in the FSTE method, significantly reducing computational cost while preserving precision. Our results show that LSTE and FSTE yield nearly identical exchange parameters, whereas the LKAG method reproduces the dominant exchange interactions but exhibits quantitative deviations. A detailed analysis of computational efficiency versus accuracy reveals that the LSTE scheme offers the most favorable balance, establishing a general, reproducible, and scalable workflow for Heisenberg mapping, while the FSTE approach remains the most straightforward for extracting specific exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Core@Shell AgBr@CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals as Precursors to Hollow Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of colloidal core@shell AgBr@CsPbBr3 nanocubes by a one-pot approach, where the nucleation and growth of AgBr nanocrystals occurs rapidly after the injection of chemical precursors. This is immediately followed by the overgrowth of CsPbBr3, delivering AgBr@CsPbBr3 nanocubes of several tens of nanometers in size, with the volume of the AgBr core being only a small fraction of the overall nanocrystal volume. The formation of a core@shell geometry is facilitated by the epitaxial compatibility between AgBr and CsPbBr3 along multiple crystallographic directions. Exchange with Cl-ions leads to Ag@CsPbCl3 nanocubes, whereas exchange with I-ions leads to hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes, due to selective etching of the AgBr (or Ag) core region by the I-ions diffusing in the nanocubes. These hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes can then be converted into hollow CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 nanocubes by halide exchange. The optical emission properties of the hollow CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocubes are in line with those expected from large, non-hollow halide perovskite nanocrystals, indicating that the small hollow region in the cubes has no major influence on their optical properties.</description>

      <title>Exogenous Metal Cations in the Synthesis of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals and their Interplay with Tertiary Amines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current syntheses of CsPbBr3 halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) rely on over-stoichiometric amounts of Pb2+ precursors, resulting in unreacted lead ions at the end of the process. In our synthesis scheme of CsPbBr3 NCs we replaced excess Pb2+ with different exogenous metal cations (M) and investigated their effect on the synthesis products. These cations can be divided into two groups: group 1 delivers monodisperse CsPbBr3 cubes capped with oleate species (as for the case when Pb2+ is used in excess) and with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 90% with some cations (for example with M= In3+); group 2 yields irregularly shaped CsPbBr3 NCs with broad size distributions. In both cases, the addition of a tertiary ammonium cation (didodecylmethyl ammonium, DDMA+) during the synthesis, after the nucleation of the NCs, reshapes the NCs to monodisperse truncated cubes. Such NCs feature a mixed oleate/DDMA+ surface termination with PLQY values up to 90%. For group 1 cations, this happens only if the ammonium cation is directly added as a salt (DDMA-Br) while for group 2 cations this happens even if the corresponding tertiary amine (DDMA) is added, instead of DDMA-Br. This is attributed to the fact that only group 2 cations can facilitate the protonation of DDMA by the excess oleic acid present in the reaction environment. In all cases studied, the incorporation of M cations is marginal and the reshaping of the NCs is only transient: if the reactions are run for a long time the truncated cubes evolve to cubes.</description>

Abstract: The present investigation reports on the fabrication and characterization of heterojunctions based on in situ Eu doped CdO layers, which were deposited on p-type silicon using the plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA MBE) method. The structural and optical properties of the cadmium oxide (CdO) films were investigated using X ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The CdO Eu films are polycrystalline. The electrical properties of the p n heterojunction composed of transparent n CdO Eu and p Si semiconductors were investigated by current voltage and electron beam-induced current (EBIC) measurements. Current voltage measurements demonstrate good junction characteristics with a rectifying ratio of 20 . EBIC measurements allowed us to calculate the diffusion length of minority carriers and the precise location of the depleted area at the CdO and Si interfaces.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Photocarrier and Phonon Dynamics from First Principles: a Unified Treatment of Carrier-Carrier, Carrier-Phonon, and Phonon-Phonon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles many-body framework to describe the dynamics of photocarriers and phonons in semiconductors following ultrafast excitation. Our approach incorporates explicit ab initio light-matter coupling and first-principles collision integrals for carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering. It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments. The method can be coupled to constrained density-functional theory to access light-induced structural phase transitions at longer times after the light pulse. We showcase the capabilities and predictive power of this framework on MoS$_2$ and h-BN monolayers. For MoS$_2$, we resolve photoinduced renormalizations of electronic and lattice properties, ultrafast carrier relaxation, hot-phonon dynamics, and displacive coherent atomic motion. Including carrier-carrier scattering is crucial to obtain realistic photocarrier equilibration times, while omitting phonon-phonon scattering leads to incorrect long-time lattice thermalization and a factor of two larger A$_{1g}$ coherent phonon damping time. For h-BN, we quantify photoinduced changes in the electronic, optical, and lattice responses in quasi-equilibrium, demonstrating a fluence-dependent enhancement of screening and melting of excitonic features.</description>

      <title>Observation of Raman anomaly and characterization of magnetic phases in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ has garnered significant interest due to its high Curie temperature (T$_C$), large saturation magnetization, and complex magnetic behavior arising, in part, from multiple inequivalent iron sites and vacancies. While several aspects of its complex magnetic and structural characteristics have been examined through careful experiments and first principles studies, much of it remains debatable. In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive temperature-dependent Raman spectrum for bulk Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ and in the process reveal an interesting peak shift anomaly at 150 K. We discuss the possible relationship of this Raman anomaly with the anomalous lattice expansion reported earlier for this material at around 110 K. The impact of the anomalous lattice expansion on the magnetic anisotropy in this van der Waals material is also revealed by an isothermal magnetization analysis. These findings will prove crucial for the use of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ in high-performance spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) opens opportunities to engineer topological electronic phases, including topological insulators (TIs) and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs)--materials that host in-gap states localized at their edges, hinges, or corners. Here we explore how chemically feasible perturbations can drive triazine-based COFs (CTFs) into topological regimes. Using a tight-binding model on the Honeycomb lattice inspired by the frontier electronic states of CTFs, we show that introducing an effective uniaxial strain--implemented as a modulation of electron hopping on a subset of bonds--can generate a series of distinct topological band structures. This effect can be realized in practice through chemical substitution of linkers along the strained bonds. First-principles calculations demonstrate that replacing biphenyl with pyrene linkers drives a CTF to the brink of a HOTI phase, suggesting a viable route toward topological band-structure engineering in COFs.</description>

      <title>Computational Screening and Discovery of Silver-Indium Halide Double Salts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite-inspired materials have emerged as promising candidates for both outdoor and indoor photovoltaic applications owing to their favorable optoelectronic properties and reduced toxicity. Here, we employ the experimentally realized AgBiI$_4$ double salt as a structural prototype and replace Bi$^{3+}$ with In$^{3+}$ to design a novel lead-free halide compound, AgInI$_4$. First-principles calculations predict that AgInI$_4$ is both chemically and dynamically stable, exhibiting a direct band gap of 1.72 eV, comparable to its bismuth analogue. However, its predicted photovoltaic performance, evaluated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency metric, is lower under both solar and LED illumination. This reduction arises primarily from symmetry-forbidden optical transitions and the absence of Bi-derived 6s$^2$ lone-pair states at the valence band maximum. High-throughput screening of the Ag-In-I ternary phase-space reveals several more stable and metastable compounds that fall into two structural families: tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated, with characteristic band gaps near 3.0 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Despite multiple synthetic attempts, the predicted AgInI$_4$ phase could not be experimentally realized, underscoring the challenges of stabilizing indium-based halide double salts. While these materials are unlikely to serve as efficient photovoltaic absorbers, their tunable band gaps and stability make them promising candidates for charge transport and other optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Bilayers Hybridized with Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanosheets for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have attracted attention as a promising and cost-effective alternative catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their aggregation and poor conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to improve the conductivity and density of electroactive edges of MoS2 through hybridization with akin advanced 2D materials. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are added to a liquid-phase-exfoliated MoS2 dispersion to create drop-casting hybrid MoS2@rGO electrodes for HER. The findings reveal the formation of ~1.1 nm-thick MoS2 bilayers, with the catalytic performance of MoS2@rGO dependent on the degree of graphene oxide reduction. The rGO moderate reduction prevents the MoS2 bilayers from restacking, improves conductivity, retains oxygenated groups that enhance interlayer spacing, and exposes more electroactive edges. When hybridized with rGO crafted at optimal reduction time, the hybrid system eclipses the efficiency of pristine MoS2 bilayers by attaining the lowest overpotential (~70 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (~46 mV dec-1). This shows that MoS2 bilayers hybridized with rGO offer a promising method to outperform the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2-based electrodes. These findings expand opportunities for future strain engineering, defect engineering, and high-end twist-angle assemblies for hybrid systems combining MoS2 bilayers and rGO.</description>

While the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional systematically overestimates lattice parameters and strongly underestimates electronic band gaps, hybrid functionals such as Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) offer better overall agreement across a broad range of materials. Using germanium as a critical test case, we challenge the ability of both functionals to capture semiconductor properties. Although HSE improves PBE's gap error, it fails to reproduce germanium's correct $\Gamma$-L indirect and $\Gamma$-$\Gamma$ band gaps simultaneously. Noting that the PBE underestimated energy separation between the 4p valence-band maximum and 4s conduction-band minimum causes unphysical $sp$ mixing, we propose DFT+$\alpha$, a semi-empirical correction scheme applied selectively to 4s-like orbitals. For germanium, DFT+$\alpha$ restores the proper ordering and orbital character of the band edges and yields accurate lattice constant, bulk modulus, elastic constants and phonon frequencies at a fraction of hybrid-functional computational cost.</description>

      <title>Low Resistance Non-Alloyed Ohmic Contacts to High Al Composition n-type AlGaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ohmic contacts to high (&gt;70\%) Al content n-type Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor layers in nitride electronic and photonic devices are typically fabricated by a lift-off process and high temperature ($&gt;700^\circ$C) thermal alloying. These conditions often result in significant structural deformations of the fabricated structures and impose a harsh thermal budget on all other aspects of the device. Here, we report the fabrication of \textit{non-alloyed} \textit{as-deposited} ohmic contacts to 71\% n+AlGaN ($E_\text{g}\sim5.4$~eV) with a free carrier concentration of roughly $7\times 10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and a resistivity of 4 - 5.5 m$\Omega$cm (among the lowest reported for Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N) with linear $I-V$ characteristics and a contact resistivity of $\rho_\text{c}=(4.4\pm1.0)\times10^{-4}$~$\Omega$cm$^2$ (measured at zero voltage). Contacts with this quality are formed by two separate fabrication schemes: (i) metal-first patterning, and (ii) lift-off with an oxygen asher descum prior to metal deposition. Given the low threading dislocation density in the single-crystal AlN substrate used for epitaxy, the smooth morphology of the contacted epitaxial surface, and the non-alloyed nature of the contacts, this contact resistivity is attributed purely to thermionic field emission through the metal-semiconductor junction. Contact resistivity extraction at low current injection enables us to model these results using a thermionic field-emission model of contact resistivity, yielding a barrier height for Ti/Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N of $(0.81\pm0.02)$ eV.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders via Spin Space Groups: Prediction of Coplanar Even-Wave Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin space groups (SSGs) impose fundamentally different constraints on magnetic configurations in real and reciprocal spaces. As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>The effects of H blistering and ELMs on the thermal fatigue cracking of W by strikepoint sweeping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic thermal loads imposed on a W divertor by strikepoint sweeping may induce low-cycle thermal fatigue cracking of its plasma-facing surfaces. This cracking may be accelerated by plasma-material interactions such as H implantation, blistering, fuzz and void formation. Fatigue cracking may also synergise with ELM cracking. To explore these novel forms of environmentally assisted fatigue, FEA modelling was used to design a uniaxial fatigue experiment for Magnum-PSI that represents strikepoint sweeping at 1 Hz across a 100 mm span of a divertor target. Magnum-PSI was used to combine cyclic thermal loading of W with H implantation and two forms of ELM like pre-cracking. Quantitative SEM analysis of fatigue-cracked W revealed that H implantation significantly delayed crack initiation, with preimplanted targets requiring 450-600 cycles before failure compared to 150 cycles for non-implanted samples. This was attributed to hydrogen-induced dislocation pinning, which produces a case-hardening effect that inhibits persistent slip band formation. ELM-like pre-cracking combined with strikepoint sweeping was found to give rise to localised melting and the formation of 30 micromete diameter droplets, caused by thermal isolation of W regions by fatigue cracks. The implications for the fatigue lifetime of tokamak divertors are also discussed.</description>

      <title>F2: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Hamiltonian Simulation via Free-Fermionic Subroutine Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08023v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction.
  We introduce F2, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data.
  Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47% and depth by 38% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of 10^(-7). These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation</description>

      <title>Coherent and compact van der Waals transmon qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art superconducting qubits rely on a limited set of thin-film materials. Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Missing Wedge Inpainting and Joint Alignment in Electron Tomography through Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron tomography is a powerful tool for understanding the morphology of materials in three dimensions, but conventional reconstruction algorithms typically suffer from missing-wedge artifacts and data misalignment imposed by experimental constraints. Recently proposed supervised machine-learning-enabled reconstruction methods to address these challenges rely on training data and are therefore difficult to generalize across materials systems. We propose a fully self-supervised implicit neural representation (INR) approach using a neural network as a regularizer. Our approach enables fast inline alignment through pose optimization, missing wedge inpainting, and denoising of low dose datasets via model regularization using only a single dataset. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data and show that it produces high-quality tomograms from diverse and information limited datasets. Our results show that INR-based self-supervised reconstructions offer high fidelity reconstructions with minimal user input and preprocessing, and can be readily applied to a wide variety of materials samples and experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Field manipulation of Weyl modes in an ideal Dirac semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent Weyl modes with the broken time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry provide large Berry curvature and chirality to carriers, offering the realistic platforms to explore topology of electrons in three-dimensional systems. However, the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is of particular interest in the fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential application in spintronics, is scarcely achieved due to restriction of inborn symmetry in crystals. Here, by tuning the direction and strength of magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, we report the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode by the magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations. Specifically, under a magnetic field with broken mirror symmetry, anomalous Hall effect with step feature results from the large Berry curvature for the gapped Weyl mode. A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively. Our findings reveal distinct Weyl modes under the intertwined crystal symmetry and time-reversal breaking, laying the foundation of manipulating multiple Weyl modes in chiral spintronic network.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity tensor dynamics of in-plane hyperbolic van der Waals MoOCl2 and emergent chiral photonic applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) crystals offer unique opportunities for modern nanophotonic applications owing to their intrinsic anisotropic nature. While most of them exhibit uniaxial anisotropy arising from weak out-of-plane vdW interaction, some of their representative families also exhibit an in-plane biaxial anisotropy. Among the latter, outstand vdW oxochlorides with in-plane axes of a different physical character (metallic or dielectric). Here, we present an accurate dynamics of dielectric permittivity tensor components of vdW MoOCl2 in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (Vis) spectral region partly covering near-infrared (NIR). Addressing its enormously anisotropic optical constants, we focus on another hyperbolicity window of vdW MoOCl2 emerging in the UV spectral region that may potentially unlock rich light-matter interaction effects. Furthermore, we propose an approach towards designing nanoscale handedness preserved Vis light circular polarizers based on twisted helical vdW MoOCl2 heterostructures. Our findings display that vdW MoOCl2 provides a highly promising platform not only for hyperbolic, but also for chiral nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle X-ray Scattering Reveals a High Local Supersaturation of Precursors as the Origin of CoO Assembly Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle small-angle X-ray scattering (SP-SAXS) enables quantitative morphological analysis by recording diffraction snapshots from isolated particles using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses. Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, which average over the entire illuminated sample volume, SP-SAXS resolves low-contrast, less abundant, or transient species within heterogeneous particle populations that would otherwise remain hidden. Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes.</description>

      <title>Reducing dislocation defect levels via sub-melt nanosecond pulsed-laser induced densification of diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocations and polishing-induced defect networks in synthetic diamond generate local strain fields that broaden Raman features and limit optical, thermal, and electronic performance. Sub-melt laser annealing has emerged as a route to repair near-surface defects without graphitization, yet quantitative evidence of densification, defect depletion, and property recovery remains limited. Here, we show that nanosecond pulsed-laser annealing (PLA) can relax dislocation-associated strain in single-crystal CVD diamond by compacting and reorganizing the damaged near-surface region. Single- and two-pulse PLA were applied, and structural evolution was quantified using co-registered ISO 25178 white-light interferometry, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and cross-sectional STEM with geometric phase analysis (GPA). Across a 5x6 grid(n = 30), responsive regions show large reductions in local slope (Sdq 45-65%), developed area (Sdr 60-90%), height spread (Sp, Sz 30-65%), void volume (Vv 57-60%), and roughness amplitude (Sa, Sq 48-57%), consistent with densification of ~4-6.5 nm. Raman profiling reveals narrowing of the diamond line and improved spectral uniformity to depths of ~2-3 {\mu}m, indicating relaxation of dislocation-mediated strain beyond the compaction layer. STEM-GPA strain maps confirm smoother strain fields, reduced hotspots, and redistribution of localized strain concentrations after PLA. These results show that sub-melt PLA reduces dislocation-driven strain by compacting surface-connected free volume and reorganizing defect networks. The approach provides a scalable path to upgrade industrial-grade diamond including homoepitaxial, heteroepitaxial, and polycrystalline CVD to low-defect, device-ready surfaces relevant to high-power electronics, photonics, and quantum substrates.</description>

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide with metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) that is triggered by heat, current or light is a promising material for modern active THz/mid-IR metasurfaces and all-optical big data processing systems. Multilayer VO2-based active metasurfaces are urgently needed however several important issues related to VO2 properties in VO2/TiO2/Al2O3 films should be thoroughly examined first. We study electrical, optical and structural properties of VO2 films as well as their composition and switching characteristics as function of the VO2 layer thickness in VO2/TiO2 composites. XRD analysis revealed an epitaxial growth of films with deformation of the monoclinic VO2 lattice to hexagonal symmetry. Reduced VO2 layer thickness from 170 nm to 20 nm results in increased phase transition temperature while the width of the resistance versus temperature hysteresis loop R(T) remains constant at ~6C for all VO2 thicknesses in the range of 20-170 nm. The resistance alteration ratio is reduced from 4.2e3 to 2.7e2 in thinner films. Raman spectra reveal a significant shift of VO2 lattice vibration modes for films thinner than 30 nm claiming a great structural strain whereas modes position for thicker VO2 layers are similar to those in bulk structure. Composition of VO2 films has revealed only a minor alteration of VO2/V2O5 phases ratio from 1.6 to 1.8 when the film thickness has been increased from 20 nm to 50 nm. Investigation of surface elemental composition and valence states of VO2 films revealed that VO2/V2O5 ratio remains practically unchanged with thickness reduction. The study of electrical MIT dynamics revealed the switching time of a 50 nm VO2 film to be as low as 800 ns.</description>

      <title>Unravelling magnetic vortex-like excitations through rapid thermal quenching in low-carbon steel</title>

Abstract: Steel, traditionally valued for its structural strength, emerges in this study as a remarkable material for exploring novel magnetic phenomena. We investigate how common processing techniques-thermal treatments and mechanical strain-significantly affect the magnetic properties of low-carbon steels (0.05 percent by weight). Our findings show that slow annealing enlarges the grain size, enhancing magnetic susceptibility, while rapid quenching reduces grain size, resulting in a decreased magnetic response. Quenching low-carbon steel produces significant increase in the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries and a rapid spatial variation of local magnetic anisotropy between grains, a feature which is unachievable with mechanical straining even up to the material's ultimate tensile strength. Tensile-straining of low-carbon steel enhances magnetic susceptibility through altered magnetic anisotropy, contrary to the observed decrease of susceptibility in quenched low-carbon steel. Magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic modelling of our data reveal that, the reduced magnetic susceptibility in quenched steel is a result of the presence of intriguing magnetic excitations akin to magnetic vortices. These localized structures act as strong magnetic domain wall pinning centres, causing the observed decrease in magnetic susceptibility in these quenched low-carbon steels. Beyond its established structural utility, low-carbon steel combines mechanical stability with favourable magnetic properties, positioning it as a strong platform for magnetic device applications.</description>

      <title>An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated MD method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated MD simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its capability to accelerate MD simulations by several orders of magnitude while maintaining kinetic consistency and good accuracy in predicting long timescale microstructure evolutions of materials. We also provide some preliminary thoughts on theoretical justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, 2D materials pose a special challenge, as all 2D materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.</description>

      <title>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>Automated Construction of Artificial Lattice Structures with Designer Electronic States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. Using our approach, we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact heat flux formula and its spectral decomposition in molecular dynamics for arbitrary many-body potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we have derived an exact framework for the calculation of the heat flux and its spectral decomposition in Molecular Dynamics (MD) for arbitrary many-body potentials. This work addresses several lacks and limitations of previous approaches and allows for the accurate computational study of thermal properties in a wide variety of many-body systems with MD. We have tested our modifications with Green-Kubo (GK) and Non-Equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations for various 2D and 3D material systems using the Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber potentials as examples. The spectral decomposition of the heat current was also calculated for monolayer graphene (1LG) and MoS2 , for different system lengths. Our results show that the heat current calculated by our method is consistently in agreement with the thermostat current in NEMD, while previous implementations can estimate quite poorly the thermal conductivity both under GK and NEMD simulations, and both for 2D and 3D materials. The decomposition of the heat current also sheds light on the contribution of different phonon modes to thermal conductivity and its dependence on length. Our methodology is implemented in the widely used LAMMPS code specifically for the Tersoff and SW potentials, and it is readily applicable to the vast majority of many-body MD potentials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of proton insertion across the perovskite-brownmillerite transition in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-{\delta}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO3-$\delta$ is a promising off-stoichiometric metal oxide that undergoes a topotactic perovskite ($\delta$ = 0) to brownmillerite ($\delta$ = 0.5) transition under electrochemical and thermochemical stimuli, with concomitant variations in its electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties. Recent studies on thin-film cycling in electrochemical devices show incomplete reversibility of this transition, with significant acid-etching serving as a degradation mechanism. While earlier investigations examined the protonation of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5, the thermodynamics of protonation across the perovskite-to-brownmillerite transition remain poorly understood. In this work, we combine density functional theory calculations with predictions from universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to elucidate the energetics and implications of protonation across the transition for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$. These calculations reveal negative hydrogen insertion energies and strong competition with oxygen vacancy formation across the transition for a wide range of conditions. The extent of protonation is primarily limited by the availability of Co 3d states to accommodate reduction by inserted hydrogen. Although hydrogen insertion is often thermodynamically favorable within a defect picture, a convex hull analysis of the resulting HyLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ phases reveals them to be unstable against decomposition into hydroxides among other products. This instability increases with hydrogen content and provides a thermodynamic basis for the acid-etching observed during electrochemical cycling. This work advances the fundamental understanding of protonation in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ and contextualizes experimental observations of related materials in the presence of moisture or H2.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Generation of Special Quasirandom Structures with ATAT Using Interactive Online Interface -- SimplySQS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is a widely used approach for modeling random alloys with periodic boundary conditions. Among available implementations, the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) mcsqs module remains one of the most established tools for SQS generation. However, its command-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep learning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming experience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS (simplysqs.com), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates the preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS allows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD), configure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate ATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence behavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best SQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By simplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens access to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners while streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated on the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to obtain SQSs across the composition range. The resulting structures were subsequently optimized using the MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0 universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to predict evolution of lattice parameters. The MLIP accurately reproduced the cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic (x &gt; 0.5) and 3 % in the tetragonal (x &lt; 0.5) regions.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Glass-Forming Ability in Ternary Alloy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the glass-forming ability (GFA) of chemical compositions remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for oxide glasses with broad compositional diversity. Traditional empirical and thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear factors governing vitrification. In this study, we applied two ensemble machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-to the glass_ternary_hipt dataset to predict the GFA of ternary oxide glasses directly from composition-derived descriptors. Both models achieved excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 &gt; 0.92, MAE &lt; 0.04), confirming that GFA is learnable from compositional features alone. Feature importance analysis revealed that electronegativity variance, atomic size mismatch, and valence electron descriptors are the most influential factors, while cohesive energy and ionic radius provided secondary contributions. These chemically interpretable features align with established theories of glass formation, thereby bridging predictive performance with physical understanding. The novelty of this work lies in systematically extending ML-based predictive modeling to ternary oxide glasses, a class less studied compared to metallic and binary systems. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning not only enables accurate GFA prediction but also provides actionable insights for designing new glass compositions with enhanced stability.</description>

Abstract: Antiperovskite nitrides with the general formula M$_3$N have attracted significant attention due to their tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Among them are many cobalt-based compounds predicted to exhibit high thermodynamic stability and intriguing magnetic behavior. Here, we report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN thin films grown by radio frequency sputtering on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and MgO substrates. X-ray diffraction confirms phase-pure (00l)-oriented films with cube-on-cube epitaxy on STO, with a c-lattice parameter of 3.752 angstroms. Magnetic measurements reveal clear hysteresis at 2 K with a coercive field of ~ 0.12 T and a small net moment of 0.11 ${\mu}_B$/f.u., suggesting either a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) configuration. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show a transition near 25 K, with strong AFM interactions (Curie-Weiss $\Theta$ = -80.6 K) at high temperatures and short-range ferromagnetic correlations ($\Theta$ = +9.7 K) emerging near the transition. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations indicate a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, with the FM-AFM energy difference decreasing systematically with increasing supercell size, consistent with competition between FM and AFM/FiM interactions. These results highlight Co$_3$ZnN as a magnetically complex antiperovskite nitride with competing exchange interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum and resulting magnetic moment can couple to magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of phonons in collinear magnets, spanning ferro-, antiferro-, and alter-magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types of magnetic phonons based on symmetry and PAM wave-pattern parity. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from $p$- to $j$-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such alteraxial phonons. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Tensor Trains for accelerated Quantum-Inspired Homogenization on TPU, GPU and CPU architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in high-resolution CT-imaging technology are creating a new class of ultra-high resolved micro-structural datasets that challenge the limits of traditional homogenization approaches. While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets in the presence of crystalline lattice dislocations are investigated. We show the existence of topologically protected non-propagative modes that localize at dislocations. These in-gap states, coined as {\it magnonic dislocation modes}, are characterized by the $Z_2$ topological invariant that derives from parity symmetry broken induced by sublattice magnetic anisotropy. We uncover that bulk topology existing in the perfect crystal is robust under the influence of lattice defects, which is monitored by the real-space Bott index. It is also revealed that the topology of {magnonic dislocation modes} remains unaffected when bulk topology becomes trivial and is remarkably resilient against magnetic disorder. Our findings point to the intriguing relationship between topological lattice defects and the spectrum of topological spin excitations.</description>

This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations, assuming a rigid, perfectly plastic material and exploiting the thinness of the wire (in thickness and width) relative to the roller size. Results are compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using 100mm diameter rolls, demonstrating accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. Since the model requires only seconds to compute, the model's valid range is explored for varying roll diameter, wire diameter, and reduction ratio, and their effects on the resulting lateral spread characterized. The model can serve as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models. Matlab code to evaluate the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Localized Triplons and Site Stuffing in the Quantum Dimer Magnet BiYbGeO$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic and muon spin-relaxation measurements have recently highlighted BiYbGeO$_5$ as a new example of a rare-earth-based quantum dimer magnet with isolated Yb$^{3+}$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dimers. However, direct spectroscopic evidence of the triplet excitations and measurements of the structural disorder are lacking. In this work, polycrystalline BiYbGeO$_5$ was synthesized using conventional high-temperature solid-state methods and investigated via high-resolution neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. Diffraction measurements down to 58 mK reveal no signatures of magnetic order and indicate that nearly 20\% of Yb$^{3+}$ sites are replaced by non-magnetic Bi$^{3+}$, introducing significant structural disorder. Inelastic neutron scattering shows dispersionless triplon excitations, consistent with localized, non-interacting spin dimers. Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z = 0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered but magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform for studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.</description>
