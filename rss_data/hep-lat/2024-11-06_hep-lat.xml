      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the subtraction function in forward Compton amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subtraction function plays a pivotal role in calculations involving the forward Compton amplitude, which is crucial for predicting the Lamb shift in muonic atom, as well as the proton-neutron mass difference. In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the subtraction function using two domain wall fermion gauge ensembles at the physical pion mass. We utilize a recently proposed subtraction point, demonstrating its advantage in mitigating statistical and systematic uncertainties by eliminating the need for ground-state subtraction. Our results reveal significant contributions from $N\pi$ intermediate states to the subtraction function. Incorporating these contributions, we compute the proton, neutron and nucleon isovector subtraction functions at photon momentum transfer $Q^2\in[0,2]$ GeV$^2$. For the proton subtraction function, we compare our lattice results with chiral perturbation theory prediction at low $Q^2$ and with the results from the perturbative operator-product expansion at high $Q^2$. Finally, using these subtraction functions as input, we determine their contribution to two-photon exchange effects in the Lamb shift and isovector nucleon electromagnetic self-energy.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Two lectures on Yang-Lee edge singularity and analytic structure of QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes, prepared for the 2024 XQCD PhD, provide an introduction to the analytic structure of an equation of state near a second-order phase transition and its most prominent landmark: the Yang-Lee edge singularity. In addition to discussing general properties, the notes review recent theoretical progress in locating the QCD critical point by tracking the trajectory of the Yang-Lee edge singularity.</description>

      <title>Sketch of the resolution of the axial U(1) problem without chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism which explains the masses of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons without invoking the explicit violation of $U(1)_A$ symmetry by the chiral anomaly. It is shown that the U(1) problem, the problem for which the prediction of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ masses in the simple chiral perturbation theory largely deviates from the experimental values, is actually resolved by considering the first order contribution of the disconnected meson correlator with respect to the quark mass. The bound of Weinberg $m_\eta^2 \le 3 m_\pi^2$ is fulfilled by considering the negative squared mass of $\eta$ or $\eta'$ which is just the saddle point of the QCD effective potential, and 20% level agreements with experimental data are obtained by just fitting one low energy constant. We provide the leading chiral Lagrangian due to the disconnected contribution in 3-flavor QCD, and also discuss the 2- and 4-flavor cases as well as the consistency of our mechanism with the chiral restoration at high temperature found in lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>
