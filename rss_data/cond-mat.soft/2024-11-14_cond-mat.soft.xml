      <title>Emergent functional dynamics of link-bots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic active collectives, composed of many nonliving individuals capable of cooperative changes in group shape and dynamics, hold promise for practical applications and for the elucidation of guiding principles of natural collectives. However, the design of collective robotic systems that operate effectively without intelligence or complex control at either the individual or group level is challenging. We investigate how simple steric interaction constraints between active individuals produce a versatile active system with promising functionality. Here we introduce the link-bot: a V-shape-based, single-stranded chain composed of active bots whose dynamics are defined by its geometric link constraints, allowing it to possess scale- and processing-free programmable collective behaviors. A variety of emergent properties arise from this dynamic system, including locomotion, navigation, transportation, and competitive or cooperative interactions. Through the control of a few link parameters, link-bots show rich usefulness by performing a variety of divergent tasks, including traversing or obstructing narrow spaces, passing by or enclosing objects, and propelling loads in both forward and backward directions. The reconfigurable nature of the link-bot suggests that our approach may significantly contribute to the development of programmable soft robotic systems with minimal information and materials at any scale.</description>

      <title>Two-molecule theory of polyethylene liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-molecule theory refers to a class of microscopic, self-consistent field theories for the radial distribution function in classical molecular liquids. The version examined here can be considered as one of the very few formally derived closures to the reference interaction site model (RISM) equation. The theory is applied to polyethylene liquids, computing their equilibrium structural and thermodynamic properties at melt densities. The equation for the radial distribution function, which is represented as an average over the accessible states of two molecules in an external field that mimics the effects of the other molecules in the liquid, is computed by Monte Carlo simulation along with the intramolecular structure function. An improved direct sampling algorithm is utilized to speed the equilibration. Polyethylene chains of 24 and 66 united atom CH2 units are studied. Results are compared with full, many-chain molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and self-consistent polymer-RISM (PRISM) theory with the atomic Percus-Yevick (PY) closure under the same conditions. It is shown that the two-molecule theory produces results that are close to those of MD, and is thus able to overcome defects of PRISM-PY theory and predict more accurate liquid structure at both short and long range. Predictions for the equation of state are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Electrohydrodynamic flow about a colloidal particle suspended in a non-polar fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, where electrically driven fluid flows depend nonlinearly on the applied voltage, are commonly encountered in aqueous suspensions of colloidal particles. A prime example is the induced-charge electro-osmosis, driven by an electric field acting on diffuse charge induced near a polarizable surface. Nonlinear electrohydrodynamic flows also occur in non-polar fluids, driven by the electric field acting on space charge induced by conductivity gradients. Here, we analyze the flows about a charge-neutral spherical solid particle in an applied uniform electric field that arise from conductivity dependence on local field intensity. The flow pattern varies with particle conductivity: while the flow about a conducting particle has a quadrupolar pattern similar to induced-charge electro-osmosis albeit with opposite direction, the flow about an insulating particle has a more complex structure. We find that this flow induces a force on a particle near an electrode that varies non-trivially with particle conductivity: while it is repulsive for perfectly insulating particle and particles more conductive than the suspending medium, there exists a range of particle conductivities where the force is attractive. The force decays as inverse square of the distance to the electrode and thus can dominate the dielectrophoretic attraction due to the image dipole, which falls off with the fourth power with the distance. This electrohydrodynamic lift opens new possibilities for colloidal manipulation and driven assembly by electric fields.</description>

      <title>Inferring Parameter Distributions in Heterogeneous Motile Particle Ensembles: A Likelihood Approach for Second Order Langevin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of biological agents often leads to motility behavior that appears to have random components. Robust stochastic inference methods are therefore required to understand and predict the motion patterns from time discrete trajectory data provided by experiments. In many cases second order Langevin models are needed to adequately capture the motility. Additionally, population heterogeneity needs to be taken into account when analyzing data from several individual organisms. In this work, we describe a maximum likelihood approach to infer dynamical, stochastic models and, simultaneously, estimate the heterogeneity in a population of motile active particles from discretely sampled, stochastic trajectories. To this end we propose a new method to approximate the likelihood for non-linear second order Langevin models. We show that this maximum likelihood ansatz outperforms alternative approaches especially for short trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate how a measure of uncertainty for the heterogeneity estimate can be derived. We thereby pave the way for the systematic, data-driven inference of dynamical models for actively driven entities based on trajectory data, deciphering temporal fluctuations and inter-particle variability.</description>

      <title>Adhesive contact mechanics of bio-inspired pillars: exploring hysteresis and detachment modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering technologies frequently draw inspiration from nature, as exemplified in bio-inspired adhesive surfaces. These surfaces present textures adorned by pillars, mimicking the topography found on the pads of certain animals renowned for their exceptional adhesive capabilities. The adhesive response is strongly influenced by the morphology of these pillars. In typical existing models, perfect bonding conditions are assumed between the pillar and the countersurface, and solely the detachment process of the pillar from the countersurface is investigated.
  The proposed model, based on the assumption that interactions at the interface are governed by van der Waals forces modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential law, enables the examination of the entire approach and retraction cycle, tracking the movement of the pillar towards and away from the countersurface.
  Our findings reveal that adhesive contact mechanics is primarily influenced by the geometry of the pillar and the potential presence of interfacial 'defects', which in turn affect the distribution of contact pressure. Furthermore, we show that the detachment process may simultaneously involve various modes of separation, such as crack propagation from outer edge, crack propagation from inner defects, and uniform decohesion. This suggests that existing theoretical models alone cannot fully elucidate the complexity of detachment phenomena. Additionally, we anticipate the occurrence of hysteretic losses during the approach-retraction cycle, attributed to pull-in and pull-off contact jumps. Adhesive hysteresis is a phenomenon consistently observed in experiments but frequently overlooked in existing models.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interaction leads to the accumulation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii near a solid-liquid interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical mechanism of microbial motion near solid-liquid interfaces is crucial for understanding various biological phenomena and developing ecological applications. However, limited works have been conducted on the swimming behavior of C. reinhardtii, a typical "puller" type cell, near solid surfaces, particularly with varying and conflicting experimental observations. Here, we investigate the swimming behavior of C.reinhardtii using a three-dimensional real-time tracking microscopy system both near a solid-liquid interface and in the fluid bulk region. We explore the relationships between the cell density, swimming speed and orientation with respect to the distance from the solid-liquid interface, confirming the phenomenon of C. reinhardtii accumulation near the solid-liquid interface. Based on the traditional definitions of "pusher" and "puller" cells, we propose a simplified model consisting of two pairs of mutually perpendicular force dipoles for C. reinhardtii. This model is employed to analyze the complex hydrodynamic interactions between C. reinhardtii and the solid surface, providing a potential theoretical explanation for the observed accumulation phenomenon at the solid-liquid interface.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of driven probes reveal nonequilibrium transitions in complex fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs exhibit nonequilibrium behaviors that remain poorly understood. To identify changes in the fluid's microstructural conformation, we introduce a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem for laser-trapped probes dragged at a mean constant speed. Specifically, we link the different scaling regimes in the probe's position variance, obtained through large-scale Brownian simulations of a polymeric fluid, to transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind recently measured nonlinear friction curves. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method to experimentally detect nonequilibrium transitions in fluids' structure.</description>

      <title>Optimal weights and priors in simultaneous fitting of multiple small-angle scattering datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) are powerful techniques in material science and soft matter. In this study, it was addressed how multiple SAXS or SANS datasets are best weighted when doing simultaneous fitting. Three weighting schemes were tested: (1) equal weighting of all datapoints, (2) equal weighting of each dataset through normalization with the number of datapoints, (3) weighting proportional to the information content. The weighing schemes were assessed by model refinement against synthetic data under numerous conditions. The first weighting scheme led to the most accurate parameter estimation, especially when one dataset substantially outnumbered the other(s). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that inclusion of Gaussian priors significantly improved the accuracy of the refined parameters, as compared to common practice, where each parameter is constrained uniformly within an allowed interval.</description>

      <title>Passive defect driven morphogenesis in nematic membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects are ubiquitous on surfaces with orientational order fields. Here, we study equilibrium states generated by the feedback between geometry and nematic order on fluid membranes with an integer topological defect. When the Frank elastic constants associated with the orientational field dominate, the surfaces spontaneously deform toward an conical shape featuring an aster topological defect at its apex. In the case of vanishing tension this is a solution to the normal force balance. We show that the stability of the surface depends on the balance of the elastic parameters and the phase of the defect. When boundary constraints are introduced, we observe three distinct modes of deformation. These deformation modes take advantage of the way in which splay, twist and bend distortions of the director field can be exchanged on a curved surface. We discuss how these deformation modes are distinguished by their response to the cost of twist distortions and the existence of inverted solutions. Our findings show that fusion of +1/2 topological defect pairs can reduce the total energy of deformable surfaces. Finally, we argue how these results can be relevant for biological systems.</description>

      <title>Effective extensional-torsional elasticity and dynamics of helical filaments under distributed loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study slender, helical elastic rods subject to distributed forces and moments. Focussing on the case when the helix axis remains straight, we employ the method of multiple scales to systematically derive an 'equivalent-rod' theory from the Kirchhoff rod equations: the helical filament is described as a naturally-straight rod (aligned with the helix axis) for which the extensional and torsional deformations are coupled. Importantly, our analysis is asymptotically exact in the limit of a 'highly-coiled' filament (when the helical wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic lengthscale over which the filament bends due to external loading) and is able to account for large, unsteady displacements. In addition, our analysis yields explicit conditions on the external loading that must be satisfied for a straight helix axis. In the small-deformation limit, we exactly recover the coupled wave equations used to describe the free vibrations of helical coil springs, thereby justifying previous equivalent-rod approximations in which linearised stiffness coefficients are assumed to apply locally and dynamically. We then illustrate our theory with two loading scenarios: (I) a heavy helical rod deforming under its own weight; and (II) the dynamics of axial rotation (twirling) in viscous fluid, which may be considered as a simple model for a bacteria flagellar filament. In both scenarios, we demonstrate excellent agreement with solutions of the full Kirchhoff rod equations, even beyond the formal limit of validity of the highly-coiled assumption. More broadly, our analysis provides a framework to develop reduced models of helical rods in a wide variety of physical and biological settings, and yields analytical insight into their elastic instabilities. In particular, our analysis indicates that tensile instabilities are a generic phenomenon when both distributed forces and moments are present.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in filamentous cyanobacteria: from motion to structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many active systems are capable of forming intriguing patterns at scales significantly larger than the size of their individual constituents. Cyanobacteria are one of the most ancient and important phyla of organisms that has allowed the evolution of more complex life forms. Despite its importance, the role of motility on the pattern formation of their colonies is not understood. Here, we investigate the large-scale collective effects and rich dynamics of gliding filamentous cyanobacteria colonies, while still retaining information about the individual constituents' dynamics and their interactions. We investigate both the colony's transient and steady-state dynamics and find good agreement with experiments. We furthermore show that the Peclet number and aligning interaction strength govern the system's topological transition from an isotropic distribution to a state of large-scale reticulate patterns. Although the system is topologically non-trivial, the parallel and perpendicular pair correlation functions provide structural information about the colony, and thus can be used to extract information about the early stages of biofilm formation. Finally, we find that the effects of the filaments' length cannot be reduced to a system of interacting points. Our model proves to reproduce both cyanobacteria colonies and systems of biofilaments where curvature is transported by motility.</description>

Abstract: I formulate the theory of three dimensional "Malthusian flocks" -- i.e., coherently moving collections of self-propelled entities (such as living creatures) which are being "born" and "dying" during their motion -- whose constituents all have a preference for having their velocity vectors lie parallel to the same two-dimensional plane. I determine the universal scaling exponents characterizing such systems exactly, finding that the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$, the "anisotropy" exponent $\zeta=3/4$, and the "roughness" exponent $\chi=-1/2$. I also give the scaling laws implied by these exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the identification of relevant structural features that contribute to the dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass-forming liquid. By employing the recently proposed information imbalance technique, we select these features from a range of physically motivated descriptors. This selection process is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and structural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We then apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine learning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this approach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this letter, we consider collective search costs that do not only account for the search time but also for the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. First a general formalism is presented for independent agents in terms of the target survival probability for a single-agent search, where agents are allowed to be launched at arbitrary times. With this, the optimal number of searchers to be launched simultaneously at the initial time is analytically derived. Then, the optimal times at which later agents should be launched are calculated for different classes of the single-agent survival probabilities demonstrating how short- and long-time behaviors impact the optimal strategies. Finally the costs for launching new searchers are compared with those for resetting a single one.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach toward characterizing local structural features of two-dimensional particle systems. The approach can accurately identify and characterize defects in high-temperature crystals, distinguish a wide range of nominally disordered systems, and robustly describe complex structures such as grain boundaries. This paper also introduces two-dimensional functionality into the open-source software program VoroTop which automates this analysis. This software package is built on a recently-introduced multithreaded version of VORO++, enabling the analysis of systems with billions of particles on high-performance computer architectures.</description>

      <title>Breaking the angular dispersion limit in thin film optics by ultra-strong light-matter coupling</title>

Abstract: Thin film interference is integral to modern photonics and optoelectronics, e.g. allowing for precise design of high performance optical filters, efficiency enhancements in photovoltaics and light-emitting devices, as well as the realization of microlasers and high-performance photodetectors. However, interference inevitably leads to a change of spectral characteristics with angle, which is generally undesired and can limit the usefulness of thin-film coatings and devices. Here, we introduce a strategy to overcome this fundamental limit in optics by utilizing and tuning the exciton-polariton modes arising in ultra-strongly coupled microcavities. We demonstrate optical filters with narrow pass bands that shift by less than their half width (&lt;15 nm) even at extreme angles. Our filters cover the entire visible range and surpass comparable metal-dielectric-metal filters in all relevant metrics. By expanding this strategy to strong coupling with the photonic sidebands of dielectric multilayer stacks, we also obtain filters with high extinction ratios and up to 98% peak transmission. Based on these findings, we realize ultrathin and flexible narrowband filter films, monolithically integrate our filters with organic photodiodes, and demonstrate polarization-sensitive polariton filters. These results illustrate how strong coupling provides additional degrees of freedom in thin film optics that will enable a multitude of exciting new applications in micro-optics, sensing, and biophotonics.</description>

      <title>Computational Self-Assembly of a Six-Fold Chiral Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are unique materials characterized by long-range order without periodicity. They are observed in systems such as metallic alloys, soft matter, and particle simulations. Unlike periodic crystals, which are invariant under real-space symmetry operations, quasicrystals possess symmetry that requires description by a space group in reciprocal space. In this study, we report the self-assembly of a six-fold chiral quasicrystal using molecular dynamics simulations of a two-dimensional particle system. The particles interact via the Lennard-Jones-Gauss pair potential and are subjected to a periodic substrate potential. We confirm the presence of chiral symmetry through diffraction patterns and order parameters, revealing unique local motifs in both real and reciprocal space. The quasicrystal's properties, including the tiling structure and symmetry and the extent of diffuse scattering, are strongly influenced by substrate potential depth and temperature. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of chiral quasicrystal formation and the role and potential of external fields in tailoring quasicrystal structures.</description>
