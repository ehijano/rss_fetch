      <title>Enumeration of Tree-like Multigraphs with a Given Number of Vertices, Self-loops and Multiple Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting non-isomorphic tree-like multigraphs that include self-loops and multiple edges is an important problem in combinatorial enumeration, with applications in chemical graph theory, polymer science, and network modeling. Traditional counting techniques, such as Polya's theorem and branching algorithms, often face limitations due to symmetry handling and computational complexity. This study presents a unified dynamic programming framework for enumerating tree-like graphs characterized by a fixed number of vertices, self-loops, and multiple edges. The proposed method utilizes canonical rooted representations and recursive decomposition of subgraphs to eliminate redundant configurations, ensuring exact counting without the need for explicit structure generation. The framework also provides analytical bounds and recurrence relations that describe the growth behaviour of such multigraphs. This work extends previous models that treated self-loops and multiple edges separately, offering a general theoretical foundation for the enumeration of complex tree-like multigraphs in both mathematical and chemical domains.</description>

      <title>An AI enhanced approach to the tree unimodality conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18826v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, its independence sequence is the integral sequence $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of independent sets of vertices of size i. In the late 80's Alavi, Erdos, Malde, Schwenk showed that this sequence need not be unimodal for general graphs, but conjectured that it is always unimodal whenever $G$ is a tree. This conjecture was then naturally generalized to claim that the independence sequence of trees should be log concave, in the sense that $a_i^2$ is always above $a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$. This conjecture stood for many years, until in 2023, Kadrawi, Levit, Yosef, and Mizrachi proved that there were exactly two trees on 26 vertices whose independence sequence was not log concave. In this paper, we use the AI architecture PatternBoost, developed by Charton, Ellenberg, Wagner, and Williamson to train a machine to find counter-examples to the log-concavity conjecture. We will discuss the successes of this approach - finding tens of thousands of new counter-examples to log-concavity with vertex set sizes varying from 27 to 101 - and some of its fascinating failures.</description>

      <title>(Approximate) Matrix Multiplication via Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in algorithm design is whether "combinatorial" matrix multiplication algorithms -- avoiding Strassen-like divide-and-conquer -- can achieve truly subcubic runtime $n^{3-\delta}$. We present an $O(n^{2.89})$-time exact algorithm, which only sums convolutions in $\mathbb{Z}_m^k$ (multivariate polynomial multiplications) via FFT, building on the work of Cohn, Kleinberg, Szegedy and Umans (CKSU'05). While the algorithm avoids recursion, the asymptotic speedup arises only for impractically large matrices.
  Motivated by practical applications, we use this baseline to develop a new framework for fast approximate matrix multiplication (AMM), via low-degree approximations of the CKSU polynomials. We show that combining the aforementioned algorithm with black-box linear sketching already breaks the longstanding linear speed-accuracy tradeoff for AMM (Sarlos'06, Clarkson-Woodruff'13 ,Pagh'11, Cohn-Lewis'00), achieving $\frac{1}{r^{1.1}}\|\mathbf{A}\|_F^2\|\mathbf{B}\|_F^2$ error in $O(rn^2)$-time.
  Our main result is a low-degree approximation scheme for the CKSU polynomials, based on a Fourier-concentration lemma, yielding substantially smaller error in the distributional setting where $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}$ come from an i.i.d product-distribution; For random Gaussian matrices, this practical AMM algorithm attains smaller error than the best rank-$r$ SVD of the output matrix $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$, in time $O(rn^2)$. This is a substantial improvement over iterative Krylov subspace methods for low-rank approximation. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest the possibility of replacing MatMuls with sums of convolutions in LLM training and inference.</description>

      <title>The Parity-Constrained Four-Peg Tower of Hanoi Problem and Its Associated Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new four-peg variant of the Tower of Hanoi problem under parity constraints. Two pegs are neutral and allow arbitrary disc placements, while the remaining two pegs are restricted to discs of a prescribed parity: one for even-labelled discs and the other for odd-labelled discs. Within this constrained setting, we investigate four canonical optimization objectives according to distinct target configurations and derive for each the exact number of moves required to optimally transfer the discs. We establish a coupled system of recursive relations governing the four optimal move functions and unfold them into higher-order recurrences and explicit closed forms. These formulas exhibit periodic growth patterns and reveal that all solutions grow exponentially, but at a significantly slower rate than the classical three-peg case. In particular, each optimal move sequence has an a half-exponential-like asymptotic order induced by the parity restriction. In addition, we define the associated parity-constrained Hanoi graph, whose vertices represent all feasible states and whose edges represent legal moves. We determine its order, degrees, connectivity, planarity, diameter, Hamiltonicity, clique number, and chromatic properties, and show that it lies strictly between the classical three- and four-peg Hanoi graphs via the inclusion relation.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Polyominoes up to Size N=59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the results of numerical computations for determining the number of polyominoes of size n (n-ominoes). We verify the existing counts for n &lt;= 50 and newly compute the total number of polyominoes up to n &lt;= 59, extending the counting limit. This work shows that, in addition to optimizing the search algorithm for the polyomino counting problem, multi-threading dramatically improves computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generating pivot Gray codes for spanning trees of complete graphs in constant amortized time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first known pivot Gray code for spanning trees of complete graphs, listing all spanning trees such that consecutive trees differ by pivoting a single edge around a vertex. This pivot Gray code thus addresses an open problem posed by Knuth in The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4 (Exercise 101, Section 7.2.1.6, [Knuth, 2011]), rated at a difficulty level of 46 out of 50, and imposes stricter conditions than existing revolving-door or edge-exchange Gray codes for spanning trees of complete graphs. Our recursive algorithm generates each spanning tree in constant amortized time using $O(n^2)$ space. In addition, we provide a novel proof of Cayley's formula, $n^{n-2}$, for the number of spanning trees in a complete graph, derived from our recursive approach. We extend the algorithm to generate edge-exchange Gray codes for general graphs with $n$ vertices, achieving $O(n^2)$ time per tree using $O(n^2)$ space. For specific graph classes, the algorithm can be optimized to generate edge-exchange Gray codes for spanning trees in constant amortized time per tree for complete bipartite graphs, $O(n)$-amortized time per tree for fan graphs, and $O(n)$-amortized time per tree for wheel graphs, all using $O(n^2)$ space.</description>

      <title>Larger holes as narrower degree distributions in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the analysis of loops is not so much because of the complications, it has already been found that heuristically enhancing loops decreases the variance of degree distributions for improving the robustness of connectivity. While many real scale-free networks are known to contain shorter loops such as triangles, it remains to investigate the distributions of longer loops in more wide class of networks. We find a relation between narrower degree distributions and longer loops in investigating the lengths of the shortest loops in various networks with continuously changing degree distributions, including three typical types of scale-free networks, classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and regular networks. In particular, we show that narrower degree distributions contain longer shortest loops, as a universal property in a wide class of random networks. We suggest that the robustness of connectivity is enhanced by constructing long loops of O(log N).</description>

      <title>Monotonically Decreasing the Number of Directed 3-Cycles via Edge-Flips?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial reconfiguration problem on oriented graphs, where a reconfiguration step (edge-flip) is the inversion of the orientation of a single edge. A recently published conjecture that is relevant to the correctness of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for directed flag complexes states that any simple oriented graph admits a flip sequence that monotonically decreases the number of directed 3-cycles to zero, and is known to be true for complete oriented graphs.
  We show that, in general, this conjecture does not hold. As main tool for disproving the conjecture, we introduce the concept of FBD-graphs (fully blocked digraphs). An FBD-graph is a directed graph that does not contain any directed 1-, 2-, or 3-cycles, and for which any edge-flip creates a directed 3-cycle. We prove that the non-existence of FBD-graphs is a necessary condition for the conjecture to hold and succeed in constructing FBD-graphs. On the other hand, we show that complete graphs, as well as graphs in which every edge is incident to at most two triangles, cannot be fully blocked. In addition to being relevant for determining in which cases the above mentioned sampling process is correct, the concept of FBD-graphs might also be useful for other problems and yields interesting questions for further study.</description>

      <title>Optimized Degree Realization: Minimum Dominating Set &amp; Maximum Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Degree Realization problem requires, given a sequence $d$ of $n$ positive integers, to decide whether there exists a graph whose degrees correspond to $d$, and to construct such a graph if it exists. A more challenging variant of the problem arises when $d$ has many different realizations, and some of them may be more desirable than others. We study \emph{optimized realization} problems in which the goal is to compute a realization that optimizes some quality measure. Efficient algorithms are known for the problems of finding a realization with the maximum clique, the maximum independent set, or the minimum vertex cover. In this paper, we focus on two problems for which such algorithms were not known. The first is the Degree Realization with Minimum Dominating Set problem, where the goal is to find a realization whose minimum dominating set is minimized among all the realizations of the given sequence $d$. The second is the Degree Realization with Maximum Matching problem, where the goal is to find a realization with the largest matching among all the realizations of $d$. We present polynomial time realization algorithms for these two open problems.
  A related problem of interest and importance is \emph{characterizing} the sequences with a given value of the optimized function. This leads to an efficient computation of the optimized value without providing the realization that achieves that value. For the Maximum Matching problem, a succinct characterization of degree sequences with a maximum matching of a given size was known. This paper provides a succinct characterization of sequences with minimum dominating set of a given size.</description>

      <title>Reduced bandwidth: a qualitative strengthening of twin-width in minor-closed classes (and beyond)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a reduction sequence of a graph, vertices are successively identified until the graph has one vertex. At each step, when identifying $u$ and $v$, each edge incident to exactly one of $u$ and $v$ is coloured red. Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e and Watrigant [J. ACM 2022] defined the twin-width of a graph $G$ to be the minimum integer $k$ such that there is a reduction sequence of $G$ in which every red graph has maximum degree at most $k$. For any graph parameter $f$, we define the reduced $f$ of a graph $G$ to be the minimum integer $k$ such that there is a reduction sequence of $G$ in which every red graph has $f$ at most $k$. Our focus is on graph classes with bounded reduced bandwidth, which implies and is stronger than bounded twin-width (reduced maximum degree). We show that every proper minor-closed class has bounded reduced bandwidth, which is qualitatively stronger than an analogous result of Bonnet et al.\ for bounded twin-width. In many instances, we also make quantitative improvements. For example, all previous upper bounds on the twin-width of planar graphs were at least $2^{1000}$. We show that planar graphs have reduced bandwidth at most $466$ and twin-width at most $583$. Our bounds for graphs of Euler genus $\gamma$ are $O(\gamma)$. Lastly, we show that fixed powers of graphs in a proper minor-closed class have bounded reduced bandwidth (irrespective of the degree of the vertices). In particular, we show that map graphs of Euler genus $\gamma$ have reduced bandwidth $O(\gamma^4)$. Lastly, we separate twin-width and reduced bandwidth by showing that any infinite class of expanders excluding a fixed complete bipartite subgraph has unbounded reduced bandwidth, while there are bounded-degree expanders with twin-width at most 6.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <title>Complete polyhedral description of chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical graphs are simple undirected connected graphs, where vertices represent atoms in a molecule and edges represent chemical bonds. A degree-based topological index is a molecular descriptor used to study specific physicochemical properties of molecules. Such an index is computed from the sum of the weights of the edges of a chemical graph, each edge having a weight defined by a formula that depends only on the degrees of its endpoints. Given any degree-based topological index and given two integers $n$ and $m$, we are interested in determining chemical graphs of order $n$ and size $m$ that maximize or minimize the index. Focusing on chemical graphs with maximum degree at most 3, we show that this reduces to determining the extreme points of a polytope that contains at most 10 facets. We also show that the number of extreme points is at most 16, which means that for any given $n$ and $m$, there are very few different classes of extremal graphs, independently of the chosen degree-based topological index.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Latin Squares of Order Ten with Two Relations: A SAT Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $k$-net($n$) is a combinatorial design equivalent to $k-2$ mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$. A relation in a net is a linear dependency over $\mathbb{F}_2$ in the incidence matrix of the net. A computational enumeration of all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order 10 whose corresponding nets have at least two nontrivial relations was achieved by Delisle in 2010 and verified by an independent search of Myrvold. In this paper, we confirm the correctness of their exhaustive enumerations with a satisfiability (SAT) solver approach instead of using custom-written backtracking code. Performing the enumeration using a SAT solver has at least three advantages. First, it reduces the amount of trust necessary, as SAT solvers produce independently-verifiable certificates that their enumerations are complete. These certificates can be checked by formal proof verifiers that are relatively simple pieces of software, and therefore easier to trust. Second, it is typically more straightforward and less error-prone to use a SAT solver over writing search code. Third, it can be more efficient to use a SAT-based approach, as SAT solvers are highly optimized pieces of software incorporating backtracking-with-learning for improving the efficiency of the backtracking search. For example, the SAT solver completely enumerates all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order ten with two nontrivial relations in under 2 hours on a desktop machine, while Delisle's 2010 search used 11,700 CPU hours. Although computer hardware was slower in 2010, this alone cannot explain the improvement in the efficiency of our SAT-based search.</description>

Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those with mixed splitting rules.</description>

Abstract: Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.
  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.
  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</description>
