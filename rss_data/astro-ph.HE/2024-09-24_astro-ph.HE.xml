      <title>The formation of mini-AGN disks around IMBHs and their dynamical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the formation and implications of mini-active galactic nuclei (mAGN) disks around intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) embedded in gas-rich globular/nuclear clusters (GCs). We examine the parameter space for stable mAGN disks, considering the influence of IMBH mass, disk radius, and gas density on disk stability. The dynamics of stars and black holes within the mAGN disk are modeled, with a focus on gas-induced migration and gas dynamical friction. These dynamical processes can lead to several potentially observable phenomena, including the alignment of stellar orbits into the disk plane, the enhancement of gravitational wave mergers (particularly IMRIs and EMRIs), and the occurrence of mili/centi-tidal disruption events (mTDEs/cTDEs) with unique observational signatures. We find that gas hardening can significantly accelerate the inspiral of binaries within the disk, potentially leading to a frequency shift in the emitted gravitational waves. Additionally, we explore the possibility of forming accreting IMBH systems from captured binaries within the mAGN disk, potentially resulting in the formation of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The observational implications of such accreting systems, including X-ray emission, optical signatures, and transient phenomena, are discussed. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of large-scale jets emanating from gas-embedded IMBHs in GCs. While several caveats and uncertainties exist, our work highlights the potential for mAGN disks to provide unique insights into IMBH demographics, accretion physics, and the dynamics of GCs.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal GeV emission from the Nereides nebula: confirming the nature of the supernova remnant G107.7-5.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the Nereides nebula was discovered through deep optical emission line observations and was classified as a supernova remnant (SNR) candidate, G107.7-5.1. Since very little is known about this SNR we look at several archival data sets to better understand the environment and properties of the object. We present a detailed analysis of the gamma-ray emission detected by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope in the region of the nebula. A model of the non-thermal emission is presented which allows us to derive the particle distribution responsible for the gamma rays. We also use molecular gas and atomic hydrogen observations to try to constrain the source age and distance. An extended (~2deg) GeV source coincident with the location of the nebula is found. The non-thermal emission has a hard spectrum and is detected up to about 100 GeV, confirming the SNR nature of this object. The GeV properties of G107.7-5.1 are similar to those of other SNRs such as G150.3+4.5, and likely expands in a relatively low-density medium. The Nereides nebula is one more example of a growing population of dim SNRs detected at high energies. A simple leptonic model is able to account for the gamma-ray emission. Standard SNR evolutionary models constrain the age to be in the 10-50 kyr range, which is consistent with estimates of the maximum particle energy obtained from GeV observations. However, more detailed observations of the source should be carried out to better understand its properties.</description>

      <title>Probing properties of nearly two-hundred new active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray spectral properties of 198 newly identified active galactic nuclei (AGNs), leveraging archival data from the {\it Chandra} X-ray Observatory. All these AGNs exhibit a powerlaw spectral signature spanning a broad energy range of $0.5-7.0$ keV, characterized by the photon index ($\Gamma$) values ranging from $0.3^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ to $2.54^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$. Particularly, 76 of these AGNs display discernible levels of intrinsic absorption, after considering the Galactic absorption. The column densities associated with this local absorption ($n_{\rm H}^{\rm local}$) are within a range of $\sim 10^{19} - 10^{22}\ {\rm cm^{-2}}$. We study the cosmological evolution of AGNs using the variation of $n_{\rm H}^{\rm local}$ and $\Gamma$ with their estimated redshift. The intrinsic spectral signature did not reveal any significant cosmological evolution; however, a deficit of hard sources at high redshift is possibly intrinsic. Our sample covers several decades of broadband intrinsic luminosity ($L_{\rm B}^{\rm intr}$) ranging from $4.59^{+0.41}_{-0.41} \times 10^{42}$ to $2.4^{+0.12}_{-0.12} \times 10^{46}\, {\rm erg~s}^{-1}$ with peak at 1.84 redshift. We also investigate the hardness-luminosity diagram (HLD) to further probe the AGNs. We conduct a sanity check by applying our findings to known AGNs, and the results are consistent with our observations.</description>

      <title>SN 2023tsz: A helium-interaction driven supernova in a very low-mass galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2023tsz is a Type Ibn supernova (SNe Ibn) discovered in an extremely low-mass host. SNe Ibn are an uncommon subtype of stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe. They are characterised by narrow helium emission lines in their spectra and are believed to originate from the collapse of massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, though their progenitor systems still remain poorly understood. In terms of energetics and spectrophotometric evolution, SN 2023tsz is largely a typical example of the class, although line profile asymmetries in the nebular phase are seen, which may indicate the presence of dust formation or unshocked circumstellar material. Intriguingly, SN 2023tsz is located in an extraordinarily low-mass host galaxy that is in the 2nd percentile for SESN host masses and star formation rates (SFR). The host has a radius of 1.0 kpc, a $g$-band absolute magnitude of $-12.73$, and an estimated metallicity of $\log(Z_{*}/Z_{\odot}$) = $-1.56$. The SFR and metallicity of the host galaxy raise questions about the progenitor of SN 2023tsz. The low SFR suggests that a star with sufficient mass to evolve into a WR would be uncommon in this galaxy. Further, the very low-metallicity is a challenge for single stellar evolution to enable H and He stripping of the progenitor and produce a SN Ibn explosion. The host galaxy of SN 2023tsz adds another piece to the ongoing puzzle of SNe Ibn progenitors, and demonstrates that they can occur in hosts too faint to be observed in contemporary sky surveys at a more typical SN Ibn redshift.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Numerical Simulations in Accretion Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion physics studies the process of gravitational capture of ambient matter by massive stars. The background processes are very challenging to observe and measure due to the extreme conditions in these systems. Numerical simulations play a crucial role in accretion physics because they provide the only practical method to model the complex processes occurring in accretion disks. In this review, we outline different branches of numerical simulations, such as hydrodynamic simulations, magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and Monte-Carlo simulations, and their methodology, and we discuss possible implications for modeling accretion physics around black holes, neutron stars, and protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Shock breakouts from compact CSM surrounding core-collapse SN progenitors may contribute significantly to the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during $\sim1$ yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) shell at $\sim10^{14.5}$ cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of $\sim10^4$ for $&gt;100$ GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing $&gt;1$ neutrino event in a 1 km$^2$ detector are expected at a rate of $\lesssim0.1$/yr. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, $&lt;1$ d old SNe, to determine the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.</description>

      <title>Detection of QPO Soft Lag during Outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613: Estimation of Instrinsic Parameters from Spectral Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered bright transient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 is studied in a broad energy range ($0.5-79$ keV) using combined NICER and NuSTAR data on 29 August 2023. A promonient type-C Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) at $0.89 \pm 0.01$ Hz with its harmonic was observed in NICER data of $0.5-10$ keV. Interestingly, the harmonic becomes weaker in the lower energy bands ($0.5-1$ &amp; $1-3$ keV). We also report the first detection of a soft time-lag of $0.014 \pm 0.001$ s at the QPO frequency between harder ($3-10$ kev) and softer ($0.5-3$ keV) band photons observed with the NICER/XTI instrument. This indicates that the inclination of the accretion disk in the binary system might be high. From the detailed spectral analysis with the relxill reflection model, we found the disk inclination angle of source to be $\sim 85^\circ$. We discuss how the accretion flow configuration inferred from spectral analysis can help us to understand the origin of QPOs and soft lag in this source.</description>

      <title>Layout optimization and Performance of Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT) is an array of 32 Cherenkov telescopes with 6-meter diameter mirrors to be constructed at the LHAASO site. In this work, we present a study on the layout optimization and performance analysis of LACT. We investigate two observation modes: large zenith angle observations for ultra-high energy events and small zenith angle observations for lower energy thresholds. For large zenith angles (60{\deg}), simulations show that an 8-telescope subarray can achieve an effective area of $3 ~\rm km^2$ and excellent angular resolution. For small zenith angles, we optimize the layout of 4-telescope cells and the full 32-telescope array. The threshold of the full array is about $200~\rm GeV$, which is particularly crucial for studying transient phenomena, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This study provides important guidance for the final LACT layout design and performance estimates under different observational conditions, demonstrating LACT's potential for deep observations of ultra-high energy \gray sources and morphological studies of PeVatrons, as well as time-domain \gray astronomy.</description>

      <title>Origin of Black Hole Spin in Lower-Mass-Gap Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration reported the detection of a coalescing compact binary (GW230529$_{-}$181500) with component masses estimated at $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ with 90\% credibility. Given the current constraints on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, this event is most likely a lower-mass-gap (LMG) black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary. The spin magnitude of the BH, especially when aligned with the orbital angular momentum, is critical in determining whether the NS is tidally disrupted. An LMG BHNS merger with a rapidly spinning BH is an ideal candidate for producing electromagnetic counterparts. However, no such signals have been detected. In this study, we employ a detailed binary evolution model, incorporating new dynamical tide implementations, to explore the origin of BH spin in an LMG BHNS binary. If the NS forms first, the BH progenitor (He-rich star) must begin in orbit shorter than 0.35 days to spin up efficiently, potentially achieving a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} &gt; 0.3$. Alternatively, if a non-spinning BH (e.g., $M_{\rm BH} = 3.6\, M_\odot$) forms first, it can accrete up to $\sim 0.2\, M_\odot$ via Case BA mass transfer (MT), reaching a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim 0.18$ under Eddington-limited accretion. With a higher Eddington accretion limit (i.e., 10.0 $\Dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH can attain a significantly higher spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim\,0.65$ by accreting approximately $1.0\, M_\odot$ during Case BA MT phase.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Supernova Gravitational Wave Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of using gravitational wave (GW) signals from rotating core-collapse supernovae to probe the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. By generating GW signals from simulations with various EOSs, we train machine learning models to classify them and evaluate their performance. Our study builds on previous work by examining how different machine learning models, parameters, and data preprocessing techniques impact classification accuracy. We test convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as six classical algorithms: random forest, support vector machines, naive Bayes, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and eXtreme gradient boosting. All models, except naive Bayes, achieve over 90 per cent accuracy on our dataset. Additionally, we assess the impact of approximating the GW signal using the general relativistic effective potential (GREP) on EOS classification. We find that models trained on GREP data exhibit low classification accuracy. However, normalizing time by the peak signal frequency, which partially compensates for the absence of the time dilation effect in GREP, leads to a notable improvement in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Kalman tracking and parameter estimation of continuous gravitational waves with a pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous nanohertz gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries may be detectable with pulsar timing arrays. A novel search strategy is developed, wherein intrinsic achromatic spin wandering is tracked simultaneously with the modulation induced by a single gravitational wave source in the pulse times of arrival. A two-step inference procedure is applied within a state-space framework, such that the modulation is tracked with a Kalman filter, which then provides a likelihood for nested sampling. The procedure estimates the static parameters in the problem, such as the sky position of the source, without fitting for ensemble-averaged statistics such as the power spectral density of the timing noise, and therefore complements traditional parameter estimation methods. It also returns the Bayes factor relating a model with a single gravitational wave source to one without, complementing traditional detection methods. It is shown via astrophysically representative software injections in Gaussian measurement noise that the procedure distinguishes a gravitational wave from pure noise down to a characteristic wave strain of $h_0 \approx 2 \times 10^{-15}$. Full posterior distributions of model parameters are recovered and tested for accuracy. There is a bias of $\approx 0.3$ rad in the marginalised one-dimensional posterior for the orbital inclination $\iota$, introduced by dropping the so-called `pulsar terms'. Smaller biases $\lesssim 10 \%$ are also observed in other static parameters.</description>

      <title>Laboratorial radiative shocks with multiple parameters and first quantifying verifications to core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experiments to reproduce the characteristics of core-collapse supernovae with different stellar masses and initial explosion energies in the laboratory. In the experiments, shocks are driven in 1.2 atm and 1.9 atm xenon gas by laser with energy from 1600J to 2800J on the SGIII prototype laser facility. The average shock velocities and shocked densities are obtained from experiments. Experimental results reveal that higher laser energy and lower Xe gas density led to higher shock velocity, and lower Xe gas initial density has a higher compression. Modeling of the experiments using the 2D radiation hydrodynamic codes Icefire shows excellent agreement with the experimental results and gives the temperature. These results will contribute to time-domain astrophysical systems, such as gravitational supernovae, where a strong radiative shock propagates outward from the center of the star after the core collapses.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multiband Photometry of the Early Optical Afterglow of GRB 240825A with Mephisto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The interaction of the relativistic jet with the circumburst medium produces an afterglow and generates multiwavelength emission. In this work, we present simultaneous multiband photometry of GRB~240825A with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) and analyze its temporal and spectral properties. The measurement began 128 seconds after the GRB trigger and continued until the fourth day when the afterglow essentially diminished and the measured brightness was close to that of the host galaxy. Based on the multiband light curves in the $uvgriz$ bands, we find that the optical flux density satisfies $F_{\nu,{\rm obs}}\propto t^{-1.34}\nu^{-2.48}$ with a spectral index of $2.48$ much larger than those of most other GRBs. To reconcile the measured much softer spectral energy distribution (SED) with that predicted by the standard afterglow model, an extra host-galaxy extinction of $E_{B-V}\sim(0.37-0.57)$ mag is required. We interpreted this excess as arising from a dense circumburst medium. We further find that the SED of the optical afterglow hardened as the afterglow decayed and the color excess $E_{B-V}$ decreased $\sim0.21$ mag in the first 3000 seconds. Finally, we analyze the properties of the host galaxy of GRB~240825A based on data from the SDSS, PanSTARRS and HSC-SSP surveys. For a host redshift of $z=0.659$, the stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy are estimated to be $\log(M_*/M_\odot)=10.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ and $\log({\rm SFR}/M_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1})= 0.6^{+0.8}_{-3.3}$, respectively, pointing to a gas-rich, star-forming, medium-size galaxy.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the comptonization region of MAXI J1348$-$630 through type-C quasi-periodic oscillations with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the rms and lag spectra of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) to study the properties of the Comptonisation region (aka corona) during the low/hard and hard-intermediate states of the main outburst and reflare of MAXI J1348$-$630. We simultaneously fit the time-averaged energy spectrum of the source and the fractional rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO with the time-dependent Comptonization model vKompth. The data can be explained by two physically connected coronae interacting with the accretion disc via a feedback loop of X-ray photons. The best-fitting model consists of a corona of $\sim$10$^3$ km located at the inner edge of the disc and a second corona of $\sim$10$^4$ km horizontally extended and covering the inner parts of the accretion disc. The properties of both coronae during the reflare are similar to those during the low/hard state of the main outburst, reinforcing the idea that both the outburst and the reflare are driven by the same physical mechanisms. We combine our results for the type-C QPO with those from previous work focused on the study of type-A and type-B QPOs with the same model to study the evolution of the geometry of the corona through the whole outburst, including the reflare of MAXI J1348$-$630. Finally, we show that the sudden increase in the phase-lag frequency spectrum and the sharp drop in the coherence function previously observed in MAXI J1348$-$630 are due to the type-C QPO during the decay of the outburst and can be explained in terms of the geometry of the coronae.</description>

      <title>A NICER View of PSR J1231-1411: A Complex Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent constraints on neutron star mass and radius have advanced our understanding of the equation of state of cold dense matter. Some of them have been obtained by modeling the pulses of three millisecond X-ray pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Here, we present a Bayesian parameter inference for a fourth pulsar, PSR J1231-1411, using the same technique with NICER and XMM-Newton data. When applying a broad mass-inclination prior from radio timing measurements and the emission region geometry model that can best explain the data, we find likely-converged results only when using a limited radius prior. If limiting the radius to be consistent with the previous observational constraints and equation of state analyses, we infer the radius to be $12.6 \pm 0.3$ km and the mass to be $1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$ $M_\odot$, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the $16\,\%$ and $84\,\%$ quantiles. If using an uninformative prior but limited between $10$ and $14$ km, we find otherwise similar results, but $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 13.5_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ km for the radius. In both cases, we find a non-antipodal hot region geometry where one emitting spot is at the equator or slightly above, surrounded by a large colder region, and where a non-circular hot region lies close to southern rotational pole. If using a wider radius prior, we only find solutions that fit the data significantly worse. We discuss the challenges in finding the better fitting solutions, possibly related to the weak interpulse feature in the pulse profile.</description>

      <title>Neutron Tagging Can Greatly Reduce Spallation Backgrounds in Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande's spallation backgrounds - the delayed beta decays of nuclides following cosmic-ray muons - are nearly all produced by the small fraction of muons with hadronic showers. We show that these hadronic showers also produce neutrons; their captures can be detected with high efficiency due to the recent addition of dissolved gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande. We show that new cuts based on the neutron tagging of showers could reduce spallation backgrounds by a factor of at least four beyond present cuts. With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic field at the cluster virial radius with volume-filling radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos and radio relics probe the existence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. These nonthermal components are generated from the dissipation of kinetic energy released by turbulence and shocks injected in the intracluster medium (ICM) during the large-scale structure formation process. By using the deepest images ever obtained on a galaxy cluster at low-frequency (72 h LOFAR-HBA + 72 h LOFAR-LBA), in arXiv:2211.01493 we provided an unprecedented view of the distribution of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in the far outskirts of Abell 2255. In particular, we observed pervasive radio emission that fills the entire cluster volume and extends up to the cluster virial radius, reaching a maximum projected linear size of 5 Mpc. By combining radio and X-ray observations with advanced numerical simulations, we estimated the magnetic field and energy budget associated to turbulent motions at such large distances from the cluster center. Our results suggest an efficient transfer of kinetic energy into nonthermal components in the extremely diluted cluster outskirts. In the past two years, the total LOFAR-HBA observation time on Abell 2255 has increased to 336 hours. The analysis of this ultra-deep dataset aims to further advance our understanding of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in cluster peripheries.</description>

      <title>ESIGMAHM: An Eccentric, Spinning inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with Higher Modes for the detection and characterization of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a time-domain inspiral-merger-ringdowm (IMR) waveform model ESIGMAHM constructed within a framework we named ESIGMA for coalescing binaries of spinning black holes on moderately eccentric orbits (Huerta et al. (2018) [Phys. Rev. D 97, 024031]). We now include the effect of black hole spins on the dynamics of eccentric binaries, as well as model sub-dominant waveform harmonics emitted by them. The inspiral evolution is described by a consistent combination of latest results from post-Newtonian theory, self-force, and black hole perturbation theory. We assume that these moderately eccentric binaries radiate away most of their orbital eccentricity before merger, and seamlessly connect the eccentric inspiral with a numerical relativity based surrogate waveform model for mergers of spinning binaries on quasi-circular orbits. We validate ESIGMAHM against eccentric Numerical Relativity simulations, and also against contemporary effective-one-body and phenomenological models in the quasi-circular limit. We find that ESIGMAHM achieves match values greater than $99\%$ for quasi-circular spin-aligned binaries with mass ratios up to $8$, and above $97\%$ for non-spinning and spinning eccentric systems with small or positively aligned spins. Using IMRESIGMA, we quantify the impact of orbital eccentricity on GW signals, showing that next-generation detectors can detect eccentric sources up to $10\%$ louder than quasi-circular ones. We also show that current templated LIGO-Virgo searches will lose more than $10\%$ of optimal SNR for about $20\%$ of all eccentric sources by using only quasi-circular waveform templates. The same will result in a $25\%$ loss in detection rate for eccentric sources with mass ratios $m_1/m_2\geq 4$. Our results highlight the need for including eccentricity and higher-order modes in GW source models and searches for asymmetric eccentric BBH signals.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight dark matter. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modelled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

      <title>Effective potential approach to study hydrodynamics and particle dynamics in Kerr geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the exact form of effective potential in Kerr geometry from the general relativistic radial momentum equation. The effective potential accurately mimics the general relativistic features, over the entire range of the spin parameter $-1&lt;a&lt;1$. We obtain the exact expression of the rate of dragging of inertial frames that can be used to study the relativistic precession of twisted accretion disks that are formed when the disk outskirts are tilted relative to the equatorial plane of the black hole. We then present an effective potential that provides a simplistic approach to study particle dynamics using physical concepts analogous to the Newtonian physics. We compare the equatorial as well as off-equatorial particle trajectories obtained using our potential with the general relativistic solutions. We find that our approach can capture the salient features of Kerr geometry and is applicable to studies of accretion processes around Kerr black holes.</description>

Abstract: HERMES (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites) Pathfinder mission aims to observe and localize Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) and other transients using a constellation of nanosatellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Scheduled for launch in early 2025, the 3U CubeSats will host miniaturized instruments featuring a hybrid Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) and GAGG:Ce scintillator photodetector system, sensitive to X-rays and gamma-rays across a wide energy range. Each HERMES payload contains 120 SDD cells, each with a sensitive area of 45 mm^2, organized into 12 matrices, reading out 60 12.1x6.94x15.0 mm^3 GAGG:Ce scintillators. Photons interacting with an SDD are identified as X-ray events (2-60 keV), while photons in the 20-2000 keV range absorbed by the crystals produce scintillation light, which is read by two SDDs, allowing event discrimination. The detector system, including front-end and back-end electronics, a power supply unit, a chip-scale atomic clock, and a payload data handling unit, fits within a 10x10x10 cm^3 volume, weighs 1.5 kg, and has a maximum power consumption of about 2 W. This paper outlines the development of the HERMES constellation, the design and selection of the payload detectors, and laboratory testing, presenting the results of detector calibrations and environmental tests to provide a comprehensive status update of the mission.</description>

      <title>Investigating 39 Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars with VLTI/GRAVITY: Uncovering A Long Period Binary Desert</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are thought to be the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and immediate progenitors of stellar-mass black holes. Their multiplicity forms an important anchor point in single and binary population models for predicting gravitational-wave progenitors. Recent spectroscopic campaigns have suggested incompatible multiplicity fractions and period distributions for N- and C-rich Galactic WRs (WNs and WCs) at short as well as long orbital periods, in contradiction with evolutionary model predictions. In this work, we employed infrared interferometry using the $K$-band instrument GRAVITY at the VLTI to investigate the multiplicity of WRs at long periods and explore the nature of their companions. We present a survey of 39 Galactic WRs, including 11 WN, 15 WC and 13 H-rich WN (WNh) stars. We detected wide companions with GRAVITY for only four stars: WR 48, WR 89, WR 93 and WR 115. Combining with spectroscopic studies, we arrived at multiplicity fractions of $f^{\rm WN}_{\rm obs} = 0.55\pm0.15$, $f^{\rm WC}_{\rm obs} = 0.40\pm0.13$ and $f^{\rm WNh}_{\rm obs} = 0.23\pm0.12$. In addition, we also found other features in the GRAVITY dataset such as (i) a diffuse extended component in over half the WR sample; (ii) five known spectroscopic binaries resolved in differential phase data and (iii) spatially resolved winds in four stars: WR 16, WR 31a, WR 78 and WR 110. Our survey reveals a lack of intermediate (few 100s d) and long- (few years to decades) period WR systems. The 200-d peak in the period distributions of WR+OB and BH+OB binaries predicted by Case B mass-transfer binary evolution models is not seen in our data. The rich companionship of their O-type progenitors in this separation range suggest that the WR progenitor stars expand and interact with their companions, most likely through unstable mass-transfer, resulting in either a short-period system or a merger.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a pilot project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos, or free-floating supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that might be comprised of primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9 M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz, and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. Using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and their mimickers. Using the above constraints, we rule out 32 out of our initial 40 candidates as milli-lenses, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we find many new candidates for compact symmetric objects, that are thought to be short-lived, jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the SMILE (Search for MIlli-LEnses) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>

      <title>Indication of Sharp and Strong Phase-Transitions from NICER Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a new, weakly model-dependent, test for ``standard" equations of state (EoS) models that disfavor sharp and strong phase-transitions, by using neutron star mass and radius observations. We show the radii of two neutron stars observed by NICER (PSR J0740+6620 and PSR 0030+0451) are correlated if these two neutron stars are built upon standard EoS models. The radii of neutron stars with different masses are sensitive to the pressures at different densities, and the pressures at different densities are strongly correlated in standard EoS models. We further show that the correlation of the neutron star radii can be significantly weakened, when additional degrees of freedom concerning the first-order phase transitions are added into the EoSs. We propose a new quantity, ${D}_{\mathrm{L}}$, which measures the extent to which the linear correlation of the radii of two neutron stars is weakened. Our method gives a $48\%$ identification probability (with a $5\%$ false alarm rate) of finding beyond standard EoS models in NICER observations. Future observations with higher measurement accuracy can confirm or rule out this identification. Our method is generalizable to any pair of neutron star masses and can be employed with other sets of observations in the future.</description>

      <title>Disc Novae: Thermodynamics of Gas Assisted Binary Black Hole Formation in AGN Discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of close encounters between stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), during which binary black holes (BBHs) may form. We consider a suite of 2D viscous hydrodynamical simulations within a shearing box prescription using the Eulerian grid code Athena++. We study formation scenarios where the fluid is either an isothermal gas or an adiabatic mixture of gas and radiation in local thermal equilibrium. We include the effects of viscous and shock heating, as well as optically thick cooling. We co-evolve the embedded BHs with the gas, keeping track of the energetic dissipation and torquing of the BBH by gas and inertial forces. We find that compared to the isothermal case, the minidiscs formed around each BH are significantly hotter and more diffuse, though BBH formation is still efficient. We observe massive blast waves arising from collisions between the radiative minidiscs during both the initial close encounter, and subsequent periapsis periods for successfully bound BBHs. These "disc novae" have a profound effect, depleting the BBH Hill sphere of gas and injecting energy into the surrounding medium. In analysing the thermal emission from these events, we observe periodic peaks in local luminosity associated with close encounters/periapses, with emission peaking in the optical/near-IR. In the AGN outskirts, these outbursts can reach 4% of the AGN luminosity in the IR band, with flares rising over 0.5-1year. Collisions in different disc regions, or when treated in 3D with magnetism, may produce more prominent flares.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Supernova 1987A Shock Breakout</title>

Abstract: Shock breakout is the first electromagnetic signal from supernovae (SNe), which contains important information on the explosion energy and the size and chemical composition of the progenitor star. This paper presents the first two-dimensional (2D) multi-wavelength radiation hydrodynamics simulations of SN 1987A shock breakout by using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code with the opacity table, $\texttt{OPAL}$, considering eight photon groups from infrared to X-ray. To investigate the impact of the pre-supernova environment of SN 1987A, we consider three possible circumstellar medium (CSM) environments: a steady wind, an eruptive mass loss, and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour duration and its peak luminosity of $\sim 4\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ then following a decay rate of $\sim 3.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ in X-ray. The dominant band transits to UV around 3 hours after the initial breakout, and its luminosity has a decay rate of $\sim 1.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Furthermore, our 2D simulations demonstrate the importance of multidimensional mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing emerging from the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later supernova remnant formation.</description>

      <title>Implication of Jet Physics from MeV Line Emission of GRB 221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic jets are believed to play an important role in producing prompt emission and afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the nature of the jet is poorly known owing to the lack of decisive features observed in the prompt emission. The discovery of an emission line evolving from about 37 to 6 MeV in the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe GRB jet physics. The time evolution of the central energy of the line with power-law index $-1$ is naturally explained by the high-latitude curvature effect. Under the assumption that the line emission is generated in the prompt emission by $e^\pm$ pair production, cooling, and annihilation in the jet, we can strictly constrain jet physics with observed line emission properties. We find that the radius of the emission region is $r\gtrsim10^{16}$ cm. The narrow line width of $\sim10\%$ requires that the line emission occurs within $\sim10\%$ of the dynamical time, which further implies short timescales of pair cooling to the nonrelativistic state and pair annihilation, as well as a slightly clumpy emission region. If the jet's Lorentz factor is $\Gamma\gtrsim400$, the fast cooling requirement needs an energy density of magnetic field in the jet much larger than that of prompt gamma rays, i.e., a magnetically dominated jet. The temporal behavior of line flux suggests some angle dependence of line emission. We also discuss the difficulties of other scenarios for the observed emission line.</description>

      <title>Merger Precursor: Year-long Transients Preceding Mergers of Low-mass Stripped Stars with Compact Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.</description>

      <title>Robustness of neutron star merger simulations to changes in neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions</title>

Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers play an important role in nuclear astrophysics: their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals carry information about the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear saturation density, and they may be one of the main sources of r-process elements in the Universe. Neutrino-matter interactions during and after merger impact the properties of these electromagnetic signals, and the relative abundances of the produced r-process elements. Existing merger simulations are however limited in their ability to realistically model neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions. Here, we perform a comparison of the impact of the use of state-of-the art two-moment or Monte-Carlo transport schemes on the outcome of merger simulations, for a single binary neutron star system with a short-lived neutron star remnant ($(5-10)\,{\rm ms}$). We also investigate the use of different reaction rates in the simulations. While the best transport schemes generally agree well on the qualitative impact of neutrinos on the system, differences in the behavior of the high-density regions can significantly impact the collapse time and the properties of the hot tidal arms in this metastable merger remnant. The chosen interaction rates, transport algorithm, as well as recent improvements by Radice et al to the two-moment algorithms can all contribute to changes at the $(10-30)\%$ level in the global properties of the merger remnant and outflows. The limitations of previous moment schemes fixed by Radice et al also appear sufficient to explain the large difference that we observed in the production of heavy-lepton neutrinos in a previous comparison of Monte-Carlo and moment schemes in the context of a low mass binary neutron star system.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pulsars, Magnetars, and Fast Radio Bursts in the Sculptor Galaxy using MeerKAT</title>

Abstract: The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), located in the Southern Hemisphere, far off the Galactic Plane, has a relatively high star-formation rate of about 7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and hosts a young and bright stellar population, including several super star clusters and supernova remnants. It is also the first galaxy, apart from the Milky Way Galaxy to be associated with two giant magnetar flares. As such, it is a potential host of pulsars and/or fast radio bursts in the nearby Universe. The instantaneous sensitivity and multibeam sky coverage offered by MeerKAT therefore make it a favourable target. We searched for pulsars, radio-emitting magnetars, and fast radio bursts in NGC 253 as part of the TRAPUM large survey project with MeerKAT. We did not find any pulsars during a four-hour observation, and derive a flux density limit of 4.4 $\mu$Jy at 1400 MHz, limiting the pseudo-luminosity of the brightest putative pulsar in this galaxy to 54 Jy kpc$^2$. Assuming universality of pulsar populations between galaxies, we estimate that detecting a pulsar as bright as this limit requires NGC 253 to contain a pulsar population of $\gtrsim$20 000. We also did not detect any single pulses and our single pulse search flux density limit is 62 mJy at 1284 MHz. Our search is sensitive enough to have detected any fast radio bursts and radio emission similar to the brighter pulses seen from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 if they had occurred during our observation.</description>

      <title>A search for persistent radio sources toward repeating fast radio bursts discovered by CHIME/FRB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of persistent radio sources (PRSs) coincident with two repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) supports FRB theories requiring a compact central engine. However, deep non-detections in other cases highlight the diversity of repeating FRBs and their local environments. Here, we perform a systematic search for radio sources towards 37 CHIME/FRB repeaters using their arcminute localizations and a combination of archival surveys and targeted observations. Through multi-wavelength analysis of individual radio sources, we identify two (20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1) for which we disfavor an origin of either star formation or an active galactic nucleus in their host galaxies and thus consider them candidate PRSs. We do not find any associated PRSs for the majority of the repeating FRBs in our sample. For 8 FRB fields with Very Large Array imaging, we provide deep limits on the presence of PRSs that are 2--4 orders of magnitude fainter than the PRS associated with FRB\,20121102A. Using Very Large Array Sky Survey imaging of all 37 fields, we constrain the rate of luminous ($\gtrsim$10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) PRSs associated with repeating FRBs to be low. Within the context of FRB-PRS models, we find that 20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1 can be reasonably explained within the context of magnetar, hypernebulae, gamma-ray burst afterglow, or supernova ejecta models -- although we note that both sources follow the radio luminosity versus rotation measure relationship predicted in the nebula model framework. Future observations will be required to both further characterize and confirm the association of these PRS candidates with the FRBs.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating dark sirens and galaxies: constraints on $H_0$ from GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the cross-correlation technique to infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) of the Universe using gravitational wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts (dark sirens) from the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and the photometric galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISE-SuperCOSMOS, and combine these with the bright siren measurement of $H_0$ from GW170817. The posterior on $H_0$ with only dark sirens is uninformative due to the small number of well-localised GW sources. Using the eight well-localized dark sirens and the binary neutron star GW170817 with EM counterpart, we obtain a value of the Hubble constant $H_0= 75.4_{-6}^{+11}$ km/s/Mpc (median and 68.3$\%$ equal-tailed interval (ETI)) after marginalizing over the matter density and the GW bias parameters. This measurement is mostly driven by the bright siren measurement and any constraint from dark sirens is not statistically significant. In the future, with more well-localized GW events, the constraints on expansion history will improve.</description>

Abstract: Wave packets propagating in inhomogeneous media experience a coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, follow spin-dependent trajectories. These phenomena, well known in optics and condensed matter physics, are referred to as spin Hall effects. Similarly, the gravitational spin Hall effect is expected to affect the propagation of gravitational waves on curved spacetimes. In this general-relativistic setup, the curvature of spacetime acts as impurities in a semiconductor or inhomogeneities in an optical medium, leading to a frequency- and polarization-dependent propagation of wave packets. In this letter, we study this effect for strong-field lensed gravitational waves generated in hierarchical triple black hole systems in which a stellar-mass binary merges near a more massive black hole. We calculate how the gravitational spin Hall effect modifies the gravitational waveforms and show its potential for experimental observation. If detected, these effects will have profound implications for astrophysics and tests of general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate close encounters by stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a potential formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs). We perform a series of 2D isothermal viscous hydrodynamical simulations within a shearing box prescription using the Eulerian grid code Athena++. We co-evolve the embedded BHs with the gas keeping track of the energetic dissipation and torquing of the BBH by gas gravitation and inertial forces. To probe the dependence of capture on the initial conditions, we discuss a suite of 345 simulations spanning local AGN disc density ($\rho_0$) and impact parameter ($b$) space. We identify a clear region in $b - \rho_0$ space where gas assisted BBH capture is efficient. We find that the presence of gas leads to strong energetic dissipation during close encounters between unbound BHs, forming stably bound eccentric BBHs. We find that the gas dissipation during close encounters increases for systems with increased disc density and deeper periapsis passages $r_p$, fitting a power law such that $\Delta E \propto \rho_0^{\alpha}r_p^{\beta}$ where $\{\alpha,\beta\} = \{1.01\pm0.04,-0.43\pm0.03\}$. Alternatively, the gas dissipation is approximately $\Delta E = 4.3 M_\text{d} v_\text{H} v_p$, where $M_\text{d} $ is the mass of a single BH minidisc just prior to the encounter when the binary separation is $2r_\text{H}$ (two binary Hill radii), $v_\text{H}$ and $v_p$ are the relative BH velocities at $2r_\text{H}$ and at the first closest approach, respectively. We derive a prescription for capture which can be used in semi-analytical models of AGN. We do not find the dissipative dynamics observed in these systems to be in agreement with the simple gas dynamical friction models often used in the literature.</description>

Abstract: By measuring photoelectron tracks, the gas pixel detectors of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite provide estimates of the photon detection location and its electric vector position angle (EVPA). However, imperfections in reconstructing event positions blur the image and EVPA-position correlations result in artificial polarized halos around bright sources. We introduce a new model describing this "polarization leakage" and use it to recover the on-orbit telescope point-spread functions, useful for faint source detection and image reconstruction. These point spread functions are more accurate than previous approximations or ground-calibrated products ($\Delta \chi^2\approx 3\times 10^{4}$ and $4 \times 10^4$ respectively for a bright $10^6$-count source). We also define an algorithm for polarization leakage correction substantially more accurate than existing prescriptions ($\Delta \chi^2\approx 1\times 10^{3}$). These corrections depend on the reconstruction method, and we supply prescriptions for the mission-standard "Moments" methods as well as for "Neural Net" event reconstruction. Finally, we present a method to isolate leakage contributions to polarization observations of extended sources and show that an accurate PSF allows the extraction of sub-PSF-scale polarization patterns.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for anisotropic interacting quark stars</title>

Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Systematic local simulations of fast neutrino flavor conversions with scattering effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs) in the one-dimensional (1D) and zero-dimensional (0D) models, in which spatial advection is considered and ignored, respectively. In this study, we employ snapshots obtained by our self-consistent, realistic Boltzmann-neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We show that the FFC growth rate is considerably larger in the 1D model than in the 0D model, as expected from the previous linear analysis results. We find that the momentum space dimension does not significantly influence the neutrino transition probability in 1D models. On the other hand, in the 0D model without collisions, the FFC depends on the momentum space, and the azimuthal angle dependence breaks the periodicity of the FFC. Our study demonstrates that collisional instability can lead to further flavor conversions on a long time scale in 1D models after the asymptotic state of FFC has been reached. Such an effect should be taken into consideration when the fast and collisional flavor instabilities coexist.</description>

      <title>Love-C relations for elastic hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to study matter under extreme densities. Recent observations from gravitational and electromagnetic waves have enabled constraints on NS properties, such as tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) and stellar compactness. Although each of these two NS observables depends strongly on the stellar internal structure, the relation between them (called the Love-C relation) is known to be equation-of-state insensitive. In this study, we investigate the effects of a possible crystalline phase in the core of hybrid stars (HSs) on the mass-radius and Love-C relations, where HSs are a subclass of NS models with a quark matter core and a nuclear matter envelope with a sharp phase transition in between. We find that both the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase as one increases the stiffness of the quark matter core controlled by the speed of sound, while the density discontinuity at the nuclear-quark matter transition effectively softens the equations of state. Deviations of the Love-C relation for elastic HSs from that of fluid NSs become more pronounced with a larger shear modulus, lower transition pressure, and larger density gap and can be as large as 60%. These findings suggest a potential method for testing the existence of distinct phases within HSs, though deviations are not large enough to be detected with current measurements of the tidal deformability and compactness.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. I. Linear response theory and stability conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-neutrino refraction leads to collective flavor evolution that can include fast flavor conversion, an ingredient still missing in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae. We provide a theoretical framework for the linear regime of this phenomenon using the language of response theory. In analogy to electromagnetic waves, we introduce a flavor susceptibility as the linear response to an external flavor field. By requiring self-consistency, this approach leads to the usual dispersion relation for growing modes, but differs from the traditional treatment in that it predicts Landau damping of subluminal collective modes. The new dispersion relation has definite analyticity properties and can be expanded for small growth rates. This approach simplifies and intuitively explains Morinaga's proof of sufficiency for the occurrence of growing modes. We show that weakly growing modes arise as soon as an angular crossing is formed, due to their resonant interaction with individual neutrino modes. For longitudinal plasma waves, a similar resonance causes Landau damping or conversely, the two-stream instability.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Annihilation to gamma-rays from SPT-SZ selected Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for dark matter annihilation from galaxy clusters in the energy range from 1-300 GeV using nearly 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. For this purpose, we use 350 galaxy clusters selected from the 2500 $\rm{deg^2}$ SPT-SZ survey. We model the dark matter distribution using the NFW profile for the main halo along with the Einasto profile for the substructure. The largest signal is seen for the cluster SPT-CL J2021-5257 with a significance of around $3\sigma$. The best-fit dark matter mass and annihilation cross-section for this cluster are equal to $(60.0 \pm 11.8)$ GeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle= (6.0 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-25} \rm{cm^3 s^{-1}}$ for the $\bar{b} b$ annihilation channel. However, this central estimate is in conflict with the limits on annihilation cross-section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and hence cannot be attributed to dark matter annihilation. Three other clusters show significance between $2-2.5\sigma$, whereas all the remaining clusters show null results. The most stringent 95\% c.l. upper limit for the WIMP annihilation cross-section among all the clusters is from SPT-CL J0455-4159, viz. $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 6.44 \times 10^{-26} \text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}$ for $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel.</description>

      <title>A millisecond pulsar position determined to 0.2 milliarcsecond precision with VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise millisecond pulsar (MSP) positions determined with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) hold the key to building the connection between the kinematic and dynamic reference frames respectively used by VLBI and pulsar timing. The frame connection would provide an important pathway to examining the planetary ephemerides used in pulsar timing, and potentially enhancing the sensitivities of pulsar timing arrays used to detect stochastic gravitational-wave background at nano-Hz regime. We aim at significantly improving the VLBI-based MSP position from its current $\gtrsim1\,$mas precision level by reducing the two dominant components in the positional uncertainty -- the propagation-related uncertainty and the uncertainty resulting from the frequency-dependent core shifts of the reference sources. We introduce a new differential astrometry strategy of using multiple calibrators observed at several widely separated frequencies, which we call PINPT (Phase-screen Interpolation plus frequeNcy-dePendent core shifT correction; read as "pinpoint") for brevity. The strategy allows determination of the core-shift and mitigates the impact of residual delay in the atmosphere. We implemented the strategy on PSR J2222-0137, an MSP well constrained astrometrically with VLBI and pulsar timing. Using the PINPT strategy, we determined core shifts for 4 AGNs around PSR J2222-0137, and derived a VLBI-based pulsar position with uncertainty of 0.17 mas and 0.32 mas in right ascension and declination, respectively, approaching the uncertainty level of the best-determined timing-based MSP positions. The realization of the PINPT strategy promises a factor-of-5 positional precision enhancement (over conventional VLBI astrometry) for all kinds of compact radio sources observed at $\lesssim2$ GHz, including most fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>XUV irradiation of young planetary atmospheres. Results from a joint XMM-Newton and HST observation of HIP67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines, that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0) star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations, including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar properties, that requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Metamorphosis of Positronium Moving Across a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positronium spectrum and lifetimes are known with a high precision. The situation is different for positronium moving across a magnetic field. The total momentum does not commute with the Hamiltonian and is replaced by conserved pseudomomentum. The internal dynamics is not separated from the motion of the system as a whole. The Coulomb potential well is distorted and a wide outer potential well is created. We analytically determine the energy spectrum for a broad range of the magnetic field and pseudomomentum values. We locate the region of these parameters for which the ground state resides in the outer well. The results may play a role in the suppression of pulsars radio emission (polar cap problem).</description>
