      <title>Stembridge codes, permutahedral varieties, and their extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Eulerian polynomial is the Hilbert series of the cohomology of the permutahedral variety. Stanley obtained a formula showing that the cohomology carries a permutation representation of $\S_n$. We answer a question of Stembridge on finding an explicit permutation basis of this cohomology. We observe that the Feichtner-Yuzvinsky basis for the Chow ring of the Boolean matroid is such a permutation basis, and then we construct an $\mathfrak{S}_n$-equivariant bijection between this basis and codes introduced by Stembridge, thereby giving a combinatorial proof of Stanley's formula. We obtain an analogous result for the stellahedral variety. We find a permutation basis of the permutation representation its cohomology carries. This involves the augmented Chow ring of a matroid introduced by Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot and Wang. Along the way, we obtain a general result on augmented Chow rings (which was also independently obtained by Eur) asserting that augmented Chow rings of matroids are actually Chow rings in the sense of Feichtner and Yuzvinsky. In the last part of the paper, we study enumerative aspects of the permutahedra and the stellohedra related to these permutation bases.</description>

      <title>Congruence invariants of matrix mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of R. Casals on binary invariants for matrix mutation, we study the matrix congruence relation on quasi-Cartan matrices. In particular, we obtain a classification and determine normal forms modulo 4. As an application, we obtain new mutation invariants, which include the one obtained by R. Casals.</description>

      <title>Some families of digraphs determined by the complementarity spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the capacity of the complementarity spectrum to distinguish non-isomorphic digraphs. We focus on the seven families with exactly three complementarity eigenvalues. Our findings reveal that in some, but not all families, any two non-isomorphic members have different complementarity spectrum. Complementarity eigenvalues outperform traditional eigenvalues in the task of identifying graphs. Indeed, the question of whether graphs are uniquely determined by their complementarity spectrum remains unresolved, highlighting the significance of this tool in graph theory. Moreover, since the complementarity spectrum of a digraph was characterized as the set of spectral radii of the induced strongly connected subdigraphs, the results of this study provides useful structural information for important families of digraphs.</description>

      <title>The Schur polynomials in all $n$th primitive roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Schur polynomials in all $n$th primitive roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. This result is reduced in turn to four propositions on the unimodularity of vector systems, and the last proposition is proved by using graph theory.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation and $P_3$-hull number in direct products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation is a graph infection process based on the update rule by which a vertex with $r$ infected neighbors becomes infected. We say that an initial set of infected vertices propagates if all vertices of a graph $G$ are eventually infected, and the minimum cardinality of such a set in $G$ is called the $r$-bootstrap percolation number, $m(G,r)$, of $G$. In this paper, we study percolating sets in direct products of graphs. While in general graphs there is no non-trivial upper bound on $m(G\times H,r)$, we prove several upper bounds under the assumption $\delta(G)\ge r$. We also characterize the connected graphs $G$ and $H$ with minimum degree $2$ that satisfy $m(G \times H, 2) = \frac{|V(G \times H)|}{2}$. In addition, we determine the exact values of $m(P_n \times P_m, 2)$, which are $m+n-1$ if $m$ and $n$ are of different parities, and $m+n$ otherwise.</description>

      <title>On extended perfect codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider extended $1$-perfect codes in Hamming graphs $H(n,q)$. Such nontrivial codes are known only when $n=2^k$, $k\geq 1$, $q=2$, or $n=q+2$, $q=2^m$, $m\geq 1$. Recently, Bespalov proved nonexistence of extended $1$-perfect codes for $q=3$, $4$, $n&gt;q+2$. In this work, we characterize all positive integers $n$, $r$ and prime $p$, for which there exist such a code in $H(n,p^r)$.</description>

      <title>Designs in finite classical polar spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial designs have been studied for nearly 200 years. 50 years ago, Cameron, Delsarte, and Ray-Chaudhury started investigating their $q$-analogs, also known as subspace designs or designs over finite fields.
  Designs can be defined analogously in finite classical polar spaces, too. The definition includes the $m$-regular systems from projective geometry as the special case where the blocks are generators of the polar space. The first nontrivial such designs for $t &gt; 1$ were found by De Bruyn and Vanhove in 2012, and some more designs appeared recently in the PhD thesis of Lansdown.
  In this article, we investigate the theory of classical and subspace designs for applicability to designs in polar spaces, explicitly allowing arbitrary block dimensions. In this way, we obtain divisibility conditions on the parameters, derived and residual designs, intersection numbers and an analog of Fisher's inequality. We classify the parameters of symmetric designs. Furthermore, we conduct a computer search to construct designs of strength $t=2$, resulting in designs for more than 140 previously unknown parameter sets in various classical polar spaces over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalised core partitions arising from affine Grassmannian elements in arbitrary Dynkin type. The corresponding notion of size is given by the atomic length in the sense of [CLG22]. In this paper, we first develop the theory for extended affine Weyl groups. In a series of applications, we give some remarkable parametrisations of the solutions of certain Diophantine equations resembling Pell's equation, by refining the results of [BN22] and [Alp14], and generalising them to further types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signed graph product is defined for a new product, and initially the unsigned graph product's Laplacian spectrum and signless Laplacian spectrum are found. Next, for the signed graph product, the adjacency spectrum, Laplacian spectrum, and signless Laplacian spectrum are found. In the end, we determined the prerequisite for the signed graph product to be integral and we also have generated a sequence of co-spectral signed graphs and a sequence of non-co-spectral equienergetic signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Tight minimum degree conditions for apex-outerplanar minors and subdivisions in graphs and digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Hadwiger's conjecture and related problems for list-coloring, we study graphs $H$ for which every graph with minimum degree at least $|V(H)|-1$ contains $H$ as a minor. We prove that a large class of apex-outerplanar graphs satisfies this property. Our result gives the first examples of such graphs whose vertex cover numbers are significantly larger than half of the number of its vertices, which breaks a barrier for attacking related coloring problems via extremal functions, and recovers all known such graphs that have arbitrarily large maximum degree. Our proof can be adapted to directed graphs to show that if $\vec H$ is the digraph obtained from a directed cycle or an in-arborescence by adding an apex source, then every digraph with minimum out-degree $|V(\vec H)|-1$ contains $\vec H$ as a subdivision or a butterfly minor respectively. These results provide the optimal upper bound for the chromatic number and dichromatic number of graphs and digraphs that do not contain the aforementioned graphs or digraphs as a minor, butterfly minor and a subdivision, respectively. Special cases of our results solve an open problem of Aboulker, Cohen, Havet, Lochet, Moura and Thomass\'{e} and strengthen results of Gishboliner, Steiner and Szab\'{o}.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds of the Odd Chromatic Number of a Graph in terms of its Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An odd coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper vertex coloring $\varphi$ with the property that for each non-isolated vertex $v\in V(G)$, there exists a color $c$ such that the cardinality of $\varphi^{-1}(c)\cap N(v)$ is odd. The concept of odd colorings is introduced by Petru\v{s}evski and \v{S}krekovski. In this paper, we investigate upper bounds of the odd chromatic number of a graph in terms of its thickness and other graphical parameters. In particular, we show that a graph $G$ with the minimum degree at least $2\theta(G)-1$ and girth at least $6$ is odd $6\theta(G)$-colorable, where $\theta(G)$ is the thickness of $G$.</description>

      <title>Truncated theta series from the Bailey lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Andrews and Merca obtained a truncated version of Euler's pentagonal number theorem and showed the nonnegativity related to partition functions. Meanwhile, Andrews-Merca and Guo-Zeng independently conjectured that the truncated Jacobi triple product series has nonnegative coefficients, which has been confirmed analytically and also combinatorially. In 2022, Merca proposed a stronger version for this conjecture. In this paper, by applying Agarwal, Andrews and Bressoud's Bailey lattice, we derive a truncated version for the Jacobi triple product series with odd basis which reduces to the Andrews-Gordon identity as a special instance. As consequences, we obtain new truncated forms for Euler's pentagonal number theorem, Gauss'theta series on triangular numbers and square numbers, which lead to inequalities for certain partition functions. Moreover, by considering a truncated theta series involving $\ell$-regular partitions, we confirm a conjecture proposed by Ballantine and Merca about 6-regular partitions and show that Merca's stronger conjecture on truncated Jacobi triple product series holds when $R = 3S$ for $S \geq 1.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The packing of three copies of a graph $G$ is the union of three edge-disjoint copies (with the same vertex set) of $G$. In this paper, we completely solve the problem of the uniqueness of packing of three copies of 2-regular graphs. In particular, we show that $C_3,C_4,C_5,C_6$ and $2C_3$ have no packing of three copies, $C_7,C_8,C_3 \cup C_4, C_4 \cup C_4, C_3 \cup C_5$ and $3C_3$ have unique packing, and any other collection of cycles has at least two distinct packings.</description>

      <title>The Real Tropical Geometry of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a binary classifier defined as the sign of a tropical rational function, that is, as the difference of two convex piecewise linear functions. The parameter space of ReLU neural networks is contained as a semialgebraic set inside the parameter space of tropical rational functions. We initiate the study of two different subdivisions of this parameter space: a subdivision into semialgebraic sets, on which the combinatorial type of the decision boundary is fixed, and a subdivision into a polyhedral fan, capturing the combinatorics of the partitions of the dataset. The sublevel sets of the 0/1-loss function arise as subfans of this classification fan, and we show that the level-sets are not necessarily connected. We describe the classification fan i) geometrically, as normal fan of the activation polytope, and ii) combinatorially through a list of properties of associated bipartite graphs, in analogy to covector axioms of oriented matroids and tropical oriented matroids. Our findings extend and refine the connection between neural networks and tropical geometry by observing structures established in real tropical geometry, such as positive tropicalizations of hypersurfaces and tropical semialgebraic sets.</description>

      <title>Paintability of $r$-chromatic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paintability of a graph is a coloring parameter defined in terms of an online list coloring game. In this paper we ask, what is the paintability of a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ and chromatic number $r$? By considering the Alon-Tarsi number of $G$, we prove that the paintability of $G$ is at most $\left(1 - \frac{1}{4r+1} \right ) \Delta + 2$. We also consider the DP-paintability of $G$, which is defined in terms of an online DP-coloring game. By considering the strict type $3$ degeneracy parameter recently introduced by Zhou, Zhu, and Zhu, we show that when $r$ is fixed and $\Delta$ is sufficiently large, the DP-paintability of $G$ is at most $\Delta - \Omega( \sqrt{\Delta \log \Delta})$.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that every noncompact surface has a (3,6)-tight triangulation, and a characterisation of such triangulations is given in terms of length constraints on the boundary walks of superfaces of a given genus. Applications are given to the generic rigidity of associated countable bar-joint frameworks in R^3. In particular, every noncompact surface has a (3,6)-tight triangulation that is minimally 3-rigid. A proof of Ker\'ekj\'art\'o's classification of noncompact surfaces is also given.</description>

Abstract: We consider three extremal problems about the number of copies of a fixed graph in another larger graph. First, we correct an error in a result of Reiher and Wagner and prove that the number of $k$-edge stars in a graph with density $x \in [0, 1]$ is asymptotically maximized by a clique and isolated vertices or its complement. Next, among ordered $n$-vertex graphs with $m$ edges, we determine the maximum and minimum number of copies of a $k$-edge star whose nonleaf vertex is minimum among all vertices of the star. Finally, for $s \ge 2$, we define a particular $3$-edge-colored complete graph $F$ on $2s$ vertices with colors blue, green and red, and determine, for each $(x_b, x_g)$ with $x_b+x_g\le 1$ and $x_b, x_g \ge 0$, the maximum density of $F$ in a large graph whose blue, green and red edge sets have densities $x_b, x_g$ and $1-x_b-x_g$, respectively. These are the first nontrivial examples of colored graphs for which such complete results are proved.</description>

Abstract: For an infinite set M of natural numbers, let FS(M) be the set of all nonzero finite sums of distinct numbers in M. An IP set is any set of the form FS(M). Let p_n denote the n-th prime number for each $n \ge 1$. A de Polignac number is any number m such that $p_{n+1}-p_n=m$ for infinitely many n. In this note, we show that every IP set of even natural numbers contains infinitely many de Polignac numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using new combinatorics of Young walls, we give a new construction of the arbitrary level highest weight crystal $B(\lambda)$ for the quantum affine algebras of types $A^{(2)}_{2n}$, $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, $A^{(2)}_{2n-1}$, $D^{(1)}_n$, $B^{(1)}_n$ and $C^{(1)}_n$. We show that the crystal consisting of reduced Young walls is isomorphic to the crystal $B(\lambda)$. Moreover, we provide a new realization of the crystal $B(\infty)$ in terms of reduced virtual Young walls and reduced extended Young walls.</description>

Abstract: We associate a symmetric quiver with relations Q to any seed of a cluster algebra of type B and C. Under this correspondence, cluster variables of type B (resp. C) correspond to orthogonal (resp. symplectic) indecomposable representations of Q. We find a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting. We also give a categorical interpretation of the cluster expansion formula in the case of acyclic quivers.</description>

      <title>Complements of Schubert polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.03922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ be the Schubert polynomial for a permutation $w$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. For any given composition $\mu$, we say that $x^\mu \mathfrak{S}_w(x^{-1})$ is the complement of $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ with respect to $\mu$. When each part of $\mu$ is equal to $n-1$, Huh, Matherne, M\'esz\'aros and St.\,Dizier proved that the normalization of $x^\mu \mathfrak{S}_w(x^{-1})$ is a Lorentzian polynomial. They further conjectured that the normalization of $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ is Lorentzian. It can be shown that if there exists a composition $\mu$ such that $x^\mu \mathfrak{S}_w(x^{-1})$ is a Schubert polynomial, then the normalization of $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ will be Lorentzian. This motivates us to investigate the problem of when $x^\mu \mathfrak{S}_w(x^{-1})$ is a Schubert polynomial. We show that if $x^\mu \mathfrak{S}_w(x^{-1})$ is a Schubert polynomial, then $\mu$ must be a partition. We also consider the case when $\mu$ is the staircase partition $\delta_n=(n-1,\ldots, 1,0)$, and obtain that $x^{\delta_n} \mathfrak{S}_w(x^{-1})$ is a Schubert polynomial if and only if $w$ avoids the patterns 132 and 312. A conjectured characterization of when $x^\mu \mathfrak{S}_w(x^{-1})$ is a Schubert polynomial is proposed.</description>

Abstract: Let $0&lt;k\in\mathbb{Z}$. Let the star 2-set transposition graph $ST^2_k$ be the $(2k-1)$-regular graph whose vertices are the $2k$-strings on $k$ symbols, each symbol repeated twice, with its edges given each by the transposition of the initial entry of one such $2k$-string with any entry that contains a different symbol than that of the initial entry. The pancake 2-set transposition graph $PC^2_k$ has the same vertex set of $ST^2_k$ and its edges involving each the maximal product of concentric disjoint transpositions in any prefix of an endvertex string, including the external transposition being that of an edge of $ST^2_k$. For $1&lt;k\in\mathbb{Z}$, we show that $ST^2_k$ and $PC^2_k$, among other intermediate transposition graphs, have total colorings via $2k-1$ colors. They, in turn, yield efficient dominating sets, or E-sets, of the vertex sets of $ST^2_k$ and $PC^2_k$, and partitions into into $2k-1$ such E-sets, generalizing Dejter-Serra work on E-sets in such graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06974v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By an $r$-tuplet in a permutation we mean a family of $r$ pairwise disjoint subsequences with the same relative order. The length of an $r$-tuplet is defined as the length of any single subsequence in the family. Let $t^{(r)}(n)$ denote the largest $k$ such that every permutation of length $n$ contains an $r$-tuplet of length $k$. We prove that $t^{(r)}(n)=O\left(n^{\frac r{2r-1}}\right)$ and $t^{(r)}(n)=\Omega\left( n^{\frac{R}{2R-1}} \right)$, where $R=\binom{2r-1}r$. We conjecture that the upper bound brings the correct order of magnitude of $t^{(r)}(n)$ and support this conjecture by proving that it holds for almost all permutations. Our work generalizes previous studies of the case $r=2$.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the complex Grassmannian of $k$-dimensional subspaces can be identified with the set of projection matrices of rank $k$. It is also classically known that the convex hull of this set is the set of Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues between $0$ and $1$ and summing to $k$. We give a new proof of this fact. We also give an existence theorem for a certain combinatorial class of hypermatrices by a similar argument. This existence theorem can be rewritten into an existence theorem for a uniform weighted hypergraph with given weighted degree sequence.</description>

Abstract: We define oriented posets with correpsonding rank matrices, where linking two posets by an edge corresponds to matrix multiplication. In particular, linking chains via this method gives us fence posets, and taking traces gives us circular fence posets. As an application, we give a combinatorial model for $q$-deformed Markov numbers. We also resolve a conjecture of Leclere and Morier-Genoud and give several identities between circular rank polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04855v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a canonical way to decompose finite graphs into highly connected local parts. The decomposition depends only on an integer parameter whose choice sets the intended degree of locality. The global structure of the graph, as determined by the relative position of these parts, is described by a coarser $\it model$. This is a simpler graph determined entirely by the decomposition, not imposed.
  The model and decomposition are obtained as projections of the tangle-tree structure of a covering of the given graph that reflects its local structure while unfolding its global structure. In this way, the tangle theory from graph minors is brought to bear canonically on arbitrary graphs, which need not be tree-like.
  Our theorem extends to locally finite quasi-transitive graphs, and in particular to locally finite Cayley graphs. It thereby offers a canonical decomposition for finitely generated groups into local parts, whose relative structure is displayed by a graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi_n$ be a uniformly chosen random permutation on $[n]$. Using an analysis of the probability that two overlapping consecutive $k$-permutations are order isomorphic, the authors of a recent paper showed that the expected number of distinct consecutive patterns of all lengths $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ in $\pi_n$ is $\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))$ as $n\to\infty$. This exhibited the fact that random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly. We use entirely different methods, namely the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation, to reprove and slightly improve their result.</description>

Abstract: We consider the monomial expansion of the $q$-Whittaker and modified Hall-Littlewood polynomialsarising from specialization of the modified Macdonald polynomial. The two combinatorial formulas for the latter due to Haglund, Haiman, and Loehr and Ayyer, Mandelshtam and Martin give rise to two different parameterizing sets in each case. We produce bijections between the parameterizing sets which preserve the content and major index statistics. We identify the major index with the charge or cocharge of appropriate words and use descriptions of the latter due to Lascoux-Sch$\ddot{\text{u}}$tzenberger and Killpatrick to show that our bijections have the desired properties.</description>

      <title>Induced Tur\'an problem in bipartite graphs</title>

Abstract: The classical extremal function for a graph $H$, $ex(K_n, H)$ is the largest number of edges in a subgraph of $K_n$ that contains no subgraph isomorphic to $H$. Note that defining $ex(K_n, H-ind)$ by forbidding induced subgraphs isomorphic to $H$ is not very meaningful for a non-complete $H$ since one can avoid it by considering a clique.
  For graphs $F$ and $H$, let $ex(K_n, \{F, H-ind\})$ be the largest number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that contains no subgraph isomorphic to $F$ and no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$. Determining this function asymptotically reduces to finding either $ex(K_n, F)$ or $ex(K_n, H)$, unless $H$ is a biclique or both $F$ and $H$ are bipartite. Here, we consider the bipartite setting, $ex(K_{n,n}, \{F, H-ind\})$ when $K_n$ is replaced with $K_{n,n}$, $F$ is a biclique, and $H$ is a bipartite graph.
  Our main result, a strengthening of a result by Sudakov and Tomon, implies that for any $d\geq 2$ and any $K_{d,d}$-free bipartite graph $H$ with each vertex in one part of degree either at most $d$ or a full degree, so that there are at most $d-2$ full degree vertices in that part, one has $ex(K_{n,n}, \{K_{t,t}, H-ind\}) = o(n^{2-1/d})$. This provides an upper bound on the induced Tur\'an number for a wide class of bipartite graphs and implies in particular an extremal result for bipartite graphs of bounded VC-dimension by Janzer and Pohoata.</description>

      <title>Product Mixing in Compact Lie Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15456v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is a group, we say a subset $S$ of $G$ is product-free if the equation $xy=z$ has no solutions with $x,y,z \in S$. For $D \in \mathbb{N}$, a group $G$ is said to be $D$-quasirandom if the minimal dimension of a nontrivial complex irreducible representation of $G$ is at least $D$. Gowers showed that in a $D$-quasirandom finite group $G$, the maximal size of a product-free set is at most $|G|/D^{1/3}$. This disproved a longstanding conjecture of Babai and S\'os from 1985.
  For the special unitary group, $G=SU(n)$, Gowers observed that his argument yields an upper bound of $n^{-1/3}$ on the measure of a measurable product-free subset. In this paper, we improve Gowers' upper bound to $\exp(-cn^{1/3})$, where $c&gt;0$ is an absolute constant. In fact, we establish something stronger, namely, product-mixing for measurable subsets of $SU(n)$ with measure at least $\exp(-cn^{1/3})$; for this product-mixing result, the $n^{1/3}$ in the exponent is sharp.
  Our approach involves introducing novel hypercontractive inequalities, which imply that the non-Abelian Fourier spectrum of the indicator function of a small set concentrates on high-dimensional irreducible representations.
  Our hypercontractive inequalities are obtained via methods from representation theory, harmonic analysis, random matrix theory and differential geometry. We generalize our hypercontractive inequalities from $SU(n)$ to an arbitrary $D$-quasirandom compact connected Lie group for $D$ at least an absolute constant, thereby extending our results on product-free sets to such groups.
  We also demonstrate various other applications of our inequalities to geometry (viz., non-Abelian Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities), mixing times, and the theory of growth in compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>On the length of directed paths in digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thomass\'{e} conjectured the following strengthening of the well-known Caccetta-Haggkvist Conjecture: any digraph with minimum out-degree $\delta$ and girth $g$ contains a directed path of length $\delta(g-1)$. Bai and Manoussakis gave counterexamples to Thomass\'{e}'s conjecture for every even $g\geq 4$. In this note, we first generalize their counterexamples to show that Thomass\'{e}'s conjecture is false for every $g\geq 4$. We also obtain the positive result that any digraph with minimum out-degree $\delta$ and girth $g$ contains a directed path of $2\delta(1-\frac{1}{g})$. For small $g$ we obtain better bounds, e.g. for $g=3$ we show that oriented graph with minimum out-degree $\delta$ contains a directed path of length $1.5\delta$. Furthermore, we show that each $d$-regular digraph with girth $g$ contains a directed path of length $\Omega(dg/\log d)$. Our results give the first non-trivial bounds for these problems.</description>

      <title>Zig-zag Eulerian polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any finite partially ordered set $P$, the $P$-Eulerian polynomial is the generating function for the descent number over the set of linear extensions of $P$, and is closely related to the order polynomial of $P$ arising in the theory of $P$-partitions. Here we study the $P$-Eulerian polynomial where $P$ is a naturally labeled zig-zag poset; we call these zig-zag Eulerian polynomials. A result of Br\"and\'en implies that these polynomials are gamma-nonnegative, and hence their coefficients are symmetric and unimodal. The zig-zag Eulerian polynomials and the associated order polynomials have appeared fleetingly in the literature in a wide variety of contexts$\unicode{x2014}$e.g., in the study of polytopes, magic labelings of graphs, and Kekul\'e structures$\unicode{x2014}$but they do not appear to have been studied systematically.
  In this paper, we use a "relaxed" version of $P$-partitions to both survey and unify results. Our technique shows that the zig-zag Eulerian polynomials also capture the distribution of "big returns" over the set of (up-down) alternating permutations, as first observed by Coons and Sullivant. We develop recurrences for refined versions of the relevant generating functions, which evoke similarities to recurrences for the classical Eulerian polynomials. We conclude with a literature survey and open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.00896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the R\'enyi entropy of independent sums of integer valued random variables through Fourier theoretic means, and give sharp comparisons between the variance and the R\'enyi entropy, for Poisson-Bernoulli variables. As applications we prove that a discrete ``min-entropy power'' is super additive on independent variables up to a universal constant, and give new bounds on an entropic generalization of the Littlewood-Offord problem that are sharp in the ``Poisson regime''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00879v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a lecture on the theory of formal power series developed entirely without any analytic machinery. Combining ideas from various authors we are able to prove Newton's binomial theorem, Jacobi's triple product, the Rogers--Ramanujan identities and many other prominent results. We apply these methods to derive several combinatorial theorems including Ramanujan's partition congruences, generating functions of Stirling numbers and Jacobi's four-square theorem. We further discuss formal Laurent series and multivariate power series and end with a proof of MacMahon's master theorem.</description>

Abstract: We classify all unicycle graphs whose edge-binomials form a $d$-sequence, particularly linear type binomial edge ideals. We also classify unicycle graphs whose parity edge-binomials form a $d$-sequence.

      <description>arXiv:2210.03617v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distributions of waiting times in variations of the negative binomial distribution of order $k$. One variation apply different enumeration scheme on the runs of successes. Another case considers binary trials for which the probability of ones is geometrically varying. We investigate the exact distribution of the waiting time for the $r$-th occurrence of success run of a specified length (non-overlapping, overlapping, at least, exactly, $\ell$-overlapping) in a $q$-sequence of binary trials. The main theorems are Type $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$ $q$-negative binomial distribution of order $k$ and $q$-negative binomial distribution of order $k$ in the $\ell$-overlapping case. In the present work, we consider a sequence of independent binary zero and one trials with not necessarily identical distribution with the probability of ones varying according to a geometric rule. Exact formulae for the distributions obtained by means of enumerative combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a mathematical and statistical point of view, a segment of a DNA strand can be viewed as a sequence of four-state (A, C, G, T) trials. We consider distributions of runs and patterns related to run lengths of multi-state sequences, especially for four states (A, B, C, D). Let $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots$ be a sequence of four state i.i.d.\ trials taking values in the set $\mathscr{S}=\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D\}$ of four symbols with probability $P(A)=P_{a}$, $P(B)=P_{b}$, $P(C)=P_{c}$ and $P(D)=P_{d},$ respectively. In this paper, we obtain exact formulae for the probability distribution function for runs of B's the discrete distribution of order $k$, longest run statistics, shortest run statistics, waiting time distribution and the distribution of run lengths.</description>

      <title>The weighted total cophenetic index: A novel balance index for phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks play an important role in evolutionary biology as, other than phylogenetic trees, they can be used to accommodate reticulate evolutionary events such as horizontal gene transfer and hybridization. Recent research has provided a lot of progress concerning the reconstruction of such networks from data as well as insight into their graph theoretical properties. However, methods and tools to quantify structural properties of networks or differences between them are still very limited. For example, for phylogenetic trees, it is common to use balance indices to draw conclusions concerning the underlying evolutionary model, and more than twenty such indices have been proposed and are used for different purposes. One of the most frequently used balance index for trees is the so-called total cophenetic index, which has several mathematically and biologically desirable properties. For networks, on the other hand, balance indices are to-date still scarce.
  In this contribution, we introduce the \textit{weighted} total cophenetic index as a generalization of the total cophenetic index for trees to make it applicable to general phylogenetic networks. As we shall see, this index can be determined efficiently and behaves in a mathematical sound way, i.e., it satisfies so-called locality and recursiveness conditions. In addition, we analyze its extremal properties and, in particular, we investigate its maxima and minima as well as the structure of networks that achieve these values within the space of so-called level-$1$ networks. We finally briefly compare this novel index to the two other network balance indices available so-far.</description>

Abstract: The real Grassmannian is both a projective variety (via Pl\"ucker coordinates) and an affine variety (via orthogonal projections). We connect these two representations, and we develop the commutative algebra of the latter variety. We introduce the squared Grassmannian, and we study applications to determinantal point processes in statistics.</description>

      <title>Construction of CCC and ZCCS Through Additive Characters Over Galois Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progression in wireless communication technologies, especially in multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA), there is a need of advanced code construction methods. Traditional approaches, mainly based on generalized Boolean functions, have limitations in code length versatility. This paper introduces a novel approach to constructing complete complementary codes (CCC) and Z-complementary code sets (ZCCS), for reducing interference in MC-CDMA systems. The proposed construction, distinct from Boolean function-based approaches, employs additive characters over Galois fields GF($p^{r}$), where $p$ is prime and $r$ is a positive integer. First, we develop CCCs with lengths of $p^{r}$, which are then extended to construct ZCCS with both unreported lengths and sizes of $np^{r}$, where $n$ are arbitrary positive integers. The versatility of this method is further highlighted as it includes the lengths of ZCCS reported in prior studies as special cases, underscoring the method's comprehensive nature and superiority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cactus graph is a connected graph in which every block is either an edge or a cycle. In this paper, we will examine cactus graphs where all the blocks are $3$-cycles, i.e., triangular cactus graphs, of diameter $4$. Our main focus is to prove that the corresponding edge ring of this family of graphs is not normal and satisfies Serre's condition $(S_2)$. We use a criterion due to Katth\"an for non-normal affine semigroup rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give sharp bounds in Breuillard, Green and Tao's finitary version of Gromov's theorem on groups with polynomial growth. Precisely, we show that for every non-negative integer d there exists $c=c(d)&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is a group with finite symmetric generating set $S$ containing the identity and $|S^n|\le cn^{d+1}|S|$ for some positive integer $n$ then there exist normal subgroups $H\le\Gamma\le G$ such that $H\subseteq S^n$, such that $\Gamma/H$ is $d$-nilpotent (i.e. has a central series of length $d$ with cyclic factors), and such that $[G:\Gamma]\le g(d)$, where $g(d)$ denotes the maximum order of a finite subgroup of $GL_d(\mathbb{Z})$. The bounds on both the nilpotence and index are sharp; the previous best bounds were $O(d)$ on the nilpotence, and an ineffective function of $d$ on the index. In fact, we obtain this as a small part of a much more detailed fine-scale description of the structure of $G$. These results have a wide range of applications in various aspects of the theory of vertex-transitive graphs: percolation theory, random walks, structure of finite groups, scaling limits of finite vertex-transitive graphs.... We obtain some of these applications in the present paper, and treat others in companion papers. Some are due to or joint with other authors.</description>

      <title>Eight-Partitioning Points in 3D, and Efficiently Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An \emph{eight-partition} of a finite set of points (respectively, of a continuous mass distribution) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of three planes that divide the space into $8$ octants, such that each open octant contains at most $1/8$ of the points (respectively, of the mass). In 1966, Hadwiger showed that any mass distribution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition; moreover, one can prescribe the normal direction of one of the three planes. The analogous result for finite point sets follows by a standard limit argument.
  We prove the following variant of this result: Any mass distribution (or point set) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition for which the intersection of two of the planes is a line with a prescribed direction.
  Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating an eight-partition of a set of $n$ points in~$\mathbb{R}^3$ (with prescribed normal direction of one of the planes) in time $O^{*}(n^{5/2})$.</description>

      <title>Line defect half-indices of $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Wilson line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons theories of level $k\le -N$ with Neumann boundary conditions for the gauge fields, together with 2d Fermi multiplets and fundamental 3d chiral multiplets to cancel the gauge anomaly. We derive some exact results and also make some conjectures based on expansions of the $q$-series. We find several interesting connections with special functions known in the literature, including Rogers-Ramanujan functions for which we conjecture integral representations, and the appearance of Appell-Lerch sums for certain Wilson line half-index grand canonical ensembles which reveal an unexpected appearance of mock modular functions. We also find intriguing $q$-difference equations relating half-indices to Wilson line half-indices. Some of these results also have a description in terms of a dual theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the vector multiplet in the dual theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration $\mathcal{I}=\{I_{[k]}\}_{k\ge0}$ is introduced. Under the assumption that $\mathcal{I}$ is Noetherian, we prove that the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(I_{[k]})$ is an eventually quasi-linear function. This result applies to several situations, including ordinary powers, and integral closures of ordinary powers, among others. As another application, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain integer programming problems. Finally, we present the Macaulay2 package $\texttt{VNumber}$.</description>
