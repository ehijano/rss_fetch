      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram that maps the competitive interplay between the unstable tongues of parametric resonance and the intrinsic Jeans instability. The diagram reveals that increasing the driving frequency compresses the Jeans-unstable region and allows well-separated parametric resonance tongues to dominate, thereby creating a clear regime for observing Faraday waves. Conversely, lowering the driving frequency expands the domain of Jeans instability, which fragments and overwhelms the parametric resonance structures. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal a characteristic transition from parametric-resonance-driven Faraday waves to gravity-dominated Jeans collapse as the Jeans frequency increases.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

Abstract: We investigate the formation of novel moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer-atomic interactions. By introducing the density wave amplitude, we divide the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes at each stage. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is closely linked to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. The patterns exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting potential applications of this strongly frequency-dependent pattern formation in quantum precision measurement. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>

Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>
