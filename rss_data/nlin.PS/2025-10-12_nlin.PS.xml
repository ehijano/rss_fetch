      <title>Hubbard-like Interactions and Emergent Dynamical Regimes Between Modulational Instability and Self-Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the modulational instability of uniform wave packets governed by a discrete third-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in finite square lattices, modeling light propagation in two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. We analyze how initially stable uniform distributions evolve into self-trapped (localized) regimes and the influence of a refractive index detuning selectively applied along the diagonal waveguides on this transition. This detuning effectively emulates the effect of on-site Hubbard-like interactions $U$ in photonic analogs of interacting particles in a one-dimensional lattice. While for $U = 0$ the system exhibits the known direct transition from stable uniform states to asymptotically localized profiles, we show that $U &gt; 0$ induces an emergence of intermediate dynamical regimes. These regimes include coherent breathing modes that can be either confined along diagonal or off-diagonal waveguides, as well as chaotic-like propagation patterns. At higher nonlinearities, we identify distinct self-trapped regimes characterized by diagonal or off-diagonal localized modes, depending on the strength of $U$. The critical nonlinear strengths separating the existing regimes are shown in the phase diagram, underscoring the competing trends imposed by the Hubbard-like interaction on the optical field.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Models for Two Nonreciprocally Coupled Fields: A Microscopic Derivation for Zero, One, and Two Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for several cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. Only allowing for single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, only accounting for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Moreover, combining the different dynamics gives a large number of further models. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves in extended Gross-Pitaevskii Models with a Lee-Huang-Yang correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.</description>
