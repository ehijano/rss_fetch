      <title>Linear scaling causal discovery from high-dimensional time series by dynamical community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding which parts of a dynamical system cause each other is extremely relevant in fundamental and applied sciences. However, inferring causal links from observational data, namely without direct manipulations of the system, is still computationally challenging, especially if the data are high-dimensional. In this study we introduce a framework for constructing causal graphs from high-dimensional time series, whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of variables. The approach is based on the automatic identification of dynamical communities, groups of variables which mutually influence each other and can therefore be described as a single node in a causal graph. These communities are efficiently identified by optimizing the Information Imbalance, a statistical quantity that assigns a weight to each putative causal variable based on its information content relative to a target variable. The communities are then ordered starting from the fully autonomous ones, whose evolution is independent from all the others, to those that are progressively dependent on other communities, building in this manner a community causal graph. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and the accuracy of our approach on time-discrete and time-continuous dynamical systems including up to 80 variables.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in Schmitt trigger and its application towards weak signal detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores stochastic resonance (SR) in a Schmitt trigger circuit and its application to weak signal detection. SR, a phenomenon where noise synchronizes with weak signals to enhance detectability, was demonstrated using a custom-designed bi-stable Schmitt trigger system. The circuit's bi-stability was validated through hysteresis curve analysis, confirming its suitability for SR studies. Experimental results revealed SR behavior by analyzing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) responses to noise amplitude variations. Detection experiments were conducted to determine frequency and amplitude of damping sinusoidal pulses. Frequency detection proved effective, albeit with limitations at low frequencies, while amplitude detection faced challenges due to mathematical complexities. Nonetheless, the study highlights SR's potential for weak signal detection, with proposed enhancements to improve detection accuracy. This work underscores the adaptability of classical SR principles to practical detection systems and suggests future applications in advanced detection technologies, including quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Observing cities as a complex system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities are some of the most intricate and advanced creations of humanity. Most objects in cities are perfectly synchronised to coordinate activities like jobs, education, transportation, entertainment or waste management. Although each city has its characteristics, some commonalities can be observed across most cities, like issues related to noise, pollution, segregation and others. Further, some of these issues might be accentuated in larger or smaller cities. For example, with more people, a city might experience more competition for space so rents would be higher. The urban scaling theory gives a framework to analyse cities in the context of their size. New data for analysing urban scaling theory allow an understanding of how urban metrics change with their population size, whether they apply across most regions or if patterns correspond only to some country or region. Yet, reducing a city and all its complexity into a single indicator might simplify urban areas to an extent where their disparities and variations are overlooked. Often, the differences between the living conditions in different parts of the same city are bigger than the degree of variation observed between cities. For example, in terms of rent or crime, within-city variations might be more significant than between cities. Here, we review some urban scaling principles and explore ways to analyse variations within the same city.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Interventional Causality into Synergistic, Redundant, and Unique Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for decomposing interventional causal effects into synergistic, redundant, and unique components, building on the intuition of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and the principle of M\"obius inversion. While recent work has explored a similar decomposition of an observational measure, we argue that a proper causal decomposition must be interventional in nature. We develop a mathematical approach that systematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a system, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the M\"obius function of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by decomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, and chemical reaction networks. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can be context- and parameter-dependent. This decomposition provides new insights into complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined among multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution of responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological networks or climate models.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo scheme for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) with any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as a ratio of generalized partition functions, we prove that it can be simulated by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space. This allows for straightforward computation of the values and derivatives of $\alpha$-SRE using techniques such as reweight-annealing and thermodynamic integration. Moreover, our approach separates the free energy contribution in $\alpha$-SRE, thus the contribution solely from the characteristic function can be studied, which is directly tied to magic. In our applications to the ground states of 1D and 2D transverse field Ising (TFI) model, we reveal that the behavior of $2$-SRE is governed by the interplay between the characteristic function and the free energy contributions, with singularities hidden in both of their derivatives at quantum critical points. This indicates that $\alpha$-SRE does not necessarily exhibit a peak at the quantum critical point for a general many-body system. We also study the volume-law corrections to the ground-state magic. These corrections slightly violate the strict volume law and suggest discontinuity at quantum critical points, which we attribute to the abrupt change of the ground-state magical structure. Our findings suggest that volume-law corrections of magic are stronger diagnostics for criticalities than the full-state magic. Lastly, we study the finite-temperature phase transition of the 2D TFI model, where the $2$-SRE is not a well-defined magic measure. The nonphysical results we obtain also prove the ineffectiveness of $2$-SRE for mixed states. Our method enables scalable and efficient evaluation of $\alpha$-SRE in large-scale quantum systems, providing a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Physics of Skill Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to understand physics of skill learning, i.e., how skills are learned in neural networks during training. We start by observing the Domino effect, i.e., skills are learned sequentially, and notably, some skills kick off learning right after others complete learning, similar to the sequential fall of domino cards. To understand the Domino effect and relevant behaviors of skill learning, we take physicists' approach of abstraction and simplification. We propose three models with varying complexities -- the Geometry model, the Resource model, and the Domino model, trading between reality and simplicity. The Domino effect can be reproduced in the Geometry model, whose resource interpretation inspires the Resource model, which can be further simplified to the Domino model. These models present different levels of abstraction and simplification; each is useful to study some aspects of skill learning. The Geometry model provides interesting insights into neural scaling laws and optimizers; the Resource model sheds light on the learning dynamics of compositional tasks; the Domino model reveals the benefits of modularity. These models are not only conceptually interesting -- e.g., we show how Chinchilla scaling laws can emerge from the Geometry model, but also are useful in practice by inspiring algorithmic development -- e.g., we show how simple algorithmic changes, motivated by these toy models, can speed up the training of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments, gains acceleration on GPUs and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs with jumbo-charge outputs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the long-serving method of waveform integration.</description>

      <title>Information-driven design of imaging systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most modern imaging systems process the data they capture computationally, either to make the measurement more interpretable for human viewing or to analyze it without a human in the loop. As a result, what matters is not how measurements appear visually, but how much information they contain. Information theory provides mathematical tools to quantify this; however, it has found limited use in imaging system design due to the challenge of developing methods that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating the information content of imaging system measurements in order to evaluate system performance and optimize designs. Our framework requires only a dataset of experimental measurements and a means for noise characterization, enabling its use in real systems without ground truth data. We validate that these information estimates reliably predict system performance across diverse imaging modalities, including color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and label-free microscopy. We further introduce an optimization technique called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) for designing imaging systems that maximize information capture. This work unlocks information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks as a tool for epileptic seizures forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</description>
