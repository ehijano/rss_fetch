      <title>Graded Index Couplers for Next Generation Chip-to-Chip and Fiber-to-Chip Photonic Packaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition towards designs which co-package electronic and photonic die together in data center switch packages has created a scaling path to Petabyte per second (Pbps) input/output (I/O) in such systems. In a co-packaged design, the scaling of bandwidth, cost, and energy will be governed by the number of optical I/O channels and the data rate per channel. While optical communication provide an opportunity to exploit wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to scale data rate, the limited 127 $\mu$m pitch of V-groove based single mode fiber arrays and the use of active alignment and bonding for their packaging present challenges to scaling the number of optical channels. Flip-chip optical couplers which allow for low loss, broadband operation and automated passive assembly represent a solution for continued scaling. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to vertically couple between silicon based waveguides on separate chips using graded index (GRIN) couplers in combination with an evanescent coupler. Simulation results using a 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) solver are presented, demonstrating coupling losses below 0.27 dB for a chip-to-chip gap of 11 $\mu$m; 1-dB vertical and lateral alignment tolerances of approximately 2.38 $\mu$m and $\pm$ 2.24 $\mu$m, respectively; and a greater than 360 nm 1-dB bandwidth. These results demonstrate the potential of our coupler as a universal interface in future co-packaged optics systems.</description>

      <title>Determination of Mid-Infrared Refractive Indices of Superconducting Thin Films Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of the thin films from FTIR measurements, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent the dielectric functions of the films and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit these oscillator parameters, minimizing the error between the measured FTIR spectra and the simulated spectra calculated using the dielectric functions of the films. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive index values extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. For further validation, we calculated the sheet resistance of the films from their extracted Drude oscillator parameters and compared with the experimental values. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks yielding devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables the use of physics-informed device topologies in inverse design and maintains compliance to foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Intelligent Optoelectronics in 2-D van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optoelectronics, achieving electrical reconfigurability is crucial as it enables the encoding, decoding, manipulating, and processing of information carried by light. In recent years, two-dimensional van der Waals (2-D vdW) materials have emerged as promising platforms for realizing reconfigurable optoelectronic devices. Compared to materials with bulk crystalline lattice, 2-D vdW materials offer superior electrical reconfigurability due to high surface-to-volume ratio, quantum confinement, reduced dielectric screening effect, and strong dipole resonances. Additionally, their unique band structures and associated topology and quantum geometry provide novel tuning capabilities. This review article seeks to establish a connection between the fundamental physics underlying reconfigurable optoelectronics in 2-D materials and their burgeoning applications in intelligent optoelectronics. We first survey various electrically reconfigurable properties of 2-D vdW materials and the underlying tuning mechanisms. Then we highlight the emerging applications of such devices, including dynamic intensity, phase and polarization control, and intelligent sensing. Finally, we discuss the opportunities for future advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Improving the Spatial Resolution of a BOTDA Sensor Using Physics-Enhanced Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high spatial resolution Brillouin Gain Spectrum (BGS) reconstruction method combining a neural network and a physical model is designed and proposed for Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) systems. This approach achieves sub-meter spatial resolution directly from a single long pulse experimental data through self-supervised learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a physical model has been used to enhance neural network models in the field of optical fiber sensing. Simulation results show that the BGS distribution reconstructed by this technique has a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.02 compared to the ideal BGSs. And the standard deviation of the extracted BFS is 0.65 MHz. Experimental results indicate that, for a 40 ns pulse BGS distribution, the proposed approach accurately reconstructs a BGS distribution with 0.5 m spatial resolution. The proposed technique demonstrates a significant advantage over results from the deconvolution algorithm and supervised learning methods.</description>

      <title>Scalable photonic-phonoinc integrated circuitry for reconfigurable signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between photons and phonons plays a crucial role in broad areas ranging from optical sources and modulators to quantum transduction and metrology. The performance can be further improved using integrated photonic-phononic devices, promising enhanced interaction strength and large-scale integration. While the enhanced interaction has been widely demonstrated, it is challenging to realize large-scale integrated photonic-phononic circuits due to material limitations. Here, we resolve this critical issue by using gallium nitride on sapphire for scalable photonicphononic integrated circuits. Both optical and acoustic fields are confined in sub-wavelength scales without suspended structures. This enables us to achieve the efficient launching, flexible routing, and reconfigruable processing of optical and acoustic fields simultaneously. With the controlled photonic-phononic interaction and strong piezoelectric effect, we further demonstrate the reconfigurable conversion between frequency-multiplexed RF and optical signals mediated by acoustics. This work provides an ideal platform for achieving ultimate performance of photonic-phononic hybrid systems with high efficiency, multiple functions, and large scalability.</description>

      <title>On the breathing modes at the interfaces of two medium leading to radiation and guiding of spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the propagation and radiation of spin waves in gyroelectric waveguides within the terahertz (THz) frequency range. With applications in imaging, spectroscopy, and integrated circuits, THz radiation has garnered significant interest, but the two-way propagation of traditional plasmonic waveguides limits their potential in nonreciprocal devices like isolators and switches. We explore the use of magnetically biased semiconductors, particularly InSb, which exhibit gyroelectric behavior at THz frequencies, offering promising alternatives to ferrites that face limitations at higher frequencies. Through the analysis of the near field region of a dipole antenna and a loop antenna, we examine the coupling between magnons and photons and the formation of reactive modes with imaginary impedance. We demonstrate how gyrotropy breaks spin-momentum locking, leading to unidirectional propagation of waves, and investigate the emergence of breathing and hyperbolic modes, along with cut-off modes, in these media. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of THz waveguides and their potential for the development of advanced radiating and guiding structures.</description>

      <title>Exploiting hidden singularity on the surface of the Poincar\'e sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Pancharatnam-Berry phase, a variant of the geometric phase, arises purely from the modulation of the polarization state of a light beam. Due to its dependence on polarization changes, it cannot be effectively utilized for wavefront shaping in systems that require maintaining a constant (co-polarized) polarization state. Here, we present a novel topologically protected phase modulation mechanism capable of achieving anti-symmetric full 2{\pi} phase shifts with near-unity efficiency for two orthogonal co-polarized channels. Compatible with -- but distinct from- - the dynamic phase, this approach exploits phase circulation around a hidden singularity on the surface of the Poincar\'e sphere. We validate this concept in the microwave regime through the implementation of multi-layer metasurfaces. This new phase modulation mechanism expands the design toolbox of flat optics for light modulation beyond conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>MAPS: Multi-Fidelity AI-Augmented Photonic Simulation and Inverse Design Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design has emerged as a transformative approach for photonic device optimization, enabling the exploration of high-dimensional, non-intuitive design spaces to create ultra-compact devices and advance photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in computing and interconnects. However, practical challenges, such as suboptimal device performance, limited manufacturability, high sensitivity to variations, computational inefficiency, and lack of interpretability, have hindered its adoption in commercial hardware. Recent advancements in AI-assisted photonic simulation and design offer transformative potential, accelerating simulations and design generation by orders of magnitude over traditional numerical methods. Despite these breakthroughs, the lack of an open-source, standardized infrastructure and evaluation benchmark limits accessibility and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address this, we introduce MAPS, a multi-fidelity AI-augmented photonic simulation and inverse design infrastructure designed to bridge this gap. MAPS features three synergistic components: (1) MAPS-Data: A dataset acquisition framework for generating multi-fidelity, richly labeled devices, providing high-quality data for AI-for-optics research. (2) MAPS-Train: A flexible AI-for-photonics training framework offering a hierarchical data loading pipeline, customizable model construction, support for data- and physics-driven losses, and comprehensive evaluations. (3) MAPS-InvDes: An advanced adjoint inverse design toolkit that abstracts complex physics but exposes flexible optimization steps, integrates pre-trained AI models, and incorporates fabrication variation models. This infrastructure MAPS provides a unified, open-source platform for developing, benchmarking, and advancing AI-assisted photonic design workflows, accelerating innovation in photonic hardware optimization and scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tunable THz wave generation using spectral shaping in electro-optic combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for generating terahertz (THz) waves using cascaded electro-optic modulators (EOMs), providing numerical simulations and experimental validations to demonstrate its effectiveness. The key of this technique is to apply hybrid amplitude and phase modulation to the incident light, which significantly enhances the control capability over the output optical spectrum. This enhanced control turns to be crucial for the efficient generation of THz waves. By carefully adjusting the relative phase offset between microwave RF signals applied to the amplitude and phase modulators and by applying an appropriate DC bias to the amplitude modulator, we can considerably reduce the optical power of unwanted sidebands. This allows us to concentrate more energy on desired frequencies, facilitating the generation of high-purity THz waves through optical heterodyne mixing at the detector. To validate our concept, we have successfully generated a dual-frequency-like laser with as spectral separation of 0.897 THz. This result was accomplished by modulating the phase EOM at 34.5 GHz with a modulation depth of ~4.7, paving the way for the generation of more practical and efficient THz waves.</description>

      <title>Laser discrimination and detection at the sub-pW level using photon sensitive detection of self coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavelength independent detection and discrimination of laser radiation has been performed by detecting the 'self coherence' of an incoming light source with photon sensitive detectors. The system successfully discriminates between coherent and incoherent sources. Detection of scattered light has been performed across the visible spectrum with filters or internal or external source comparisons. The ultimate detection sensitivity was shown to be 0.38pW for a continuous wave HeNe laser at 632nm. We beleive this to be the most sensitive wavelength independent detection of a CW laser ever reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of synthetic dimensions has emerged as a powerful framework in photonics and atomic physics, enabling the exploration of high-dimensional physics beyond conventional spatial constraints. Originally developed for quantum simulations in high dimensions, synthetic dimensions have since demonstrated advantages in designing novel Hamiltonians and manipulating quantum or optical states for exploring topological physics, and for applications in computing and information processing. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of progress in synthetic dimensions across photonic, atomic, and other physical platforms over the past decade. We showcase different approaches used to construct synthetic dimensions and highlight key physical phenomena enabled by the advantage of such a framework. By offering a unified perspective on developments in this field, we aim to provide insights into how synthetic dimensions can bridge fundamental physics and applied technologies, fostering interdisciplinary engagement in quantum simulation, atomic and photonic engineering, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Integrated Photonic Topology Optimization with Nonvertical Sidewall Profiles: Applications in Lithium Niobate and Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enable density-based topology optimization (TO) to design integrated photonic devices featuring nonvertical sidewall profiles. Specifically, we demonstrate TO for fabrication processes with slanted sidewalls which are often used to enhance vertical coupling efficiency and fabrication processes with angled sidewalls which are a common feature of etching. The techniques demonstrated are readily adaptable to other etch profiles such as asymmetric or nonlinear. The enhancements are compatible with existing TO techniques, lengthscale constraints and multi-layer designs, and any dielectric materials, suiting the techniques for both academic and commercial foundry fabrications. We demonstrated the developed capabilities by designing slanted and angled silicon grating couplers and thin-film lithium niobate on insulator dual-polarization s-bends.</description>

      <title>Quantum illumination via frequency-mode-based correlation-to-displacement conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum illumination leverages entanglement to surpass classical target detection, even in high-noise environments. Remarkably, its quantum advantage persists despite entanglement degradation caused by environmental decoherence. A central challenge lies in designing optimal receivers to exploit this advantage, with the correlation-to-displacement conversion module emerging as a promising candidate. However, the practical implementation of the conversion module faces technical hurdles, primarily due to the vast number of modes involved. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a frequency-mode entangled source with matched photon numbers, a heterodyne detection scheme for the returned signals across vast modes, and a cavity-enhanced quantum pulse gate for programmable mode processing. This integrated framework paves the way for the realization of practical quantum illumination systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the light-sheet confocal quantum diamond microscope (LC-QDM) for widefield 3D quantum sensing with efficient confocal readout. The LC-QDM leverages light-sheet illumination and laser scanning confocal methods to enable high-resolution, high-speed 3D measurements with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond, combining the best of widefield and confocal modalities in a single device and eliminating the need for thin-NV-layer diamond chips. We perform simulations and measurements of NV initialization and readout times to model the anticipated performance of the LC-QDM compared to existing QDM designs. Our findings show that the LC-QDM will provide significant advantages for applications requiring limited laser power.</description>

      <title>Rapid morphology characterization of two-dimensional TMDs and lateral heterostructures based on deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures exhibit unique physical properties, necessitating efficient and accurate characterization methods. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a deep learning-based method for efficiently characterizing heterostructures and 2D materials, specifically MoS2-MoSe2 lateral heterostructures and MoS2 flakes with varying shapes and thicknesses. By utilizing YOLO models, we achieve an accuracy rate of over 94.67% in identifying these materials. Additionally, we explore the application of transfer learning across different materials, which further enhances model performance. This model exhibits robust generalization and anti-interference ability, ensuring reliable results in diverse scenarios. To facilitate practical use, we have developed an application that enables real-time analysis directly from optical microscope images, making the process significantly faster and more cost-effective than traditional methods. This deep learning-driven approach represents a promising tool for the rapid and accurate characterization of 2D materials, opening new avenues for research and development in material science.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Nonlocality in Photonic Materials and Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.</description>

      <title>Light-controlled strong coupling of optical cavity modes spaced by 200 THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $&gt;$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.</description>

      <title>Controlling emitter-field coupling in waveguides with a nanomechanical phase shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control light-matter interfaces with solid-state photon emitters is a major requirement for the development of quantum photonic integrated circuits. We demonstrate controllable coupling between a quantum dot and an optical mode in a dielectric waveguide using a nano-opto-electro-mechanical phase shifter and a photonic crystal mirror. By controlling the phase, we induce a virtual displacement of the mirror that modifies the local density of states at the position of the emitter, thereby enhancing or suppressing spontaneous emission without an optical cavity. We observe a broadband tuning of the spontaneous emission rate and a modulation of the intensity emitted by the quantum dot in the waveguide. The method reported here could be employed to optimize the emitter-field interaction between quantum dots in-operando, by maximizing a single-photon source generation rate or adjusting its lifetime, as well as a characterization tool for the direct measurement of emitter-photon cooperativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous scientific phenomenon in various physical systems. Here, we examine the feasibility of generating multistable and dynamically tunable synchronization by using the technique of Floquet engineering. Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us not only to explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic topology wherein the phase trajectories have a nontrivial winding number and giant non-reciprocity. This scheme could help to elucidate the dynamics of complicated oscillator networks like biological systems and to mimic their highly efficient information processing.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced emissions from diamond color centers in slow light photonic crystal waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories based on emitters with optically addressable spins rely on efficient photonic interfaces, often implemented as nanophotonic cavities with ideally narrow spectral linewidths and small mode volumes. However, these approaches require nearly perfect spectral and spatial overlap between the cavity mode and quantum emitter, which can be challenging. This is especially true in the case of solid-state quantum emitters that are often randomly positioned and can suffer from significant inhomogeneous broadening. An alternative approach to mitigate these challenges is to use slow-light waveguides that can enhance light-matter interaction across large optical bandwidths and large areas. Here, we demonstrate diamond slow light photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides that enable broadband optical coupling to embedded silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers. We take advantage of the recently demonstrated thin-film diamond photonic platform to fabricate fully suspended two-dimensional PhC waveguides. Using this approach, we demonstrate waveguide modes with high group indices up to 70 and observe Purcell-enhanced emissions of the SiVs coupled to the waveguide mode. Our approach represents a practical diamond platform for robust spin-photon interfaces with color centers.</description>

      <title>Characterization of electron density and ionization of a uranium laser produced plasma using laser absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution tunable laser spectroscopy is used to measure time-resolved absorption spectra for ten neutral uranium transitions and six singly-ionized transitions in a laser produced plasma. Spectral lineshapes are analyzed to determine temporal variations in ion and neutral total column densities, excitation temperatures, kinetic temperatures, and collisional broadening effects as the plasma cools. Comparison of ion to neutral column densities shows a ratio greater than 10 at times $&lt;$ 15 $\mu$s after plasma onset, with the ratio not reaching unity until $\sim$50 $\mu$s. Spectral lineshapes are analyzed to separate Stark and van der Waals contributions to collisional broadening, from which electron densities are determined and found to decrease from $\sim$10$^{15}$-10$^{13} $cm$^{-3}$ over times from 4-25 $\mu$s. Using absorption spectroscopy to determine charge properties and electron density over these time scales and at low magnitudes provides valuable insight into plasma properties not obtainable using conventional emission spectroscopy. Comparisons between ion and neutral densities, excitation temperatures, kinetic temperatures, and electron densities could indicate potential deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and Saha ionization predictions.</description>

      <title>One-Step Event-Driven High-Speed Autofocus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed autofocus in extreme scenes remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods rely on repeated sampling around the focus position, resulting in ``focus hunting''. Event-driven methods have advanced focusing speed and improved performance in low-light conditions; however, current approaches still require at least one lengthy round of ``focus hunting'', involving the collection of a complete focus stack. We introduce the Event Laplacian Product (ELP) focus detection function, which combines event data with grayscale Laplacian information, redefining focus search as a detection task. This innovation enables the first one-step event-driven autofocus, cutting focusing time by up to two-thirds and reducing focusing error by 24 times on the DAVIS346 dataset and 22 times on the EVK4 dataset. Additionally, we present an autofocus pipeline tailored for event-only cameras, achieving accurate results across a range of challenging motion and lighting conditions. All datasets and code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Surface Topography as an Energy State: Hamiltonian Description of Functional Properties in Phase Space and Quantification via Optical Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assessment of tribological processes necessitates comprehensive monitoring and interpretation of surface states, traditionally by topography height values and surface texture parameters. This paper proposes a phase space representation as generic interpretation of surfaces to enhance tribological assessments. By deriving distinctions between two-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds from phenomenological thermodynamics, we demonstrate the existence of fractal dimensions on physical surfaces. Utilizing the smallest representable wavelength, a coordinate ensemble where each coordinate has a generalized degree of freedom and a differential amount across fractal dimensions is proposed. The metric is interpreted as a time coordinate, allowing the derivative to be seen as velocity. Through geometric dimension analysis, we derive a topographic Hamiltonian via generalized momentum. Each coordinate pair in the ensemble is assigned a location in phase space. Statistical considerations define a symplectic structure and phase space volume. As a use-case, a two-disc experiment demonstrates that topography changes under load can be understood as a self-organization process through thermodynamic reasoning. As a possibility for a direct assessment of the phase space of a surface for monitoring tribological processes, we propose the combination of topographic measuring systems with scattering light measurement. This multi sensor approach offers opportunities for optimizing performance in tribological applications.</description>

Abstract: Developing phosphors with narrow photoluminescence emission peaks and high chromatic stability holds significant importance in light-emitting diode (LED) display technologies, where a wide color gamut is essential to achieve the Rec. 2020 specifications. This research focuses on the optical properties of a solid solution: $M^I_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$$M^{III}$P$_3$O$_9$N [$M^I$=Na, K; $M^{III}$=Al, (Al$_{0.75}$Ga$_{0.25}$), (Al$_{0.5}$Ga$_{0.5}$), (Al$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$), Ga, (Ga$_{0.75}$In$_{0.25}$), (Ga$_{0.5}$In$_{0.5}$)] to understand how the narrow-emitting photoluminescence in K$_3$AlP$_3$O$_9$N:Eu$^{2+}$ can evolve during host structure cation substitution. Photoluminescence measurements at low temperature (15 K) support that Eu$^{2+}$ replaces three crystallographically independent Na$^+$ sites in Na$_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$AlP$_3$O$_9$N, similar to the parent K$^+$ phosphor, but substituting Ga$^{3+}$ and In$^{3+}$ for Al$^{3+}$ leads to a change in Eu$^{2+}$ site preference, narrowing the full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) of the emission peak. The chromatic stability and photoluminescence quantum yield are also enhanced with higher Ga$^{3+}$ content in the host but not with In$^{3+}$. Thermoluminescence analysis indicates the relationship between trap states and the enhanced quantum yield with Ga$^{3+}$ leads to the series' best performance. The analysis of the $M^I_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$$M^{III}$P$_3$O$_9$N series offers insight into the potential method for modulating optical properties with cation substitution in the host structure.</description>

      <title>First direct observation of a wakefield generated with structured light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of structured light to control the phase velocity of the wake in laser-wakefield accelerators has generated significant interest for its ability to mitigate electron dephasing. Combining the diffraction-free properties of Bessel beams with spatio-temporal shaping of the pulse promises to enable acceleration with an unprecedented combination of long acceleration lengths and high gradients. This would facilitate the acceleration of electrons to energies above 100 GeV in existing laser facilities. In-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms involved is critical to achieving dephasing-free electron acceleration. Here we present the first experimental observation of wakefields generated by beams that were spatio-temporally sculpted and then focused with a long-focal-depth mirror, known as an axiparabola, which generates a quasi-Bessel beam. The resulting wakefield was imaged using femtosecond relativistic electron microscopy. Novel insights into this minimally explored regime include mapping the wakefield development over the focal depth and studying the effects of spatio-temporal manipulations of the beam on the structure and phase velocity of the wakefield. Such insights pave the way towards realizing the potential of structured-light based solutions to dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) on two-dimensional materials allows simultaneous recording of the real-space image (tens of nanometers in size) and diffraction pattern of the same sample in one single-shot intensity measurement. In this study, we employ time-series CBED to visualize single Au nanoparticles deposited on graphene. The real-space image of the probed region, with the amount, size, and positions of single Au nanoparticles, is directly observed in the zero-order CBED disk, while the atomic arrangement of the Au nanoparticles is available from the intensity distributions in the higher-order CBED disks. From the time-series CBED patterns, the movement of a single Au nanoparticle with rotation up to 4{\deg} was recorded. We also observed facet diffraction lines - intense bright lines formed between the CBED disks of the Au nanoparticle, which we explain by diffraction at the Au nanoparticle's facets. This work showcases CBED as a useful technique for studying adsorbates on graphene using Au nanoparticles as a model platform, and paves the way for future studies of different objects deposited on graphene.</description>

Abstract: New techniques for the optical generation of plasma waveguides -- optical fibres for ultra-intense light pulses -- have become vital to the advancement of multi-GeV laser wakefield acceleration. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and characterization of a transmissive eight-level logarithmic diffractive axicon (LDA) for the generation of meter-scale plasma waveguides. These LDAs enable the formation of a Bessel-like beam with controllable start and end locations of the focal line and near-constant intensity on axis. We present measurements of the Bessel-like focal profile produced by the LDA, and of the leading end of the plasma column generated by it. One important feature is the formation of a funnel-mouthed plasma channel entrance that can act as waveguide coupler. We also compare the diffraction efficiency of our 8-level LDA to 4-level and binary versions, with measurements comparing well to theory.</description>

      <title>Lateral Contrast Enhancement in Tomographic Volumetric 3D-Printing via Binary Photoinhibition</title>

Abstract: Tomographic volumetric 3D-printing (TVP) utilizes a nonlinear photoresponse of polymer precursor to cure all points in a three-dimensional (3D) object in parallel. A key challenge in TVP is to build up dose contrast between in-part and out-of-part points in a lateral plane, which relies on coordinated illumination from various projecting angles. This challenge has mainly been tackled by projection optimization. Here we show that designing material responses to photo-excitation can be a more effective way of addressing this challenge. By introducing a secondary photo-inhibitory species that reacts to external ultraviolet (UV) stimulus, we create a binary photoinhibition (BPI) system that greatly enhances the achievable dose contrast in a lateral plane. We first show that, in theory, combining dose subtraction with sufficient projection angles can guarantee an exact mathematical reconstruction of any greyscale design. We then propose a theoretical framework for BPI, in which a single stationary state with swappable stability can be used to realize dose subtraction. We use oxygen-lophyl radical pair as an approximation to show improvements in print quality enabled by enhanced dose contrast. In situ shadowgraphy shows that BPI improves the lateral patterning with various geometric features, creating differentiable changes in refractive index within 54 um or less. We show qualitative improvements in surface features and internal hollowness in physical prints. The direct impacts of UV light on the formation of positive and negative features on vertical and lateral planes of 5 workpieces are analyzed quantitatively. We conclude that introducing BPI with UV irradiation grants us direct control over the formation of negative features on the lateral plane.</description>

      <title>Cartesian and spherical multipole expansions in anisotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12303</link>

Abstract: The multipole expansion can be formulated in spherical and Cartesian coordinates. By constructing an explicit map linking both formulations in isotropic media, we discover a lack of equivalence between them in anisotropic media. In isotropic media, the Cartesian multipole tensor can be reduced to a spherical tensor containing fewer independent components. In anisotropic media, however, the loss of propagation symmetry prevents this reduction. Consequently, non-harmonic sources radiate fields that can be projected onto a finite set of Cartesian multipole moments but require potentially infinitely many spherical moments. For harmonic sources, the link between the two approaches provides a systematic way to construct the spherical multipole expansion from the Cartesian one. The lack of equivalence between both approaches results in physically significant effects wherever the field propagation includes the Laplace operator. We demonstrate this issue in an electromagnetic radiation inverse problem in anisotropic media, including an analysis of a large-anisotropy regime and an introduction to vector spherical harmonics. We show that the use of the Cartesian approach increases the efficiency and interpretability of the model. The proposed approach opens the door to a broader application of the multipole expansion in anisotropic media.</description>

      <title>Inorganic electrochromic metasurface in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colour printing based on metallic or dielectric nanostructures has revolutionized colour science due to its unprecedented subwavelength resolution. Evidently, the evolution towards the active control of such structural colours with smart materials is in progress for real applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate a large colour gamut with high intensity and purity, as well as its switching on and off based solely on tungsten trioxide (WO3) cylindrical resonators. The strong resonances in the visible spectral range in these WO3 metasurfaces can be reversibly switched on and off due to its electrochromism by applying alternating voltages of +2.0 V and -0.3 V. Our approach opens up possibilities for the functional diversification of commercial smart windows, as well as the development of new display technologies in the future.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial "zones" with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our "zoned discrete axisymmetry" (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</description>

      <title>In Situ Optimization of an Optoelectronic Reservoir Computer with Digital Delayed Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.</description>
