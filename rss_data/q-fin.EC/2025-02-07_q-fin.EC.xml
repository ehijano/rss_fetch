      <title>Construal Level and Cognitive Reflection in Newsvendor Games: Unveiling the Influence of Individual Heterogeneity on Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last decade, scholars have studied the behavior of decision-making in newsvendor settings and have identified numerous behavior patterns for deviating from normative behavior. However, there is a dearth of research which have examined the influence of individual heterogeneity on decision-making in newsvendor settings. This study examines the level of construal (Abstract and concrete) using construal level theory (CLT) on performance in newsvendor games. In addition, this study measures the cognitive reflection of individuals using cognitive reflection test (CRT) ex-ante to analyze the true impact of how people construe a problem and its impact on their decision-making.</description>

      <title>The long-term impact of (un)conditional cash transfers on labour market outcomes in Ecuador</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries, evidence on their long-term effects remains scarce. This study assesses the impact of Ecuador's Human Development Grant on the formal sector labor market outcomes of children in eligible households. This grant, one of the first of its kind, is characterized by weak enforcement of its eligibility criteria. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the programme had no impact on formal employment rates and labour income earned in the formal sector around a decade after exposure, and thus not affecting the intergenerational transmission of poverty. We discuss possible explanations for the lack of significant results considering how the programme contributes to persistence in school in the medium term.</description>

      <title>The heterogeneous impact of the EU-Canada agreement with causal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a causal machine learning approach to investigate the impact of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). We propose a matrix completion algorithm on French customs data to obtain multidimensional counterfactuals at the firm, product and destination levels. We find a small but significant positive impact on average at the product-level intensive margin. On the other hand, the extensive margin shows product churning due to the treaty beyond regular entry-exit dynamics: one product in eight that was not previously exported substitutes almost as many that are no longer exported. When we delve into the heterogeneity, we find that the effects of the treaty are higher for products at a comparative advantage. Focusing on multiproduct firms, we find that they adjust their portfolio in Canada by reallocating towards their first and most exported product due to increasing local market competition after trade liberalization. Finally, multidimensional counterfactuals allow us to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of the CETA. Specifically, we observe trade diversion, as exports to other destinations are re-directed to Canada.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Strategic Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in structured tasks (e.g., coding and mathematics), it remains unexplored whether these abilities extend to strategic multi-agent environments. We investigate strategic reasoning capabilities -- the process of choosing an optimal course of action by predicting and adapting to others' actions -- of LLMs by analyzing their performance in three classical games from behavioral economics. We evaluate three standard LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Claude-2.1, Gemini 1.5) and three specialized reasoning LLMs (GPT-o1, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini Flash Thinking 2.0) using hierarchical models of bounded rationality. Our results show that reasoning LLMs exhibit superior strategic reasoning compared to standard LLMs (which do not demonstrate substantial capabilities), and often match or exceed human performance. Since strategic reasoning is fundamental to future AI systems (including Agentic AI and Artificial General Intelligence), our findings demonstrate the importance of dedicated reasoning capabilities in achieving effective strategic reasoning.</description>
