      <title>A Blockchain-based Reliable Federated Meta-learning for Metaverse: A Dual Game Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metaverse, envisioned as the next digital frontier for avatar-based virtual interaction, involves high-performance models. In this dynamic environment, users' tasks frequently shift, requiring fast model personalization despite limited data. This evolution consumes extensive resources and requires vast data volumes. To address this, meta-learning emerges as an invaluable tool for metaverse users, with federated meta-learning (FML), offering even more tailored solutions owing to its adaptive capabilities. However, the metaverse is characterized by users heterogeneity with diverse data structures, varied tasks, and uneven sample sizes, potentially undermining global training outcomes due to statistical difference. Given this, an urgent need arises for smart coalition formation that accounts for these disparities. This paper introduces a dual game-theoretic framework for metaverse services involving meta-learners as workers to manage FML. A blockchain-based cooperative coalition formation game is crafted, grounded on a reputation metric, user similarity, and incentives. We also introduce a novel reputation system based on users' historical contributions and potential contributions to present tasks, leveraging correlations between past and new tasks. Finally, a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism is presented to attract reliable workers to participate in meta-learning, minimizing users' energy costs, increasing payoffs, boosting FML efficacy, and improving metaverse utility. Results show that our dual game framework outperforms best-effort, random, and non-uniform clustering schemes - improving training performance by up to 10%, cutting completion times by as much as 30%, enhancing metaverse utility by more than 25%, and offering up to 5% boost in training efficiency over non-blockchain systems, effectively countering misbehaving users.</description>

      <title>PeerSwap: A Peer-Sampler with Randomness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of a peer-to-peer (P2P) system to effectively host decentralized applications often relies on the availability of a peer-sampling service, which provides each participant with a random sample of other peers. Despite the practical effectiveness of existing peer samplers, their ability to produce random samples within a reasonable time frame remains poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint. This paper contributes to bridging this gap by introducing PeerSwap, a peer-sampling protocol with provable randomness guarantees. We establish execution time bounds for PeerSwap, demonstrating its ability to scale effectively with the network size. We prove that PeerSwap maintains the fixed structure of the communication graph while allowing sequential peer position swaps within this graph. We do so by showing that PeerSwap is a specific instance of an interchange process, a renowned model for particle movement analysis. Leveraging this mapping, we derive execution time bounds, expressed as a function of the network size N. Depending on the network structure, this time can be as low as a polylogarithmic function of N, highlighting the efficiency of PeerSwap. We implement PeerSwap and conduct numerical evaluations using regular graphs with varying connectivity and containing up to 32768 (2^15) peers. Our evaluation demonstrates that PeerSwap quickly provides peers with uniform random samples of other peers.</description>

      <title>Toward Smart Scheduling in Tapis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tapis framework provides APIs for automating job execution on remote resources, including HPC clusters and servers running in the cloud. Tapis can simplify the interaction with remote cyberinfrastructure (CI), but the current services require users to specify the exact configuration of a job to run, including the system, queue, node count, and maximum run time, among other attributes. Moreover, the remote resources must be defined and configured in Tapis before a job can be submitted. In this paper, we present our efforts to develop an intelligent job scheduling capability in Tapis, where various attributes about a job configuration can be automatically determined for the user, and computational resources can be dynamically provisioned by Tapis for specific jobs. We develop an overall architecture for such a feature, which suggests a set of core challenges to be solved. Then, we focus on one such specific challenge: predicting queue times for a job on different HPC systems and queues, and we present two sets of results based on machine learning methods. Our first set of results cast the problem as a regression, which can be used to select the best system from a list of existing options. Our second set of results frames the problem as a classification, allowing us to compare the use of an existing system with a dynamically provisioned resource.</description>

      <title>Optimus: Accelerating Large-Scale Multi-Modal LLM Training by Bubble Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended the success of large language models (LLMs) to multiple data types, such as image, text and audio, achieving significant performance in various domains, including multimodal translation, visual question answering and content generation. Nonetheless, existing systems are inefficient to train MLLMs due to substantial GPU bubbles caused by the heterogeneous modality models and complex data dependencies in 3D parallelism. This paper proposes Optimus, a distributed MLLM training system that reduces end-to-end MLLM training time. Optimus is based on our principled analysis that scheduling the encoder computation within the LLM bubbles can reduce bubbles in MLLM training. To make scheduling encoder computation possible for all GPUs, Optimus searches the separate parallel plans for encoder and LLM, and adopts a bubble scheduling algorithm to enable exploiting LLM bubbles without breaking the original data dependencies in the MLLM model architecture. We further decompose encoder layer computation into a series of kernels, and analyze the common bubble pattern of 3D parallelism to carefully optimize the sub-millisecond bubble scheduling, minimizing the overall training time. Our experiments in a production cluster show that Optimus accelerates MLLM training by 20.5%-21.3% with ViT-22B and GPT-175B model over 3072 GPUs compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>The State of FaaS: An analysis of public Functions-as-a-Service providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serverless computing is a growing and maturing field that is the focus of much research, industry interest and adoption. Previous works exploring Functions-as-a-Service providers have focused primarily on the most well known providers AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions and Microsoft Azure Functions without exploring other providers in similar detail. In this work, we conduct the first detailed review of ten currently publicly available FaaS platforms exploring everything from their history, to their features and pricing to where they sit within the overall public FaaS landscape, before making a number of observations as to the state of the FaaS.</description>

      <title>PraFFL: A Preference-Aware Scheme in Fair Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in federated learning has emerged as a critical concern, aiming to develop an unbiased model for any special group (e.g., male or female) of sensitive features. However, there is a trade-off between model performance and fairness, i.e., improving model fairness will decrease model performance. Existing approaches have characterized such a trade-off by introducing hyperparameters to quantify client's preferences for model fairness and model performance. Nevertheless, these approaches are limited to scenarios where each client has only a single pre-defined preference, and fail to work in practical systems where each client generally have multiple preferences. The key challenge is to design a method that allows the model to adapt to diverse preferences of each client in real time. To this end, we propose a Preference-aware scheme in Fair Federated Learning paradigm (called PraFFL) to generate preference-wise model in real time. PraFFL can adaptively adjust the model based on each client's preferences to meet their needs. We theoretically prove that PraFFL can offer the optimal model tailored to an arbitrary preference of each client, and show its linear convergence. Experimental results show that our proposed PraFFL outperforms five fair federated learning algorithms in terms of the model's capability of adapting to clients' different preferences.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>
