      <title>Topology Optimization of Pneumatic Soft Actuators Based on Porohyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new nonlinear topology optimization framework which employs porohyperelasticity for providing computational design of pneumatic soft actuators. Density-based topology optimization is used with the objective of maximizing the bending response in a soft actuator made of an elastomer, for given actuation pressure and external resistance. Pressurization of interconnected cavities is modeled via an extension of the Darcy flow theory that is valid for large deformations. Essential for the good performance of the framework is a carefully chosen interpolation scheme for the permeability between void and solid regions, as well as a suitable definition of a drainage term in the solid regions. Results are shown for a variety of actuation pressure and maximum allowable strain energy density levels, covering a wide range of system responses from small to rather large deformations.</description>

      <title>Achieve equilibrium outside the contact angle hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common belief that the equilibrium contact angle, corresponding to the minimum system energy state, lies between advancing and receding contact angles. Here, we derive advancing and receding contact angles considering the micro contacting processes on ideal rough 2D surfaces. Equilibrium contact angles obtained via energy minimization can be smaller than the receding contact angle and reach 0 degrees, at which hysteresis diminishes on the super-hydrophilic surface. Gibbs free energy analyses, numerical simulations and physical experiments all confirm these new findings.</description>

      <title>Twist, splay, and uniform domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently-discovered ferroelectric nematic ($\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$) liquid crystal presents a host of defect phenomena due to its unique polar nature and long-ranged electrostatic interactions. Like the solid state ferroelectrics, the depolarization field in the material favors a spontaneous spatial variation of the polarization $\mathbf{P}$, manifesting in myriad ways including a twist in the bulk and different arrangements of alternating polarization domains. Unlike the solid-state ferroelectrics with a bulk crystalline structure, the configuration of the $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ fluids is determined not only by the reduction of depolarization fields but also by the alignment of molecules at interfaces. In this work, we consider an $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ confined to a thin cell, pre-patterned with various types of apolar surface anchoring produced by photoalignment. For uniform planar alignment, we find that the sample forms a series of striped domains. For a cell pre-patterned with a radial +1 defect pattern, the $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ breaks up into "pie-slice" polarization domains. We calculate the elastic and electrostatic energy balance which determines the observed configurations and demonstrate that the electrostatic interactions tend to decrease the characteristic domain size $\lambda$ while the elastic and surface anchoring interactions facilitate a larger $\lambda$. We also demonstrate that ionic screening mitigates electrostatic interactions, increasing $\lambda$ and, above some critical concentration, eliminating the domains altogether.</description>

      <title>Unifying shear thinning behaviors of meso-scaled particle suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheology of suspensions with meso-scaled particles [with size of $O(10^2)\ \text{nm}$ to $O(10)\ \mu\text{m}$] is intriguing since significant non-Newtonian behaviors are widely observed although the thermal fluctuation (Brownain motion) of the meso-scaled particles is negligible. Here, we show that the linear constitutive relation for such systems fails due to a flow-induced particle aggregation, which originates from the inherent inter-particle interactions, e.g., the weakly adhesive van der Waals interaction. This accounts for the temporal evolution of the rheological property in both steady and oscillatory shear flows. A dimensionless number that measures the importance of the hydrodynamic interaction in shear flow with respect to the inter-particle interaction, {is} proposed, through which the non-linear constitutive relation for suspensions with various particle sizes, particle concentrations, as well as flow conditions could be unified. This investigation bridge \mdf{the gap between micro- and macro-scaled suspension systems} and make the rheology of the meso-scaled suspensions predictable.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the hard-sphere potential model in three and four dimensions using a pseudo-hard-sphere potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hard-sphere potential has become a cornerstone in the study of both molecular and complex fluids. Despite its mathematical simplicity, its implementation in fixed time-step molecular simulations remains a formidable challenge due to the discontinuity at contact. To circumvent the issues associated with the ill-defined force at contact, a continuous potential--referred to here as the pseudo-hard-sphere (pHS) potential--has recently been proposed [J. Chem, Phys. 149, 164907 (2018)]. This potential is constructed to match the second virial coefficient of the hard-sphere potential and is expected to mimic its thermodynamic properties. However, this hypothesis has only been partially validated within the fluid region of the phase diagram for hard-sphere dispersions in two and three dimensions. In this contribution, we examine the ability of the continuous pHS potential to reproduce the equation of state of a hard-sphere fluid, not only in the fluid phase but also across the fluid-solid coexistence region. Our focus is primarily on hard-sphere systems in three and four dimensions. We compare the results obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of the pHS potential with those derived from refined event-driven simulations of the corresponding hard-sphere potential. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis with theoretical equations of state based on both mean-field and integral equation approximations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Ionic Liquid Affinity and Its Effect on Phospholipid Membrane Structure and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the impact of imidazolium based ILs on the viscoelasticity, dynamics, and phase behavior of two model membrane systems, (i) lipid monolayers and (ii) unilamellar vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Our findings demonstrate that both ILs induce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid molecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer alkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced disorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL incorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures and introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This effect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations. Quasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the lateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of enhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and alkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion occurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain IL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings, showing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce more gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance lateral diffusion. This increase in lipid fluidity and permeability provides a mechanistic basis for the observed higher toxicity associated with longer chain ILs.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous helix formation in polar smectic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soft ferroelectric crystals, the depolarization field can be reduced by periodic distortion of the polarization direction. In the polar nematic and tilted smectic phases, this process is energetically favorured , as it only requires changes in the director orientation. We demonstrate the spontaneous formation of a helical structure in the proper ferroelectric tilted smectic (SmCTBF) phase, the phase is formed below the heliconical polar nematic (NTBF) phase. The helical pitch in the smectic phase is approximately 600 nm and remains nearly constant across the entire temperature range of the phase. Under weak electric fields, the helix reorients while its structure remains largely intact; however, in stronger fields, the helix is destroyed as the electric polarization aligns along the electric field.</description>

      <title>Octagonal tilings with three prototiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by theoretically and experimentally observed structural phases with octagonal symmetry, we introduce a family of octagonal tilings which are composed of three prototiles. We define our tilings with respect to two non-negative integers, $m$ and $n$, so that the inflation factor of a given tiling is $\delta_{(m,n)}=m+n (1+\sqrt{2})$. As such, we show that our family consists of an infinite series of tilings which can be delineated into separate `cases' which are determined by the relationship between $m$ and $n$. Similarly, we present the primitive substitution rules or decomposition of our prototiles, along with the statistical properties of each case, demonstrating their dependence on these integers.</description>

      <title>Shape-asymmetry and flexibility in active cross-stream migration in nonuniform shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the interplay of activity and broken fore-aft symmetry of shapes helps microswimmers to migrate across streamlines in nonuniform shear, emphasizing a hitherto overlooked fundamental cause of active cross-stream migration in imposed flows. Using a framework on model flagellated microswimmers in a microchannel flow, we find that besides the broken head-tail shape symmetry, extended hydrodynamic coupling is vital for cross-stream migration, whereas flagellar flexibility significantly affects the same. Furthermore, by simplifying the problem to a basic analytical model, we are able to identify the fundamental factors affecting the observed rich nonlinear dynamics and predict the sorting and control of microswimmer populations inside a microchannel. Our predictions are general and apply to both living and artificial microswimmers, whereas the hydrodynamic framework developed here is necessary to probe other scenarios, such as in dense suspensions, where non-uniform shear and near-field flows become important.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Approach to Structural Relaxation and Diffusion in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are promising materials with unique mechanical and thermal properties, but their atomic-scale dynamics remain challenging to understand. In this work, we develop a unified approach to investigate the glass transition and structural relaxation in CoCrNi, Zr46Cu46Al8, Zr50Cu40Al10, and Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 metallic glasses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to analyze the radial distribution function at different temperatures and accurately determine the glass transition temperature. We then combine this temperature with the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time, tau_alpha(T). By connecting $\tau_\alpha(T)$ to the diffusion constant, the ECNLE predictions of tau_alpha(T) can be compared with those calculated from MD simulations or estimated based on the diffusion constant. By combining atomistic simulation with force-level statistical mechanics, our multiscale approach offers deeper insights into relaxation dynamics and diffusion across various timescales. The relationship between the glass transition and the liquidus temperature is elucidated. This study enhances understanding of the glassy dynamics and properties in complex amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Free Growth under Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ever since the ground breaking work of Trepat et al. in 2009, we know that cell colonies growing on a substrate can be under tensile mechanical stress. The origin of tension has so far been attributed to cellular motility forces being oriented outward of the colony. Works in the field mainly revolve around how this orientation of the forces can be explained, ranging from velocity alignment, self-sorting due to self-propulsion, to kenotaxis. In this work, we demonstrate that tension in growing colonies can also be explained without cellular motility forces! Using a combination of well established tissue growth simulation technique and analytical modelling, we show how tension can arise as a consequence of simple mechanics of growing tissues. Combining these models with a minimalistic motility model shows how colonies can expand while under even larger tension. Furthermore, our results and analytical models provide novel analysis procedures to identify the underlying mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetics of biological motors such as kinesin or dynein is notably influenced by viscoelastic intracellular environment. The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Viscous liquid dynamics modeled as random walks within overlapping hyperspheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypersphere model is a simple one-parameter model of the potential energy landscape of viscous liquids, which is defined as a percolating system of same-radius hyperspheres randomly distributed in $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ in which $N$ is the number of particles. We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in 12 to 45 dimensions, i.e., above the percolation threshold, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the hyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find behavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density (corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the dynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement as a function of time is found to be similar to that of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well the frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different chemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{119}, 248001\,(2017)$].</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems with nonreciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the critical behavior of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a nonreciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its phase transitions by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spin types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects but stabilized in three dimensions where nonreciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in the nonreciprocal Ising model</title>

Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions in many-body systems lead to time-dependent states, commonly observed in biological, chemical, and ecological systems. The stability of these states in the thermodynamic limit and the critical behavior of the phase transition from static to time-dependent states are not yet fully understood. To address these questions, we study a minimalistic system endowed with nonreciprocal interactions: an Ising model with two spin species having opposing goals. The mean-field equation predicts three stable phases: disorder, static order, and a time-dependent swap phase. Large scale numerical simulations support the following: (i) in 2D, the swap phase is destabilized by defects; (ii) in 3D, the swap phase is stable, and has the properties of a time crystal; (iii) the transition from disorder to swap in 3D is characterized by the critical exponents of the 3D XY model, and corresponds to the breaking of a continuous symmetry, time translation invariance; (iv) when the two species have fully anti-symmetric couplings, the static-order phase is unstable in any finite dimension due to droplet growth; (v) in the general case of asymmetric couplings, static order can be restored by a droplet-capture mechanism preventing the droplets from growing indefinitely. We provide details on the full phase diagram which includes first- and second-order-like phase transitions and study how the system coarsens into swap and static-order states.</description>

      <title>Reactive Fluid Ferroelectrics: A Gateway to the Next Generation of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystalline Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein we report the first examples of reactive mesogenic materials (RMs) which exhibit fluid ferroelectric order based on the recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase. We term these materials NF RMs and they provide the first steps towards the next generation of ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymer networks. We report the chemical synthesis and characterisation of the liquid crystalline properties of these materials, demonstrating that they have the lowest longitudinal molecular dipole moments of any reported NF material of 7.39 D. We go on to demonstrate a potential use case of this new class of reactive material through the polymer stabilisation of a matrix which exhibits the NF phase, increasing the phase range of the ferroelectric phase from 75 {\deg}C to 120 {\deg}C. The NF RMs reported herein are an exciting step forward in ferroelectric liquid crystal research, demonstrating that reactive NF materials are achievable, allowing for the future development of liquid crystalline ferroelectric networks, elastomers and polymers.</description>
