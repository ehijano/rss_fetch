      <title>Are Haicheng and Tangshan Earthquakes Dragon-Kings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework to systematically test the dragon-king earthquake hypothesis. Our method combines objective spatial clustering, based on data-adaptive kernel density estimation, with a high-power sequential outlier detection technique. We apply this framework to seismicity surrounding the 1975 Haicheng mL 7.4 and 1976 Tangshan mL 7.9 earthquakes. For Haicheng, the mainshock shows a strong dragon-king signature in its pre-mainshock sequence, with p-values between 0.03 and 0.07 across a stable range of density thresholds used to define natural seismicity clusters. Post-mainshock and combined sequences yield slightly higher p-values (up to 0.09). In contrast, Tangshan's mainshock exhibits a weaker outlier signal before the event (p-values in the range 0.05-0.15) but a stronger dragon-king signature afterward, with p-values from 0.015 to 0.05. The evidence that the Haicheng and Tangshan mainshocks exhibit dragon-king characteristics supports the idea that some large and great earthquakes arise from a maturation process that may enhance predictability.</description>

      <title>2025 Santorini-Amorgos crisis triggered by a transition from volcanic to regular tectonic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid movement beneath volcanic regions can influence earthquake activity, but the processes linking seismic and volcanic systems are not fully understood. In early 2025, an unusual seismic sequence occurred close to Santorini, providing new insight into these interactions. Here we show that the sequence was likely initiated by the accumulation and migration of fluids beneath the volcanic complex. Seismic and ground deformation data reveal a progression from deep fluid buildup and microfracturing to the concentration of shallow earthquakes beneath Columbo volcano. This culminated in a four-day seismic episode that behaved like a single, slow-propagating rupture along a 16-kilometer fault, releasing energy equivalent to a magnitude 6.2 earthquake. The rupture was followed by a typical aftershock sequence. These observations suggest that fluid-driven processes can generate large earthquakes and redistribute stress in ways similar to tectonic mainshocks. This challenges conventional views on how seismic and volcanic hazards are connected and assessed.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Reconstruction of Ground Motion During Small Magnitude Earthquakes: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11752v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a pilot investigation into a novel method for reconstructing real-time ground motion during small magnitude earthquakes (M &lt; 4.5), removing the need for computationally expensive source characterization and simulation processes to assess ground shaking. Small magnitude earthquakes, which occur frequently and can be modeled as point sources, provide ideal conditions for evaluating real-time reconstruction methods. Utilizing sparse observation data, the method applies the Gappy Auto-Encoder (Gappy AE) algorithm for efficient field data reconstruction. This is the first study to apply the Gappy AE algorithm to earthquake ground motion reconstruction. Numerical experiments conducted with SW4 simulations demonstrate the method's accuracy and speed across varying seismic scenarios. The reconstruction performance is further validated using real seismic data from the Berkeley area in California, USA, demonstrating the potential for practical application of real-time earthquake data reconstruction using Gappy AE. As a pilot investigation, it lays the groundwork for future applications to larger and more complex seismic events.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of water volume in a porous reservoir using seismic data: Validation of a numerical model with a field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As global groundwater levels continue to decline rapidly, there is a growing need for advanced techniques to monitor and manage aquifers effectively. This study focuses on validating a numerical model using seismic data from a small-scale experimental setup designed to estimate water volume in a porous reservoir. Expanding on previous work with synthetic data, we analyze seismic data acquired from a controlled experimental site in Laukaa, Finland. By employing neural networks, we directly estimate water volume from seismic responses, bypassing the traditional need for separate determinations, for example, of reservoir water table level and porosity. The study models wave propagation through a coupled poroviscoelastic-viscoelastic medium using a three-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin method. The proposed methodology is validated against experimental data, aiming to improve precision in mapping current water volumes and contributing to the development of sustainable groundwater management practices.</description>
