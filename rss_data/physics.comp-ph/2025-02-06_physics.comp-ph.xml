      <title>Physically Interpretable Representation and Controlled Generation for Turbulence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays a pivotal role in fluid mechanics, enabling precise simulations of fluid behavior through partial differential equations (PDEs). However, traditional CFD methods are resource-intensive, particularly for high-fidelity simulations of complex flows, which are further complicated by high dimensionality, inherent stochasticity, and limited data availability. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a data-driven approach that leverages a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) to encode high-dimensional scientific data into low-dimensional, physically meaningful representations. The GMVAE learns a structured latent space where data can be categorized based on physical properties such as the Reynolds number while maintaining global physical consistency. To assess the interpretability of the learned representations, we introduce a novel metric based on graph spectral theory, quantifying the smoothness of physical quantities along the latent manifold. We validate our approach using 2D Navier-Stokes simulations of flow past a cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers. Our results demonstrate that the GMVAE provides improved clustering, meaningful latent structure, and robust generative capabilities compared to baseline dimensionality reduction methods. This framework offers a promising direction for data-driven turbulence modeling and broader applications in computational fluid dynamics and engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Physics-Informed Neural Operators: Enhancing Operator Learning from Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have shown great potential in surrogate modeling. However, training a well-performing neural operator typically requires a substantial amount of data, which can pose a major challenge in complex applications. In such scenarios, detailed physical knowledge can be unavailable or difficult to obtain, and collecting extensive data is often prohibitively expensive. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Pseudo Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PPI-NO) framework. PPI-NO constructs a surrogate physics system for the target system using partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from simple, rudimentary physics principles, such as basic differential operators. This surrogate system is coupled with a neural operator model, using an alternating update and learning process to iteratively enhance the model's predictive power. While the physics derived via PPI-NO may not mirror the ground-truth underlying physical laws -- hence the term ``pseudo physics'' -- this approach significantly improves the accuracy of standard operator learning models in data-scarce scenarios, which is evidenced by extensive evaluations across five benchmark tasks and a fatigue modeling application.</description>

      <title>Implementation of integral surface tension formulations in a volume of fluid framework and their applications to Marangoni flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate numerical modeling of surface tension has been a challenging aspect of multiphase flow simulations. The integral formulation for modeling surface tension forces is known to be consistent and conservative, and to be a natural choice for the simulation of flows driven by surface tension gradients along the interface. This formulation was introduced by Popinet and Zaleski (1999) for a front-tracking method and was later extended to level set methods by Al-Saud et al. (2018). In this work, we extend the integral formulation to a volume of fluid (VOF) method for capturing the interface. In fact, we propose three different schemes distinguished by the way we calculate the geometric properties of the interface, namely curvature, tangent vector and surface fraction from VOF representation. We propose a coupled level set volume of fluid (CLSVOF) method in which we use a signed distance function coupled with VOF, a height function (HF) method in which we use the height functions calculated from VOF, and a height function to distance (HF2D) method in which we use a sign-distance function calculated from height functions. For validation, these methods are rigorously tested for several problems with constant as well as varying surface tension. It is found that from an accuracy standpoint, CLSVOF has the least numerical oscillations followed by HF2D and then HF. However, from a computational speed point of view, HF method is the fastest followed by HF2D and then CLSVOF. Therefore, the HF2D method is a good compromise between speed and accuracy for obtaining faster and correct results.</description>

      <title>Nudged elastic band calculations of stacking and dislocation pathways in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond, the hardest natural crystal, has attracted significant attention for its plasticity, which is reported to be determined by its stacking faults. Studies mainly focused on one-dimensional linear pathways in stacking transitions, neglecting its transverse freedom on the main slip plane. However, in an actual stacking procedure, stacking faults can follow curve line along the slip plane rather than constrained to straight lines. In this study, using ab initio calculations, we mapped the {\gamma}-surface, defined as the landscape of generalized stacking fault energies, along the weakest direction of the {111} orientation in diamond. We then applied the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method to determine the minimum energy paths, finding significantly reduced stacking energy barriers compared to previous reports (for the glide-set, our energy barrier is only one-third of that for the traditional direct path). Our calculations reveal that the glide-set can round its high-energy peak, with a lower energy barrier within the entire stacking plane than the shuffle-set. By employing the NEB method, we have constructed the minimum energy path (MEP) for both the stacking and dislocation procedures. Our results provide new insights into the plasticity and stacking faults of diamond, advancing the understanding of superhard carbon material transition, especially the diamond under shear stress.</description>

      <title>Quantitative thermodynamic analyses of nucleation, evolution and stabilization of surface nanobubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface nanobubbles are complex micro- and nanoscale fluid systems. While thermodynamics is believed to dominate nanobubble dynamics, the precise mechanism by which nanobubble evolution is driven by thermodynamics remains unclear. It is essential to understand how nanobubble nucleation and growth, nanoscale contact line movement, and gas diffusion across the liquid-bubble interface are simultaneously driven by the change in free energy, leading to the ultimate thermodynamic equilibrium of surface nanobubble systems. In this paper, we first propose a quantitative theoretical model to elucidate the thermodynamic dominance behind the dynamics and stability of the fluid system with surface nanobubbles. The present model demonstrates that thermodynamic non-equilibrium drives the gas diffusion and the contact line motion of surface nanobubbles. Overcoming the nucleation energy barrier is crucial for bubble nucleation and growth. Surface nanobubbles evolve towards the reduction of the system's free energy and stabilize at the state with minimum free energy. The thermodynamic equilibrium is accompanied by the mechanical equilibrium at the contact line and the gas diffusion equilibrium at the liquid-bubble interface, and the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the nanobubble morphology observed in experiments. The study highlights the significant influence of gas properties and ambient conditions in promoting bubble nucleation and stability.</description>

      <title>A new method for structural diagnostics with muon tomography and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of the muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of the reconstruction of 1 cm--thick iron tubes inside 30 cm--deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results into a dramatic improvement of the image quality, as well as into a significant reduction of the data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Magnetic Field in an Arbitrary Domain via Data-driven Bayesian Methods and Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>

      <title>Electric-field Switching of Interlayer Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Heterobilayer via Spin-potential Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric-field switching of magnetic order is of significant physical interest and holds great potential for spintronic applications. However, it has rarely been reported in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets due to the inherently weak interaction between spin order and electric fields. Here we propose a general spin-potential mechanism that significantly enhances the magnetoelectric coupling. As a result, the relative stability of different interlayer magnetic orders in an asymmetric van der Waals heterobilayer can be reversed by external electric fields via spin-potential coupling. Based on this mechanism, we designed a series of 2D vdW all-magnetic heterobilayers, such as CrI3/MnSe2, in which a transition from interlayer ferromagnetic (iFM) to antiferromagnetic (iAFM) order is realized by a feasible electric field around 0.1 V/{\AA}. Our findings not only reveal a novel magnetoelectric coupling mechanism, but also present a practical strategy for achieving pure electric-field-driven magnetic order switching</description>

      <title>Deep Ritz-Finite Element methods: Neural Network Methods trained with Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Open-source shape optimization for isogeometric shells using FEniCS and OpenMDAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python framework for the shape optimization of complex shell structures using isogeometric analysis (IGA). IGA seamlessly integrates computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis models by employing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) as basis functions, enabling the natural implementation of the Kirchhoff--Love shell model due to their higher order of continuity. We leverage the recently developed FEniCS-based analysis framework, PENGoLINS, for the direct structural analysis of shell structures consisting of a collection of NURBS patches through a penalty-based formulation. This contribution introduces the open-source implementation of gradient-based shape optimization for isogeometric Kirchhoff--Love shells with a modular architecture. Complex shell structures with non-matching intersections are handled using a free-form deformation (FFD) approach and a moving intersections formulation. The symbolic differentiation and code generation capabilities in FEniCS are utilized to compute the analytical derivatives. By integrating FEniCS with OpenMDAO, we build modular components that facilitate gradient-based shape optimization of shell structures. The modular architecture in this work supports future extensions and integration with other disciplines and solvers, making it highly customizable and suitable for a wide range of applications. We validate the design-analysis-optimization workflow through several benchmark problems and demonstrate its application to aircraft wing design optimization. The framework is implemented in a Python library named GOLDFISH (Gradient-based Optimization and Large-scale Design Framework for Isogeometric SHells) and the source code will be maintained at https://github.com/hanzhao2020/GOLDFISH.</description>
