      <title>Koszul Resolutions over Free Incomplete Tambara Functors for Cyclic $p$-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In equivariant algebra, Mackey functors replace abelian groups and incomplete Tambara functors replace commutative rings. In this context, we prove that equivariant Hochschild homology can sometimes be computed using Mackey functor-valued Tor. To compute these Tor Mackey functors for odd primes $p$, we define cyclic-$p$-group-equivariant analogues of the Koszul resolution which resolve the Burnside Mackey functor (the analogue of the integers) as a module over free incomplete Tambara functors (the analogue of polynomial rings). We apply these Koszul resolutions to compute Mackey functor-valued Hochschild homology of free incomplete Tambara functors for cyclic groups of odd prime order and for the cyclic group of order 9.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of an Algorithm for Determining the Triviality of the Second Homotopy Groups of Arbitrary Compact Topological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the non-existence of a computational algorithm capable of determining whether the second homotopy group of any compact constructive topological space is trivial. This finding shows the inherent limitations of computer methods in resolving certain topological problems.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis in smart manufacturing: State of the art and futuredirections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a discipline that applies algebraic topology techniques to analyze complex, multi-dimensional data. Although it is a relatively new field, TDA has been widely and successfully applied across various domains, such as medicine, materials science, and biology. This survey provides an overview of the state of the art of TDA within a dynamic and promising application area: industrial manufacturing and production, particularly within the Industry 4.0 context. We have conducted a rigorous and reproducible literature search focusing on TDA applications in industrial production and manufacturing settings. The identified works are categorized based on their application areas within the manufacturing process and the types of input data. We highlight the principal advantages of TDA tools in this context, address the challenges encountered and the future potential of the field. Furthermore, we identify TDA methods that are currently underexploited in specific industrial areas and discuss how their application could be beneficial, with the aim of stimulating further research in this field. This work seeks to bridge the theoretical advancements in TDA with the practical needs of industrial production. Our goal is to serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers applying TDA in industrial production and manufacturing systems. We advocate for the untapped potential of TDA in this domain and encourage continued exploration and research.</description>
