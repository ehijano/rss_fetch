      <title>Causal Interpretations in Observational Studies: The Role of Sociocultural Backgrounds and Team Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of drawing causal conclusions from observational studies has raised concerns about potential exaggeration in science communication. While some believe causal language should only apply to randomized controlled trials, others argue that rigorous methods can justify causal claims in observational studies. Ideally, causal language should align with the strength of the evidence. However, through the analysis of over 80,000 observational study abstracts using computational linguistic and regression methods, we found that causal language is more frequently used by less experienced authors, smaller research teams, male last authors, and authors from countries with higher uncertainty avoidance indices. These findings suggest that the use of causal language may be influenced by external factors such as the sociocultural backgrounds of authors and the dynamics of research collaboration. This newly identified link deepens our understanding of how such factors help shape scientific conclusions in causal inference and science communication.</description>

      <title>Simulated Bifurcation with High-dimensional Expansion for Traffic Signal Optimization on Real-world Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With accelerating urbanization and worsening traffic congestion, optimizing traffic signal systems to improve road throughput and alleviate congestion has become a critical issue. This study proposes a short-term traffic prediction model based on real-world road topologies and a typical four-way, eight-phase traffic signal control scheme. The model accounts for traffic flow disparities across directions and signal phase change frequencies, integrating these factors into an optimization objective for global traffic optimization. The structure of this objective function is similar to spin-glass systems in statistical physics. A Simulated Bifurcation optimization algorithm is introduced, with traditional simulated annealing as a benchmark. The results show that Simulated Bifurcation outperforms simulated annealing in both efficiency and effectiveness. Using real traffic flow and road network data from Beijing, we initialized the model and conducted numerical optimization experiments. The results indicate that Simulated Bifurcation significantly outperforms simulated annealing in computational efficiency, effectively solving combinatorial optimization problems with multiple spin interactions, and reducing the time complexity to $O(N^{1.35})$. This solution addresses the NP-hard problem of global traffic signal optimization. Importantly, the signal phase patterns generated by Simulated Bifurcation align with the operational requirements of real traffic signal systems, showcasing its potential in optimizing signal control for large, complex urban traffic networks. This work provides solid theoretical and practical foundations for future urban traffic management and intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>IPSR Model: Misinformation Intervention through Prebunking in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present digital world, the rapid spread of misinformation is not just an annoyance but a real threat to public safety, and our collective decision-making. Prebunking, a type of psychological immunization, can educate people about misinformation and lay a foundation of cognitive resilience that makes them more robust against future misinformation. We use a compartmental modeling approach inspired by vaccination models from epidemiology to model the effectiveness of prebunking misinformation. Populations are classified into different compartments based on the exposure to prebunking and the propagation of misinformation through online social networks. Specific rates dictate the transitions between such states, similar to how people traverse between susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments in classical epidemiological models. This model integrates different levels of prebunking potency, the fraction of the population prebunked initially, and the forgetting rate effects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work which study the extent of prebunking interventions to reduce the scale of misinformation, much as vaccinations curtail the spread of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Quantitative, Data-driven Network Model for Global Cascading Financial Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global catastrophic risk events, such as nuclear war, pose a severe threat to the stability of international financial systems. As evidenced by even less severe scenarios like the Great Recession, an economic failure can propagate through the world trade network, wreaking havoc on the global economy. While the contemporary literature on cascading failure models addresses this issue qualitatively, a simple and intuitive quantitative estimation that could be used in integrated assessment frameworks is missing. In this study, we introduce a quantitative network model of global financial cascading failure. Our proposal is a fast, efficient, single free parameter model, following a straightforward logic of propagating failures. We fit the model to the Great Recession and test it against historical examples and commercial analysis. We also provide predictions for a hypothetical armed conflict between India and Pakistan. Our aim is to introduce a quantitative approach that could inform policy decisions by contextualising global catastrophic scenarios regarding financial losses and assessing the effectiveness of resilience strategies, complementing existing models and frameworks for broader risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Free Energy and Network Structure: Breaking Scale-Free Behaviour Through Information Processing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how The Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing. We propose a minimal FEP model for node behaviour reveals three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment. In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale. Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent's information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining them as signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints. We show that agents evolving under FEP principles provides a mechanism for preferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-world networks.</description>

Abstract: In Social Network Analysis (SNA), k-core decomposition is used to detect hierarchical shells in networks. The application of the K-core decomposition to a network of keywords allows us to represent the conceptual structure of a research field. The objective of this work was to propose the application of k-core decomposition to show the evolution of the conceptual structure of the Altmetrics research field. The methodology was developed in several phases: data collection, keyword selection, elaboration of a keyword co-occurrence matrix, generation of a keyword network, k-core decomposition and visualization of the hierarchical structure. The result was the detection of five differentiated shells. A core shell with basic, densely interconnected concepts that formed the knowledge base of the field. An intermediate shell with mediating concepts that showed the evolution of knowledge in the field. A lateral shell with concepts that indicated the specialization of the research field. A border shell with peripheral and isolated concepts, which represented the conceptual fronts in development. In conclusion, the hierarchical decomposition of the keyword network achieved a deeper understanding of the conceptual structure of the research field</description>

      <title>Scaling of Street Network Centrality with City Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban scaling laws reveal how cities evolve as their populations grow, yet the role of street network accessibility in this process remains underexplored. We analyze over 5,000 Brazilian cities to establish a scaling law linking average closeness centrality $\langle c_C\rangle$ -- a measure of structural accessibility in street networks-to population size N . Our results demonstrate that $\langle c_C\rangle$ decays sublinearly as $N^{-\sigma}$ ($\sigma \approx 0.38$), indicating that larger cities redistribute accessibility from cores to peripheries while maintaining navigability through hierarchical shortcuts. This scaling arises from the fractal interplay between infrastructure and population, characterized by a network dimension $d \approx 2.17$, which exceeds that of a 2D grid. The slower decline in closeness centrality ($\sigma &lt; 0.5$) reflects a trade-off: urban expansion reduces proximity but enhances connectivity through optimized path diversity, fostering economic dynamism. By integrating the Molinero &amp; Thurner model with network centrality metrics, we provide a framework to reconcile infrastructure efficiency with equitable accessibility in growing cities.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Hypergraph Mining: Patterns, Tools, and Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs, which belong to the family of higher-order networks, are a natural and powerful choice for modeling group interactions in the real world. For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for each and offer in-depth discussions for future research on hypergraph mining.</description>

      <title>LGDE: Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on two user-generated English-language corpora and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with improved performance relative to methods based on direct word similarities or co-occurrences. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.</description>
