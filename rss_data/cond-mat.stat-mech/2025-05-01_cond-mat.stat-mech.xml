      <title>Discrete time crystals detected by time-translation twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a boundary condition twisted by time translation as a novel probe to characterize dynamical phases in periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems. Inspired by twisted boundary conditions in equilibrium systems, this approach modifies the temporal evolution of the system upon completing a spatial loop, enabling the identification of distinct Floquet phases, including discrete time crystals (DTCs). By studying the spectral form factor (SFF) and its response to the twist, we uncover signatures of time-crystalline order, which exhibits periodic dependence on the twist parameter analogous to the Little-Parks effect in superconductors. We apply this framework to the kicked Ising model, demonstrating that our twist can distinguish time-crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and trimers on attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer formation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for understanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization and optimization of heat engines: Pareto-optimal fronts and universal features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing and optimizing nanoscopic heat engines require an appropriate understanding of the interplay between power, efficiency, entropy production and fluctuations. Despite significant recent advancements, including linear stochastic thermodynamics and thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), a complete scenario remains elusive. In this work, we give a further step by showing that, under certain common and general conditions, the heat engine regime can be characterized by the minima of power fluctuations and entropy production, which together delimit its optimal performance, achieved when these conditions are fully satisfied. Conversely, when these conditions are not strictly met, the occurrence of the minimum still approximately describes the system, suggesting a broader range of applicability. Contrasting with most of studies in which the system optimization is carried out solely taking into account the power and efficiency, we introduce a multi-objective optimization framework based on Pareto fronts, also considering the role of fluctuation and dissipation. Our results reveal a general trend: while simultaneous optimization over a few parameters typically yields convex Pareto fronts, these fronts become concave as more parameters are varied freely and non-conservative driving becomes significant. Illustrating our findings, we consider simple two and three state systems as well as richer collective systems, exhibiting novel aspects of optimizations and protocol phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>Is Entanglement Necessary for the Typicality Argument in Statistical Mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typicality arguments replace the postulated mixed state ensembles of statistical mechanics with pure states sampled uniformly at random, explaining why most microstates of large systems exhibit thermal behavior. This paradigm has been revived in quantum contexts, where entanglement is deemed essential, but no clear quantitative link between entanglement structure and typicality has been established. Here, we study pure quantum states with controlled multipartite entanglement and show that when entanglement grows with system size $N$, fluctuations in macroscopic observables decay exponentially with $N$, whereas if entanglement remains finite, one recovers only the classical $1/\sqrt{N}$ suppression. Our work thus provides a quantitative connection between entanglement structure and the emergence of typicality, demonstrating that entanglement is crucial for thermalization in small quantum systems but unnecessary to justify equilibrium in macroscopic ensembles. This unifies classical and quantum foundations of statistical mechanics by pinpointing exactly when and why entanglement matters.</description>

      <title>Imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on a torus and on a pair of balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a general spectral approach based on the Steklov eigenbasis to describe imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on bounded reactive targets in three dimensions. The steady-state concentration and the total diffusive flux onto the target are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the exterior Steklov problem. In particular, the eigenvalues are shown to provide the geometric lengthscales of the target that are relevant for diffusion-controlled reactions. Using toroidal and bispherical coordinates, we propose an efficient procedure for analyzing and solving numerically this spectral problem for an arbitrary torus and a pair of balls, respectively. A simple two-term approximation for the diffusive flux is established and validated. Implications of these results in the context of chemical physics and beyond are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Algorithms for Estimating Ising Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating partition functions of Ising spin glasses is crucial in statistical physics, optimization, and machine learning, yet remains classically intractable due to its #P-hard complexity. While Jarzynski's equality offers a theoretical approach, it becomes unreliable at low temperatures due to rare divergent statistical fluctuations. Here, we present a protocol that overcomes this limitation by synergizing reverse quantum annealing with tailored nonequilibrium initial distributions. Our method can dramatically suppress the estimator variance, achieving saturation in the low-temperature regime. Numerical benchmarks on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass and the 3-SAT problem demonstrate that our protocol reduces scaling exponents by over an order of magnitude (e.g., from ~8.5 to ~0.5), despite retaining exponential system-size dependences. Crucially, our protocol circumvents stringent adiabatic constraints, making it feasible for near-term quantum devices like superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays. This work bridges quantum dynamics with computational complexity, offering a practical pathway to quantum advantage in spin glass thermodynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Topology, Kinetics and Inheritance in Clonal Colonies of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), whose populations contain multipotent skeletal stem cells with relevant therapeutic applications, are known to produce very heterogeneous colonies upon in vitro culture, a trait that may severely hinder the clinical usefulness of BMSC-based therapies. Therefore, reaching a better insight on the nature of such heterogeneity, as well as on the factors determining it, is important. Here, by using time-lapse microscopy, we study the structure of N=28 human BMSC colonies from six donors, each colony derived from a single cell, and trace their lineage trees up to the seventh generation. We confirm the presence of very significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneities, both in the topology of the lineages and in the replicative kinetics of the colonies. We also find that topology and kinetics are strongly correlated, consistent with the existence of regulating factors linking the sub-population of inactive cells, which uniquely determine a lineage's topology, and that of active cells, which are the sole responsible for the proliferation rate of the colony. Finally, we submit each colony to an entropy-based inheritance test, which measures the degree of non-random clustering of inactive cells within the same branches of the lineage, and find a clear signature of hereditary transmission of the probability of emergence of inactive cells in the largest majority of the experimental lineages.</description>

      <title>H-theorem at negative temperature: the random exchange model with bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random exchange kinetic models are widely employed to describe the conservative dynamics of large interacting systems. Due to their simplicity and generality, they are quite popular in several fields, from statistical mechanics to biophysics and economics. Here we study a version where bounds on the individual shares of the globally conserved quantity are introduced. We analytically show that this dynamics allows stationary states with population inversion, described by Boltzmann statistics at negative absolute temperature if the conserved quantity has the physical meaning of an energy. The proposed model provides therefore a privileged system for the study of thermalization toward a negative temperature state. First, the genuine equilibrium nature of the stationary state is verified by checking the detailed balance condition. Then, an H-theorem is proven, ensuring that such equilibrium condition is reached by a monotonic increase of the Boltzmann entropy. We also provide analytical and numerical evidence that a large intruder in contact with the system thermalizes, suggesting a practical way to design a thermal bath at negative temperature.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Langevin Equation with Uncertainty via Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pervasive across diverse domains, stochastic systems exhibit fluctuations in processes ranging from molecular dynamics to climate phenomena. The Langevin equation has served as a common mathematical model for studying such systems, enabling predictions of their temporal evolution and analyses of thermodynamic quantities, including absorbed heat, work done on the system, and entropy production. However, inferring the Langevin equation from observed trajectories is a challenging problem, and assessing the uncertainty associated with the inferred equation has yet to be accomplished. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that employs Bayesian neural networks for inferring Langevin equations in both overdamped and underdamped regimes. Our framework first provides the drift force and diffusion matrix separately and then combines them to construct the Langevin equation. By providing a distribution of predictions instead of a single value, our approach allows us to assess prediction uncertainties, which can help prevent potential misunderstandings and erroneous decisions about the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in inferring Langevin equations for various scenarios including a neuron model and microscopic engine, highlighting its versatility and potential impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed motion up a concentration gradient is crucial for the survival and maintenance of numerous biological systems, such as sperms moving towards an egg during fertilization or ciliates moving towards a food source. In these systems, chirality - manifested as a rotational torque - plays a vital role in facilitating directed motion. While systematic studies of active molecules in activity gradients exist, the effect of chirality remains little studied. In this study, we examine the simplest case of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle in a spatially varying activity field. We demonstrate that this minimal setup can exhibit rich emergent tactic behaviors, with the chiral torque serving as the tuning parameter. Notably, when the chiral torque is sufficiently large, even a small passive particle enables the system to display the desired accumulation behavior. Our results further show that in the dilute limit, this desired accumulation behavior persists despite the presence of excluded volume effects. Additionally, interconnected chiral active particles exhibit emergent chemotaxis beyond a critical chain length, with trimers and longer chains exhibiting strong accumulation at sufficiently high chiral torques. This study provides valuable insights into the design principles of hybrid bio-molecular devices of the future.</description>

      <title>Exact joint distributions of three global characteristic times for Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider three global characteristic times for a one-dimensional Brownian motion $x(\tau)$ in the interval $\tau\in [0,t]$: the occupation time $t_{\rm o}$ denoting the cumulative time where $x(\tau)&gt;0$, the time $t_{\rm m}$ at which the process achieves its global maximum in $[0,t]$ and the last-passage time $t_l$ through the origin before $t$. All three random variables have the same marginal distribution given by L\'evy's arcsine law. We compute exactly the pairwise joint distributions of these three times and show that they are quite different from each other. The joint distributions display rather rich and nontrivial correlations between these times. Our analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. Then we apply the DTWA method to investigate the system-size dependence of the scrambling time in strongly long-range interacting systems. We reveal that the scaling behavior of the scrambling time for large system sizes qualitatively changes depending on the interaction range. This work provides and demonstrates a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics involving more details than hydrodynamics is needed to formulate rate thermodynamics of the Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard system. The Boussinesq vector field is approached in the space of mesoscopic vector fields similarly as equilibrium sates are approached in externally unforced systems in the space of mesoscopic state variables. The approach is driven by gradient of a potential (called a rate entropy). This potential then provides the rate thermodynamics in the same way as the entropy provides thermodynamics for externally unforced systems. By restricting the investigation to a small neighborhood of the critical point we can use the rate-thermodynamic version of the Landau theory.</description>

Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes nonzero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. In this paper, by leveraging the large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point (QCP) triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. A remarkable discovery is that, despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the FTS form. This leads us to propose a generalized criterion for the validity of KZM and FTS with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to the strongly interacting Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusive contact between randomly driven colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation process of two driven colloidal suspensions in diffusive contact to a steady state, similar to thermalization. We start by studying a single suspension, subjecting it to random driving forces via holographic optical tweezers, which agitate it to a higher effective temperature. Interestingly, the effective temperature of the suspension, defined by the Einstein relation, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the driving frequency. Next, we follow the flux of particles between two such suspensions in diffusive contact, starting from a uniform density and relaxing to a state with zero net particle flux. The density remains uniform for systems with different frequencies but equal effective temperatures. At high driving frequencies, we show that the density distribution at steady state is determined by equating the ratio of the chemical potential to the effective temperature in both systems, mirroring thermal equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>Long-range angular correlations of particle displacements at a plastic-to-elastic transition in jammed amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how a flow turns into an amorphous solid is a fundamental challenge in statistical physics, during which no apparent structural ordering appears. In the athermal limit, the two states are connected by a well-defined jamming transition, near which the solid is marginally stable. A recent mechanical response screening theory proposes an additional transition above jamming, called a plastic-to-elastic transition here, separating anomalous and quasi-elastic mechanical behavior. Through numerical inflation simulations in two dimensions, we show that the onsets of long-range radial and angular correlations of particle displacements decouple, occurring respectively at the jamming and plastic-to-elastic transitions. The latter is characterized by a power-law diverging correlation angle and a power-law spectrum of the displacements along a circle. This work establishes two-step transitions on the mechanical properties during ``decompression melting'' of an athermal over-jammed amorphous solid, reminiscent of the two-step structural melting of a crystal in two dimensions. In contradistinction with the latter, the plastic-to-elastic transition exists also in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking meets average symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Limits of the Lindblad and non-Hermitian description of open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is well established that the dynamics of an open system is described accurately by the Lindblad master equation if the coupling to the bath is either in the weak or in the singular limit, it is not known whether this also extends to other coupling strengths. Here we use the exact solution of a microscopic system coupled to baths to gauge the validity of the Lindblad dynamics during a finite time evolution, and show that for a pure decay system, Lindbladian dynamics generally only holds in the weak and singular coupling limits. We also prove that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent in the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this equivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics for any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can only occur in the singular coupling limit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that exceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated system is comparable to the relaxation time scale.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a nontrivial generalization of the mechanism in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. We particularly reach two novel models, with one hosting all basic types of mobility edges and the other hosting all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit aspects of dynamics and stability of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. By a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, we show that localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold and that localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, the constants of motion in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation play a crucial role. An infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>
