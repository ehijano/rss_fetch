      <title>Locales as spaces in outer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let M be a transitive model of set theory and X be a space in the sense of M. Is there a reasonable way to interpret X as a space in V? A general theory due to Zapletal provides a natural candidate which behaves well on sufficiently complete spaces (for instance \v{C}ech complete spaces) but behaves poorly on more general spaces - for instance, the Zapletal interpretation does not commute with products. We extend Zapletal's framework to instead interpret locales, a generalization of topological spaces which focuses on the structure of open sets. Our extension has a number of desirable properties; for instance, localic products always interpret as spatial products. We show that a number of localic notions coincide exactly with properties of their interpretations; for instance, we show a locale is $T_U$ if and only if all its interpretations are $T_1$, a locale is $I$-Hausdorff if and only if all its interpretations are $T_2$, a locale is regular if and only if all its interpretations are $T_3$, and a locale is compact if and only if all its interpretations are compact.</description>

      <title>On cohomology of locally profinite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a locally profinite set of cardinality $\aleph_{\omega}$ with infinitely many first cohomology classes of which any distinct finite product does not vanish. Building on this, we construct the first example of a nondescendable faithfully flat map between commutative rings of cardinality $\aleph_{\omega}$ within Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory.</description>

      <title>Infinite Hat Problems and Large Cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Picture countably many logicians all wearing a hat in one of $\kappa$-many colours. They each get to look at finitely many other hats and afterwards make finitely many guesses for their own hat's colour. For which $\kappa$ can the logicians guarantee that at least one of them guesses correctly? This will be the archetypical hat problem we analyse and solve here. We generalise this by varying the amount of logicians as well as the number of allowed guesses and describe exactly for which combinations the logicians have a winning strategy.
  We also solve these hat problems under the additional restriction that their vision is restrained in terms of a partial order. Picture e.g.~countably many logicians standing on the real number line and each logician is only allowed to look at finitely many others in front of them.
  In many cases, the least $\kappa$ for which the logicians start losing can be described by an instance of the free subset property which in turn is connected to large cardinals. In particular, $\mathrm{ZFC}$ can sometimes not decide whether or not the logicians can win for every possible set of colours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a notion of reducibility for partial functions on the natural numbers, which we call subTuring reducibility. One important aspect is that the subTuring degrees correspond to the structure of the realizability subtoposes of the effective topos. We show that the subTuring degrees (that is, the realizability subtoposes of the effective topos) form a dense non-modular (thus, non-distributive) lattice. We also show that there is a nonzero join-irreducible subTuring degree (which implies that there is a realizability subtopos of the effective topos that cannot be decomposed into two smaller realizability subtoposes).</description>

      <title>FCA using the Concept Explorer in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we give a very short introduction to Formal Concept Analysis, accompanied by an example in order to build concept lattices from a context. We build the lattice using the Java-based software Concept Explorer (ConExp) in a recent version of Linux. Installing an appropriate Java version is necessary, because ConExp was developed some time ago using a Sun Java version, which is not open-source. As a result, it has been observed that ConExp will not build a lattice when started with an open-source Java version. Therefore, we also sketch the procedure we followed to install an appropriate Java version which makes ConExp work again, i.e., to "build lattices again". We also show how to start ConExp with a 32 bit Java version, which requires a few additional libraries.</description>

      <title>Spectral equivalences through nonstandard samplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce a process that generates, given Hilbert space $H$ and symmetric operator $A$, an embedding of $H$ into an $L_2$-space through which $A$ is extended by a multiplication operator. This process will depend on two parameters, the nonstandard sampling and the standard-biased scale.
  We will use that process to prove diverse versions of the general spectral theorem, showing its appeal. Furthermore, through landmark examples, we will observe that by carefully tweaking the two parameters, we can make the resulting spaces, embeddings and operators quite explicit and natural.</description>

      <title>Topoi of automata I: Four topoi of automata and regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both topos theory and automata theory are known for their multi-faceted nature and relationship with topology, algebra, logic, and category theory. This paper aims to clarify the topos-theoretic aspects of automata theory, particularly demonstrating through two main theorems how regular (and non-regular) languages arise in topos-theoretic calculation. First, it is shown that the four different notions of automata form four types of Grothendieck topoi, illustrating how the technical details of automata theory are described by topos theory. Second, we observe that the four characterizations of regular languages (DFA, Myhill-Nerode theorem, finite monoids, profinite words) provide Morita-equivalent definitions of a single Boolean-ringed topos, situating this within the context of Olivia Caramello's 'Toposes as Bridges.'
  This paper also serves as a preparation for follow-up papers, which deal with the relationship between hyperconnected geometric morphisms and algebraic/geometric aspects of formal language theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the existence of certain first-countable compact-like extensions is equivalent to the equality between corresponding cardinal characteristics of the continuum. For instance, $\mathfrak b=\mathfrak s=\mathfrak c$ if and only if every regular first-countable space of weight $&lt; \mathfrak c$ can be densely embedded into a regular first-countable countably compact space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that it is consistent relative to the consistency of a Mahlo cardinal that Martin's axiom holds at $\omega_2$, but the weak Kurepa Hypothesis fails. This answers a question posed by Honzik, Lambie-Hanson and Stejskalov\'a. The consistency result is obtained by constructing a model where the weak Kurepa Hypothesis fails in any c.c.c. forcing extension.</description>

      <title>The finitary partitions with $n$ non-singleton blocks of a set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partition is finitary if all its blocks are finite. For a cardinal $\mathfrak{a}$ and a natural number $n$, let $\mathrm{fin}(\mathfrak{a})$ and $\mathscr{B}_{n}(\mathfrak{a})$ be the cardinalities of the set of finite subsets and the set of finitary partitions with exactly $n$ non-singleton blocks of a set which is of cardinality $\mathfrak{a}$, respectively. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) that for all infinite cardinals $\mathfrak{a}$ and all non-zero natural numbers $n$, \[ (2^{\mathscr{B}_{n}(\mathfrak{a})})^{\aleph_0}=2^{\mathscr{B}_{n}(\mathfrak{a})} \] and \[ 2^{\mathrm{fin}(\mathfrak{a})^n}=2^{\mathscr{B}_{2^n-1}(\mathfrak{a})}. \] It is also proved consistent with $\mathsf{ZF}$ that there exists an infinite cardinal $\mathfrak{a}$ such that \[ 2^{\mathscr{B}_{1}(\mathfrak{a})}&lt;2^{\mathscr{B}_{2}(\mathfrak{a})}&lt;2^{\mathscr{B}_{3}(\mathfrak{a})}&lt;\cdots&lt;2^{\mathrm{fin}(\mathrm{fin}(\mathfrak{a}))}. \]</description>

      <description>arXiv:0909.0774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the ninth in a sequence on the structure of sets of solutions to systems of equations in free and hyperbolic groups, projections of such sets (Diophantine sets), and the structure of definable sets over free and hyperbolic groups. In the ninth paper we associate a Diophantine set with a definable set, and view it as the Diophantine envelope of the definable set. We use the envelope and duo limit groups that were used in proving stability of the theory of free and torsion-free hyperbolic groups [Se9], to study definable equivalence relations, and in particular, to classify imaginaries over these groups.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for the Logic of Bunched Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logic of bunched implications (BI) can be seen as the free combination of intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) and intuitionistic multiplicative linear logic (IMLL). We present here a base-extension semantics (B-eS) for BI in the spirit of Sandqvist's B-eS for IPL, deferring an analysis of proof-theoretic validity, in the sense of Dummett and Prawitz, to another occasion. Essential to BI's formulation in proof-theoretic terms is the concept of a `bunch' of hypotheses that is familiar from relevance logic. Bunches amount to trees whose internal vertices are labelled with either the IMLL context-former or the IPL context-former and whose leaves are labelled with propositions or units for the context-formers. This structure presents significant technical challenges in setting up a base-extension semantics for BI. Our approach starts from the B-eS for IPL and the B-eS for IMLL and provides a systematic combination. Such a combination requires that base rules carry bunched structure, and so requires a more complex notion of derivability in a base and a correspondingly richer notion of support in a base. One reason why BI is a substructural logic of interest is that the `resource interpretation' of its semantics, given in terms of sharing and separation and which gives rise to Separation Logic in the field of program verification, is quite distinct from the `number-of-uses' reading of the propositions of linear logic as resources. This resource reading of BI provides useful intuitions in the formulation of its proof-theoretic semantics. We discuss a simple example of the use of the given B-eS in security modelling.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a 'system' typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a 'resource semantics' of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 3: strong regularity and the vertex partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is part 3 in a series of papers about the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. We consider here the strong regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. This type of regular decomposition comes with two components, a partition of vertices, and a partition of pairs of vertices. We define two corresponding growth functions associated to a hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the pairs component. In this paper, we give an almost complete description of the possible growth rates for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$: constant, polynomial, between single and double exponential, or wowzer. The only existing lower bound constructions for this type of hypergraph regularity were due to Moshkovitz and Shapira, who constructed examples requiring a wowzer-type lower bound on the vertex component in a weaker type of hypergraph regularity. The results of this paper rely crucially on the fact that a slightly simpler construction can be used to produce a wowzer type lower bound for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$. The key ingredient in this simpler example is a lower bound construction for strong graph regularity due to Conlon and Fox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the fourth in a series of papers on the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we consider a form of regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs which was developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. Regular decompositions of this type involve two components, a partition on the vertex set and a partition on the pairs of vertices. To each hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, we associate two corresponding growth functions: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the pairs component. In this paper we consider the behavior of the function $L_{\mathcal{H}}$. We show any such function is either constant, bounded above and below by a polynomial, or bounded below by an exponential.</description>

Abstract: Cirquent calculus is a proof system with inherent ability to account for sharing subcomponents in logical expressions. Within its framework, this article constructs an axiomatization CL18 of the basic propositional fragment of computability logic the game-semantically conceived logic of computational resources and tasks. The nonlogical atoms of this fragment represent arbitrary so called static games, and the connectives of its logical vocabulary are negation and the parallel and choice versions of conjunction and disjunction. The main technical result of the article is a proof of the soundness and completeness of CL18 with respect to the semantics of computability logic.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact, connected manifold of positive dimension and let $\mathcal G\leq\textrm{Homeo}(M)$ be \emph{locally approximating} in the sense that for all open $U\subseteq M$ compactly contained in a single Euclidean chart of $M$, the subgroup $\mathcal G[U]$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal G$ supported in $U$ is dense in the full group of homeomorphisms supported in $U$. We prove that $\mathcal G$ interprets first order arithmetic, as well as a first order predicate that encodes membership in finitely generated subgroups of $\mathcal G$. As a consequence, we show that if $\mathcal G$ is not finitely generated, then no group elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ can be finitely generated. We show that many finitely generated locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms $\mathcal G$ of a manifold are prime models of their theories, and give conditions that guarantee any finitely presented group $G$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal G$. We thus recover some results of Lasserre about the model theory of Thompson's groups $F$ and $T$. Finally, we obtain several action rigidity result for locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms. If $\mathcal G$ acts in a locally approximating way on a compact, connected manifold $M$ then the dimension of $M$ is uniquely determined by the elementary equivalence class of $\mathcal G$. Moreover, if $\dim M\leq 3$ then $M$ is uniquely determined up to homeomorphism. In for general closed smooth manifolds, the homotopy type of $M$ is uniquely determined. In this way, we obtain a generalization of a well-known result of Rubin.</description>
