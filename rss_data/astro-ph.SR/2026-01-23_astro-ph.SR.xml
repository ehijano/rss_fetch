      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA). VII. Disk candidates around high-mass stars and evidence of anisotropic infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kinematics of condensations in 30 fields forming high-mass stars with ALMA at a high-resolution of ~0.08'' on average (~230 au). The presence of disks is important for feeding high-mass stars without feedback halting growth as their masses increase. In the search for velocity gradients resembling rotation that can reveal the presence of disks, we analyze the emission of gas tracers in 49 objects using CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and tentative detections of HNCO and cis-HCOOH. Most of the velocity distributions show velocity gradients indicative of rotation. We reveal a total of 32 disk candidates, the largest sample to date that has been uniformly analyzed at a few hundred au scales in the high-mass regime. Their position-velocity maps are generally asymmetric with one side brighter than the opposite. We successfully fit a power law to the position-velocity maps of the disk candidates and find indices between -0.5 (Keplerian rotation) and -1 (rotation under specific angular momentum conservation) with a median of -0.7. Under Keplerian rotation assumption, we estimate central masses, uncorrected for inclination, ranging between 7 to 45 M$_\odot$. Excluding outliers, the disk candidates are relatively more compact (&lt;200 au) and less massive (&lt;5 M$_\odot$) than previous results at coarser angular resolution. We calculate an average Toomre-$Q$ parameter and find that most are gravitationally unstable (median of 0.5). We conclude that these observations offer the first opportunity to separate the disk and envelope components of hot cores on a statistically significant sample, and confirm that anisotropic collapse plays an role in feeding high-mass (proto)stars.</description>

      <title>Solar twins in Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec I. Building a large catalog of Solar twins with ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abbreviated] Context. Solar twins, stars whose stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [M/H]) are very close to the Solar ones, offer a unique opportunity to investigate Galactic archaeology with very high accuracy and precision. However, most previous catalogs of Solar twins contain only a small number of objects (typically a few tens), and their selection functions are poorly characterized. Aims. We aim at building a large catalog of Solar twins from Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, providing model-driven, rather than data-driven, stellar parameters including ages, together with a well-characterized selection function. Methods. Using stellar parameters from the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalog, we selected Solar-twin candidates whose parameters lie within +- 200 K in Teff, +- 0.2 in log g, and +- 0.1 dex in [M/H] of the Solar values. Candidates unlikely to be genuine Solar twins were removed using Gaia flags and photometric constraints. We determined accurate ages for individual twins with a Bayesian isochrone-projection method, considering three combinations of parameters: Teff, [M/H], and either log g, M_G, or M_Ks. We also constructed a mock catalog to characterize the selection function. Results. Our final GSP-Spec Solar-twin catalog contains 6,594 stars. The mock catalog consisting of 75,588 artificial twins well reproduces the main characteristics of the observed catalog, especially for ages determined with M_G or M_Ks. To demonstrate the usefulness of our catalog, we compared chemical abundances [X/Fe] with age. We statistically confirmed the age--[X/Fe] relations for several species (e.g., Al, Si, Ca, and Y), demonstrating that trends previously identified in small but very high-precision samples persist in a much larger, independent sample. Conclusions. Our study bridges small high-precision Solar-twin samples and large data-driven ones, enabling demographic studies of Solar twins.</description>

      <title>The age sequence of young clusters in Perseus: Estimating ages from mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing ages for young clusters is key for properly tracking the star formation history of a region. In this paper we investigate a new approach to estimating ages for young populations, based on the well-founded assumption that the initial mass function is the same throughout a star forming cloud. We trial this method for six young clusters in the Perseus star forming region. For all six clusters, we construct new member samples in a homogeneous way using Gaia DR3. We estimate masses by comparing 2MASS photometry to theoretical isochrones, including Monte Carlo simulations to propagate the errors. We compare the mass distributions of the clusters for a range of plausible ages, looking for a combination of ages that results in indistinguishable mass distributions across the region. We find the best fit for ages of 1 Myr for NGC1333+Autochthe, 2 Myr for IC348, 2-3 Myr for Heleus, 3-4 Myr for Mestor, 4-5 Myr for Electryon+Cynurus, and 5-8 Myr for Alcaeus. All other combinations of ages are ruled out by this criterion. The established age sequence is consistent with the relative ages inferred from disc fractions, and broadly aligns with the age sequence determined in previous studies using isochrone fitting. We suggest that this approach can be a useful complement and cross-check to established methods to estimate ages in young populations.</description>

      <title>Supernova interactions with aspherical circumstellar material I: calculations of light curves, AB magnitudes, spectra, and polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an upgraded detailed numerical calculations of supernova (SN) interactions with significantly aspherical circumstellar matter (CSM), primarily formed as a disc or bipolar lobes. The circumstellar disc can arise as a result of, for example, mass transfer in a binary, while bipolar lobes can be the result of a violent pre-explosive ejection of matter, similar to the iconic cases of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs). We numerically simulate the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) behaviour of interaction processes using a 2D cylindrical version of the RHD code CASTRO. We then calculate light curves, spectral patterns, and polarisation profiles, all up to a relatively long time of two years after an SN shock breakout and from different directions, using the multidimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MC-RT) codes SEDONA and SIROCCO. We calculated a total of five models for the two aforementioned configurations of the surrounding CSM, for stratified density levels, comparing the simulated hydrodynamic behaviour and differences in their observable properties. RHD models exhibit similar behaviour to previous adiabatic models, but with a significantly slower expansion velocity. The calculated light curves show a relatively smooth evolution in SN-disc interaction, and declines and brightening in SN-lobes interaction. Comparing models with real events with a presumed similar physical process provides guidance for selecting a more accurate CSM configuration when simulating real situations.</description>

      <title>A compact object with a K type star companion in the solar neighborhood: a wide post common envelope binary with a white dwarf candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) plus a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain current prescriptions of common envelope evolution (CEE) and calibrate theoretical models of binary formation and evolution. Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($&gt;$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\,\geq\,0.58\,\rm M_{\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.</description>

      <title>The reason for the occurrence of W-type contact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For more than half a century, the puzzling W-type phenomenon in contact binaries has challenged astrophysicists. In these systems, the less massive component exhibits a higher surface temperature than its more massive companion, which is a reversal of the typical A-type configuration, where the more massive star is hotter. This counterintuitive temperature inversion defies the basic stellar physics and still lacks a widely accepted explanation. In this study, we assembled a sample of over 3,000 extensively observed contact binaries and derived their complete set of physical parameters. Our statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the occurrence of W-type contact binaries and the intensity and frequency of magnetic activities. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that magnetic activities are the primary driver of the W-type phenomenon and offers a compelling explanation for the observed transitions between the W-type and A-type.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis: Nucleosynthesis predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is one of the eleven known recurrent novae in our Galaxy. It was observed in outburst in 1866 and 1946, with additional likely eruptions recorded in 1217 and 1787. Given its predicted recurrence period of approximately 80 yr, the next outburst is anticipated to occur imminently, thus motivating a thorough examination of the main characteristics of this system. We present new hydrodynamic models of the explosion of T CrB for different combinations of parameters (i.e., the mass, composition, and initial luminosity of the white dwarf, the metallicity of the accreted matter, and the mass-transfer rate). We show that mass-accretion rates between 10-8 - 10-7 Msun yr-1 are required to trigger an outburst after 80 yr of accretion of solar-composition material onto white dwarfs with masses about 1.30 - 1.38 Msun. For lower white dwarf luminosities, less massive white dwarfs, or reduced metallicity in the accreted material, higher mass-accretion rates are required to drive an explosion within this timescale. A decrease in metallicity or initial white dwarf luminosity leads to higher accumulated masses and ignition pressures, resulting in more violent outbursts. These outbursts exhibit higher peak temperatures, higher ejected masses, and greater kinetic energies. Models computed for different white dwarf masses but identical initial luminosities reveal significant differences in the elemental abundances of a wide range of species, including Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Ar, K, Ca, and Sc. These compositional differences offer a potential diagnostic tool for constraining the parameter space and discriminating between the various T CrB models reported in this study.</description>

      <title>Interaction between the ejecta, the accretion disk, and the secondary star in the recurrent nova system U Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most efforts in the modeling of recurrent novae have centered on the initial phases of the explosion and ejection, overlooking the subsequent interaction of the ejecta, first with the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf and ultimately with the secondary star. To address this gap, a series of 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations was conducted. These simulations explored the dynamic interactions between the nova ejecta, accretion disk, and stellar companion within the framework of the recurrent nova system U Sco. Notably, the simulations incorporate rotation around the system's center of mass. The primary goal of these simulations was to qualitatively examine the impact of various model parameters, including ejecta mass, velocity, and density, as well as the mass and geometry of the accretion disk. Simulations reveal complete disruption and sweeping of the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf star for models with flared disks and Mejecta/Mdisk larger than 1. In contrast, V-shaped disks with a (constant) high initial density and Mejecta/Mdisk &lt; 1 partially survive the impact with the nova ejecta. A very minor chemical contamination of the secondary star is anticipated in the U Sco case based on the limited impact of nova ejecta particles on the subgiant in all simulations. Minor mass ejection from the subgiant's outer layers is observed during the late-stage collision with ejecta and disk material, with some particles ejected from the binary system and some accreted by the white dwarf.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear astrophysics aims at unraveling the cosmic origins of chemical elements and the physical processes powering stars. It constitutes a truly multidisciplinary field, that integrates tools, advancements, and accomplishments from theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry, and theoretical and experimental atomic and nuclear physics. For instance, the advent of high-energy astrophysics, facilitated by space-borne observatories, has ushered in a new era, offering a unique, panchromatic view of the universe (i.e., allowing multifrequency observations of stellar events); supercomputers are also playing a pivotal role, furnishing astrophysicists with computational capabilities essential for studying the intricate evolution of stars within a multidimensional framework; cosmochemists, through examination of primitive meteorites, are uncovering tiny fragments of stardust, shedding light on the physical processes operating in stars and on the mechanisms that govern condensation of stellar ejecta into solids; simultaneously, nuclear physicists managed to measure nuclear reactions at (or close to) stellar energies, using both stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. This paper provides a multidisciplinary view on nucleosynthesis accompanying stellar explosions, with a specific focus on thermonuclear supernovae, classical novae, and type I X-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Failed ejection and oscillations of a current-carrying filament balanced by gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the post-destabilization evolution of a filament in a gravity-balanced model. We adopt the filament model proposed by Solov'ev (2010), in which a dense filament is supported against gravity by the repulsive force between the filament current and its sub-photospheric image. We first performed an analytical investigation of this model. For the numerical study, we use a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that solves the MHD equations with the Lare2d numerical code. Results: In this filament model, analytical expressions are derived for the electric current density, plasma density, and their spatial distributions as functions of the model parameters. The total electric current and the filament weight are also calculated. For the numerical simulations, we constructed an equilibrium filament characterized by a magnetic field of $B_0$ = $10^{-3}$ T, mass density $\rho_0$ ~ 1.3 x $10^{-9}$ kg m$^{-3}$, and temperature T ~ 13000 K. The system was destabilized either by increasing the currents or by reducing the filament density, and its evolution was computed. In both destabilization regimes, the filament was ejected, then halted at a certain altitude, and subsequently fell back, repeating this cycle with a period of about 600 s. The maximum filament ejection velocity was approximately 80 and 40 km $s^{-1}$, respectively. Beneath the ejected filament a current sheet forms, where magnetic reconnection occurs. The maximum ejection altitudes were determined as functions of both the destabilizing currents and the degree of filament plasma dilution. Finally, we compared results of this MHD model with those of an ideal vacuum model and discussed all results.</description>

      <title>Does the solar oxygen abundance change over the solar cycle? An investigation into activity-induced variations of the O I infrared triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the solar oxygen abundance remains a central problem in astrophysics, as its accuracy is limited not only by models but also by systematics. While many of these factors have been thoroughly characterized, the effect of the solar activity cycle has so far remained unexplored. Due to its relative strength and accessibility, the O I infrared triplet is typically the primary choice for abundance studies. However, previous investigations have shown that abundances inferred from this triplet tend to be higher than expected on active stars, whereas such an overabundance effect is not observed for the much weaker forbidden O I 6300 \r{A} line. This raises the question of whether a similar trend can be found for the Sun. To address this question, we analyze two decades' worth of synoptic disk-integrated Sun-as-a-star datasets from the FEROS, HARPS-N, PEPSI, and NEID spectrographs, focusing on the infrared triplet (7772, 7774, 7775 \r{A}) and the forbidden O I 6300 \r{A} line. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the PEPSI observations allows us to detect a weak but significant variation in the equivalent widths of the infrared triplet, corresponding to about 0.01 dex difference in abundance between activity minimum and maximum. This value is significantly smaller than the typical uncertainties on the solar oxygen abundance. Due to higher scatter, no comparable trend is found in the other data sets. Based on these results, we conclude that within the typical uncertainties presented in other works, we can assume the inferred solar oxygen abundance to be stable across the solar cycle, but that this effect may be significant for other, more active stars.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Sample Validation of MagNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is starting to be used in almost every industry and academic research, and solar physics is no exception. A newly developed machine learning model named MagNet helps us to tackle some of the most serious challenges in data mining by generating transverse fields of solar active regions. Being trained on line-of-sight magnetograms from Michelson Doppler Imager at Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI), H{\alpha} maps from Big Bear Solar Observatory and Kanzelhohe Solar Observatory and vector magnetograms from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager at Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO/HMI), this model provides vector magnetograms in active regions for SOHO/MDI data covering the strong solar cycle 23. In this study, we performed out-of-sample validation of the MagNet model with data from Imaging Vector Magnetograph (IVM) at Mees Solar Observatory, which was not included in the training process. Our results show good correlation between the AI generated data and the observed vector magnetograms and therefore strengthen the confidence of implementing MagNet to the entire SOHO/MDI archive and future scientific analysis of the AI generated data.</description>

      <title>Gaia20fnr: A binary-lens microlensing event with full orbital motion revealed by four space telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microlensing event Gaia20fnr is a long-duration, non-caustic-crossing binary-lens event at high Galactic latitude. Triggered by a photometric rise detected by the Gaia space mission, the event was followed up with observations from multiple ground-based facilities and four space telescopes: Gaia, NEOWISE, Swift, and TESS. We characterize the Gaia20fnr microlensing system by determining the physical and orbital properties of the binary lens, the nature of the luminous source, and the kinematics of both the source and the lens. We employed a binary-lens microlensing model including full Keplerian orbital motion and annual microlens parallax to fit the photometric data. The event is best explained by a K2 giant source at $D_{\rm S} = 3.10 \pm 0.10\,\mathrm{kpc}$ lensed by a stellar binary composed of $M_{\rm L,1} = 0.46 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm L,2} = 0.52 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L} = 0.54 \pm 0.05\,\mathrm{kpc}$. The light curve exhibits strong signatures of orbital motion and requires a full Keplerian model with a period of $P = 0.67 \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{yr}$ and a radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $K_1 = 16.9 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Gaia20fnr is one of the few microlensing events for which a complete Keplerian binary-lens solution has been derived. The model can be tested with follow-up radial-velocity and high-resolution imaging observations as well as forthcoming Gaia DR4 and DR5 astrometric time-series data. Its long duration, multi-peak structure, and extensive coverage make it a benchmark for studying faint nearby low-mass binaries through microlensing.</description>

      <title>Formation and X-ray emission from hot bubbles in planetary nebulae - III. The impact of [Wolf-Rayet]-type winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and synthetic X-ray emission of hot bubbles within planetary nebulae (PNe) driven by the powerful winds of H-deficient, [Wolf-Rayet]([WR])-type stars. Our models, based on {\sc mesa} stellar evolution tracks for 1--3 M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, adopt a recent mass-loss rate prescription for [WR] stars and incorporate the enhanced radiative cooling of their C-rich material, comparing the results against standard H-rich PN models. The enhanced mass-loss in the [WR] models leads to an accelerated post-AGB evolution and a subsequent delay in hot bubble formation compared to their H-rich counterparts, as suggested by a previous work. By computing synthetic X-ray spectra that account for the mixed H-rich and H-deficient gas phases, we find that models incorporating [WR] winds exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities ($L_\mathrm{X}$) than their H-rich counterparts, but the emissivity-weighted plasma temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas converge to values of $T_\mathrm{X} = [1-3] \times 10^{6}$~K, regardless of whether the system follows a [WR]-type or an H-rich post-AGB evolutionary path. Our results reinforce previous suggestions that mixing is a key mechanism in generating the observed soft X-ray emission even for PN hosting [WR] central stars.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength ALMA view of gas and dust in binary protoplanetary system AS 205: Evidence of dust asymmetric distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of multi-wavelength dust emissions at 3.1\,mm and 1.3\,mm; along with molecular line emissions of CO(2--1), CO(3--2), \mbox{$^{13}$CO(3--2)}, and C$^{18}$O(3--2) at spatial resolutions of 7--45 AU towards the protoplanetary system AS 205. The dust emissions exhibit two distinct components of AS 205 N and AS 205 S, separated by 1.3 arcsec. While gas kinematics within the dust disk regions are dominated by Keplerian rotation, the more extended gas emission displays complex morphology and kinematics strongly affected by the binary gravitational interaction in the outer regions. The stellar masses of AS 205 N and AS 205 S are estimated at $0.78\pm0.19$\,M$_\odot$ and $1.93\pm0.86$\,M$_\odot$, respectively. Azimuthal variation is observed in the spectral index distribution of both disks. In AS 205 N, the spectral index minimum in the southwest is coincident with the peaks of CO($2-1$), CO($3-2$), and $^{13}$CO($3-2$) integrated intensity and the relative position of its southern counterpart. On the other hand, the spectral index distribution in \ass~exhibits two prominent maxima, with the one in the northeast aligning with the peak of $^{13}$CO($3-2$), and the peak in the south coinciding with local maxima in CO($2-1$) and CO($3-2$) azimuthal profiles. These results suggest a correlation between dust grain size and/or optical depth with the gas distributions. Dust-trapping along the spiral arms possibly contributes to the spectral index minima in AS 205 N; however, the observed asymmetry across both disks suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Cyclic sunspot activity during the first millennium CE as reconstructed from radiocarbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solar activity, dominated by the 11-year cyclic evolution, has been observed directly since 1610. Before that, indirect cosmogenic proxy data are used to reconstruct it over millennia. Recently, the precision of radiocarbon measurements has improved sufficiently to allow reconstructing solar activity over millennia. Aims. The first detailed reconstruction of solar activity, represented by annual sunspot numbers, is presented for 1-969 CE. Methods. The reconstruction of sunspot numbers from D14C was performed using a physics-based method involving several steps: using a carbon-cycle box model, the 14C production rate, corrected for the geomagnetic shielding, was computed from the measured data; The open solar magnetic flux was computed using a model of the heliospheric cosmic-ray modulation; Sunspot numbers were calculated using a model of the evolution of the Sun's magnetic field. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was used to account for different sources of uncertainty. Results. Annual sunspot numbers were reconstructed for the first millennium CE. This period includes one extreme solar event of 774 CE and one Grand solar minimum of 650-730 CE. We could identify 91 solar cycles, of which 26 were well-defined, while 24 and 41 were reasonably and poorly defined, respectively. The mean cycle length was 10.6 years, but the lengths of individual cycles vary between 8 and 15 years. The existence of empirical Waldmeier's relations remains inconclusive. No significant periodicities were found beyond the 11-year cycle. Conclusions. This work fills the gap in the solar cycle statistics between the previously reconstructed first millennium BCE and the second millennium CE, providing vital constraints for the solar dynamo and irradiance models. A consistent 3-millennium-long reconstruction of sunspot numbers, based on a composite multi-proxy cosmogenic record, is pending.</description>

      <title>Evidence for stellar contamination and water absorption in NGTS-5b's transmission spectra with GTC/OSIRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy serves as a valuable tool for probing atmospheric absorption features in the terminator regions of exoplanets. Stellar surface heterogeneity can introduce wavelength-dependent contamination that complicates the interpretation of planetary spectra. We aim to investigate the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn NGTS-5b through optical transmission spectroscopy. Two transits were observed with the low-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Chromatic transit light curves were modeled to derive optical transmission spectra and multiple Bayesian spectral retrievals were performed to characterize the atmospheric properties. Model comparisons provide strong evidence for contamination from unocculted stellar spots. A joint retrieval of the transmission spectra, assuming equilibrium chemistry, indicates a relatively clear atmosphere with a sub-solar C/O ratio of $&lt;$0.22 (90% upper limit) and a low metallicity of $0.10^{+0.34}_{-0.05} \times$ solar. Retrievals assuming free chemistry yield strong evidence for the presence of $\rm H_2O$, with its abundance constrained to $\log X_{\mathrm{H_2O}} = -0.79^{+0.14}_{-0.17}$. However, the abundances of other species remain unconstrained due to the limited optical wavelength coverage. The discrepancies between the two NGTS-5b transit spectra can be attributed to varying levels of stellar contamination. NGTS-5b thus appears to host a relatively clear, water-rich atmosphere, pending confirmation from additional observations of molecular bands in the infrared.</description>

      <title>A 2 au resolution view by ALMA of the planet-hosting WISPIT 2 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present deep, high spatial resolution interferometric observations of 0.88 mm continuum emission from the TYC 5709-354-1 system, hereafter WISPIT 2, obtained with the goal of detecting circumplanetary emission in the vicinity of the newly discovered WISPIT 2b planet. Observations with the most extended baseline configuration offered by ALMA, achieving an angular resolution of $25 \times 17$ mas ($3.3 \times 2.2$ au), revealed a single, narrow ring with a deprojected radius of 144.4 au and width of 7.2 au, and no evidence of circumplanetary emission within the cavity. Injection and recovery tests demonstrate that these observations can rule out point-like emission at the location of WISPIT 2b brighter than $\approx 45$ $\mu$Jy at the $3\sigma$ level. While these data can rule out PDS 70c like circumplanetary emission, the upper limit is consistent with empirical mass-flux relationships extrapolated from the stellar regime. Visibility modeling of the continuum ring confirms that WISPIT 2b lies significantly interior to the mm dust ring, raising doubts about the ability of WISPIT 2b to be the only driver of the dust structure. Possible solutions include either another lower mass companion, residing between WISPIT 2b and the cavity edge, likely in the gap seen by SPHERE at $\sim130$ au, or that WISPIT 2b is either substantially more massive than IR-photometry based estimates ($\sim15$ $M_{\rm Jup}$) or on a moderately eccentric orbit. The combination of observations sensitive to the gas and dust distributions on larger spatial scales and dedicated hydrodynamical modeling will help differentiate between scenarios.</description>

      <title>HE0144-4657: A Carbon-Enhanced Ultra Metal-Poor Star ([Fe/H] ~ -4.1) from the Helmi Stream Disrupted Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of HE0144-4657, an ultra metal-poor, CNO-enhanced star dynamically associated with the Helmi Stream disrupted dwarf-galaxy remnant. This star was first identified as a carbon-enhanced, metal-poor star candidate from the Hamburg/ESO objective-prism survey, then followed up with medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy. At [Fe/H]=-4.11, HE0144-4657 is the lowest metallicity star found in a stellar stream to date. Its chemistry is consistent with field halo stars in the same metallicity regime, and the light-element (atomic number Z&lt;=30) chemical abundance pattern suggests that HE0144-4657 is a bona-fide second-generation star with a possible Population III progenitor in the 50Msun mass range with low explosion energy. One possible scenario for the origin of HE0144-4657 is that it was formed in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy accreted by the Helmi Stream progenitor system before merging with the Milky Way. This discovery provides further evidence for the extragalactic origin of carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and for the specific environments conducive to their formation.</description>

  seleno-, thio- and monomeric formic acids and that of their three dimeric species, based on multidimensional calculations in the
  gas-phase, from 10~K to 300~K as a guide to the matrix reactions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the recent high-accretion state of the recurrent nova T CrB: HST, Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) approaches its next predicted thermonuclear eruption, it is currently exhibiting a "super-active state" (SAS) characterized by enhanced multiwavelength emission similar to the behavior recorded prior to the 1946 outburst. We present a multiwavelength analysis of the SAS and the subsequent "faint state" using observations from HST, Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton. Our results indicate that the SAS was driven by an increase in the mass accretion rate, which caused the accretion disk's boundary layer to become optically thick. A weighted least squares regression analysis quantifies the evolution of the accretion components, displaying a highly significant (4.5$\sigma$) increase in the luminosity of the optically thin cooling flow (L$_{cf}$) and a marginal (2.58$\sigma$) decrease in the optically thick boundary layer luminosity (L$_{bb}$) as the system transitioned into the faint state. We find that this dimming is consistent with an intrinsic change in the accretion flow rather than dust obscuration, supported by the lack of infrared excess and the stability of the 2175 \AA\ feature. Additionally, a time-series analysis using autoregressive modeling to account for correlated red noise revealed no significant periodicities, thereby disputing the previously reported $\sim$6000 s signal. These findings suggest that the pre-outburst evolution of T CrB is characterized by significant changes in the accretion disk structure and boundary layer, providing a self-consistent physical framework for the system's behavior as it approaches eruption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a long-acknowledged deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter old stars within a few arc seconds of Sgr A*. We explore whether this could be due to tidal stripping by the central black hole. This requires putting the stars onto highly eccentric orbits, for which we evaluate diffusion by both scalar resonant and non-resonant relaxation of the orbital angular momentum. We conclude that tidal stripping does not discriminate sufficiently between main-sequence and red giant stars. While the tidal loss cone increases with stellar radius, the rate of diffusion into the loss cone increases only logarithmically, whereas the lifetime on the red giant branch decreases more rapidly than $R_*^{-1}$. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stellar collisions are a more likely explanation for the deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter ones.</description>

      <title>Multi-color characterization of optically invisible FU Orionis-type outbursts: Demonstration and prospects for the WINTER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the proto-stellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on i) their proximity to star-forming regions, ii) large amplitude (2-4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and iv) "mixed-temperature" infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor which we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits $\gtrsim 100\times$ fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object (YSO) outbursts. We highlight the capabilities of the Galactic Plane survey of the recently commissioned WINTER observatory in addressing the poorly understood FUor population with its unique combination of real-time detection capabilities, multi-color sensitivity, weekly cadence, and wide area coverage.</description>

Abstract: The Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission is a NASA Small Explorer to determine the cross-scale processes that unify the solar corona and heliosphere. PUNCH has two science objectives: (1) understand how coronal structures become the ambient solar wind, and (2) understand the dynamic evolution of transient structures, such as coronal mass ejections, in the young solar wind. To address these objectives, PUNCH uses a constellation of four small spacecraft in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, to collect linearly polarized images of the K corona and young solar wind. The four spacecraft each carry one visible-light imager in a 1+3 configuration: a single Narrow Field Imager solar coronagraph captures images of the outer corona at all position angles, and at solar elongations from 1.5 degrees (6 R$_\odot$) to 8 degrees (32 R$_\odot$); and three separate Wide Field Imager heliospheric imagers together capture views of the entire inner solar system, at solar elongations from 3 degrees (12 R$_\odot$) to 45 degrees (180 R$_\odot$) from the Sun. PUNCH images include linear-polarization data, to enable inferring the three-dimensional structure of visible features without stereoscopy. The instruments are matched in wavelength passband, support overlapping instantaneous fields of view, and are operated synchronously, to act as a single ``virtual instrument'' with a 90 degree wide field of view, centered on the Sun. PUNCH launched in March of 2025 and began science operations in June of 2025. PUNCH has an open data policy with no proprietary period, and PUNCH Science Team Meetings are open to all.</description>

      <title>On the Short Dissipation Scales and Current-Sheet Properties of Low-Coronal EUV Brightenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar Orbiter EUV observations reveal ubiquitous small-scale brightenings in the quiet-Sun low corona. We analyze the spatial and temporal dissipation scales of these events with a focus on the formation, evolution, and dissipation of associated current sheets. The brightenings are observed at heights of 1-5 Mm and span energies of 10^20 - 10^24 erg, well below the classical nanoflare regime, with the lowest-energy brightenings preferentially originating in the lowest coronal layers. Two distinct dissipation regimes are identified: impulsive brightenings with timescales of 1-10 s, consistent with fast, Alfvenic magnetic reconnection in low-beta plasma, and longer-lived heating episodes lasting 10-100 s, indicative of slower, resistive current-sheet dissipation under higher-beta conditions. The observed dissipation scales suggest a transition from kinetic-scale reconnection to macroscopic current-sheet heating in the low corona. These results support a multi-scale energy-release framework and highlight the role of low-altitude, small-scale current-sheet dissipation in quiet-Sun coronal heating.</description>

      <title>A Not-So-Compact Companion: Massive, Oversize White Dwarf in a Post-Common Envelope Eclipsing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a detailed characterization of 2M07515777+1807352, a post-common envelope eclipsing binary system with a 10.3 d, nearly, but not quite, circular orbit (e = 0.02). This system consists of a massive white dwarf (WD) ($1.08$ M$_{\odot}$) and a 4400 K main-sequence companion (0.66 M$_{\odot}$). This WD is among the most massive known within post-common envelope binary systems. We also find, through both spectral energy distribution and $\it{TESS}$ light curve analyses, that the WD has a radius of $1.54\pm 0.07 R_{\oplus}$, roughly $12\sigma$ larger than the expected value from WD mass-radius relationships. Both the Lomb-Scargle analysis and the $v \sin{i}$ of the system indicate the main-sequence companion to be super-synchronously rotating at a period of $\sim$6 days, which may suggest accretion occurred during the evolution of the system. This binary also shares similar physical characteristics with six other post-common envelope systems hosting massive WDs, which may point to a shared formation pathway. We model the history of this system with COSMIC and find that it likely formed through an episode of common envelope evolution following the onset of mass transfer when the progenitor primary was on either the early or the thermally pulsing stages of the asymptotic giant branch. As a result of its properties, the study of 2M07515777+1807352 can provide new insights regarding many key outstanding questions in our understanding of common envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dynamos in a collapsing cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields is crucial for understanding the observed magnetization of stars and galaxies. Turbulent dynamo is the primary mechanism responsible for that but the understanding of its action in a collapsing environment is still rudimentary and relies on limited numerical experiments. We develop an analytical framework and perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of small-scale and large-scale dynamos in a collapsing turbulent cloud. This approach is also applicable to expanding environments and facilitates the application of standard dynamo theory to evolving systems. Using a supercomoving formulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we demonstrate that dynamo action in a collapsing background leads to a super-exponential growth of magnetic fields in time, significantly faster than the exponential growth seen in stationary turbulence. The enhancement is mainly due to the increasing eddy turnover rate during the collapse, which boosts the instantaneous growth rate of the dynamo. We also show that the scaling of final saturated magnetic field strength with density robustly exceeds the expectation from considerations of pure flux-freezing. Apart from establishing a formal framework for studying magnetic field evolution in collapsing (or expanding) turbulent plasmas, these findings suggest that during star and galaxy formation magnetic fields can become dynamically relevant much earlier than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the Origin of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers with Gravitational-wave Spin Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim9\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models (Bayes factor $\ln\mathcal{B}&gt;3$) after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim63\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

      <title>Light Travel Time Effects in Kilonova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo -- commonly attributed to strontium -- possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light -- and therefore the light travel time to an observer -- contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.</description>

      <title>On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.</description>
