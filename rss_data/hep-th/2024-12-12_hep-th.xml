      <title>Black Hole Information, Replica Wormholes, and Macroscopic Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this invited review, we discuss the evaporation of a black hole, with emphasis on the resulting macroscopically distinct patterns of Hawking radiation. The density matrix of this radiation can approach a pure final state in the form of a highly entangled macroscopic superposition state. We note that this exact property is exhibited in replica wormhole calculations, and also in quantum hair effects on Hawking radiation amplitudes. Finally, we revisit the information paradox (Mathur's theorem and firewalls), showing that it can be resolved by macroscopic entanglement.</description>

      <title>Equivariant localization for $D=4$ gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric solutions of $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ Euclidean gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets. Such solutions admit an R-symmetry Killing vector, $\xi$, constructed as a bilinear in the Killing spinor. The Killing spinor bilinears can also be used to construct polyforms that are equivariantly closed under the action of the equivariant exterior derivative $\mathrm{d}_\xi=\mathrm{d}-\xi\mathbin{\rule[.2ex]{.4em}{.03em}\rule[.2ex]{.03em}{.9ex}}\,$. This allows one to compute various flux integrals and the on-shell action using localization, without solving any supergravity equations, just assuming the supersymmetric solutions exist. The flux integrals allow one to obtain important UV-IR relations, relating fixed point data in the bulk to data on the asymptotic AdS boundary, allowing one to express the gravitational free energy in terms of boundary SCFT data. We illustrate the formalism with a number of examples, including classes of solutions which are unlikely to ever be constructed in closed form.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained Bootstrap of Quantum Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>SymTFTs and Non-Invertible Symmetries of 6d (2,0) SCFTs of Type $D$ from M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit 6d (2,0) SCFTs of type $D_N$ and their realization in M-theory, focusing on absolute variants of these theories and on their global finite 0- and 2-form symmetries. We derive the 7d SymTFT capturing these global symmetries from M-theory, both from the point of view of the low-energy supergravity action on $AdS_7\times \mathbb{RP}^4$ and from M2- and M5-branes giving rise to its topological operators. Along the way, results by Gukov, Hsin, and Pei are extended by keeping track of an additional 7d $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge field, associated to the outer automorphism of the $D_N$ algebra. In particular, we find an interplay of non-invertible symmetries and mixed anomalies for absolute 6d (2,0) $D_{4k}$ SCFTs with $k\ge 1$. We highlight several subtle points related to the non-orientability of $\mathbb{RP}^4$, the half-integral $G_4$-flux that threads it, and the non-commutativity of fluxes. All these also play an essential role in a holographic derivation of the anomaly polynomial of 6d (2,0) $D_N$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Massive Inflationary Amplitudes: Differential Equations and Complete Solutions for General Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and solve a complete system of differential equations for general tree-level inflation correlators with an arbitrary number of massive scalar exchanges and time-dependent couplings. Any massive tree correlators can be uniquely fixed by solving this system of equations with appropriate boundary conditions. We take a hybrid approach to solve this system, using the differential equation to get the inhomogeneous solution and the bulk time integrals to determine the homogeneous solution. Altogether, we obtain analytical results for all tree-level massive inflation correlators with generic kinematics, expressed as multivariate hypergeometric series of energy ratios. The result can be neatly organized as a sum of the completely inhomogeneous solution, which we call the massive family tree, and all of its cuts. As simple applications, we provide full analytical expressions for tree correlators with one, two, and three massive exchanges.</description>

      <title>Hidden gauge invariances of torsion theories: closed algebras and absence of ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possible affine gauge transformations of the torsion tensor that make up Lie algebras. We find two such non-trivial structures, in which the gauge parameters are a $2$-form and a scalar. The first one gives rise to a non-abelian Lie algebra that is isomorphic to the Lorentz algebra, and which commutes with the latter. By linearizing this new gauge transformation we single out the gauge-invariant field variables on a flat background. Then, taking into account the most general power-counting renormalizable action of the torsion and imposing gauge invariance, we are able to find an invariant action that only has two free parameters. The torsion field equations of the resulting action are compatible with General Relativity in the torsionfree limit. Then, employing the spin-parity decompositions and the path integral method, we show that the theory, supplemented by the higher-derivative and Einstein-Hilbert actions, is free from kinematical ghosts, while it has a tachyonic scalar mode. Eventually, we comment on the technical difficulties that one will encounter when calculating the divergent part of the $1$-loop effective action.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity Calls for An Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the consistency of a perturbative definition of the S-matrix in a particular class of non-Lagrangian theories. We focus on the $p$-form theories proposed in \cite{Broccoli:2021pvv}, which are fully defined by "third-way" consistent equations of motion. Using the perturbiner method, we show that the unitarity is absent even at the tree level. We then pin down a unique modification of the equations of motion that restores unitarity. The trade-off is the reinstatement of an underlying Lagrangian, which we recognize as the higher-dimensional generalization of the Freedman-Townsend (FT) model. Finally, we discuss conserved currents in third-way theories and show they all follow from parent currents in the FT model. In particular, we point out the existence of a higher-ranked global symmetry, which signals that the FT model is compatible with the existence of brane-like charged objects in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Anomalies and D-branes in the Dabholkar-Park background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider D-branes in the Dabholkar-Park (DP) background, a $9$d orientifold theory obtained by gauging symmetry in the type~IIB string theory compactified on a circle. Using anomalies in the world-sheet theory, we provide physical insights into the classification of stable D-branes by relative KR-theory. The nature, such as stability, of D-branes wrapping along the compactified circle can be extracted from information about $1$d Majorana fermions on the boundary of the world-sheet. These Majorana fermions need to be introduced to consistently perform the GSO projection and the orientifold. We also construct D-brane states in the DP background. The spectrum of D-branes characterized by the relative KR-theory is correctly reproduced from the D-brane states.</description>

      <title>On the photon mass generation in Rarita-Schwinger QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the dynamical mass generation for the photon in Rarita-Schwinger QED. We focus our attention on the cases of $\omega=2,3$ dimensional spacetime. In these frameworks, it is well known that in the usual QED, the photon field (dynamically) acquires a gauge invariant mass (the Schwinger and Chern-Simons mass, respectively). We wish to scrutinize this phenomenon in terms of the Rarita-Schwinger fields. The presence of higher-derivative terms is shown as the leading contributions to the $1$PI function $\langle AA \rangle$ at one-loop order. We study the pole structure of the photon's complete propagator to unveil the main effects of the Rarita-Schwinger fields on the photon's mass. In addition, we present some remarks about the renormalizability of this model (in different dimensions) due to the presence of higher-derivative corrections at one-loop.</description>

      <title>States and IR divergences in factorization algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several choices of states. In factorization algebras, we often use a natural augmentation state $\langle-\rangle_{\rm aug}$. In physics, we use a state given by compactification of spacetime $\langle-\rangle_{\rm cptf}$, or a state corresponding Schwartz boundary condition $\langle-\rangle_{\rm Sch}$. At first glance, the relation between these three states is not so clear.
  In this paper, propose a definition of compactification method in factorization algebras and give a way to treat IR divergences in massless theory. As a result, we see the three sates are equivalent both in massive theory and massless theory.</description>

      <title>On BRST Lagrangian formulation of massless higher spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is dedicated to the blessed memory of Professor Vladislav Gavrilovich Bagrov, an outstanding Russian scientist in the area of theoretical and mathematical physics. He had a great influence on the formation of the scientific interests dozens of scientists in Tomsk and Russia as a whole. Two of the authors of this paper (I.L.B and V.A.K) are to one degree or another grateful to Professor V.G. Bagrov for comprehensive support in the initial period of their scientific career. Two other authors (S.A.F. and A.P.I.) are familiar with and use the work of scientists from the Tomsk School of Theoretical Physics, founded by Professor V.G. Bagrov. The paper is devoted to certain aspects of the higher-spin field theory, which were mainly initiated and continued during of I.L.B and V.A.K work in Tomsk. We demonstrate in details the simplicity and clearity of the Lagrangian formulation for free four-dimensional massless higher-spin fields within the universal BRST approach, while describing these fields in terms of two-component spin-tensors.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_4$ superspace and supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $N=1$ superspace, AdS$_4$ supersymmetry is realized as the non-linear super coordinate transformations. The fermionic coordinates form a faithful non-linear representation of supersymmetry on their own. By introducing an auxiliary scalar coordinate, this representation is reformulated as a 5-dimensional linear representation, i.e., the superspinor representation. New linear representations are constructed by tensor products of multiple superspinors. Especially, the superspace bosonic coordinates are embedded in the supervector representation, which is the traceless symmetric part of the bi-superspinor representation. Based on these linear representations, the $N=1$ AdS$_4$ supergravity action can be reproduced in a manifestly supersymmetry-covariant way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the black hole solution of the Einstein-Yang-Mills model incorporating a non-minimal coupling between the Ricci tensor and the Yang-Mills field strength tensor using a perturbative method. We then explore the thermodynamic phase transitions of the black hole within an extended phase space, examining both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Our findings reveal that altering the sign of the perturbation coefficient $\lambda$ leads to a significant shift in the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole, transitioning between Van der Waals-like fluid phase transitions and Hawking-Page-like transitions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a string on a Jordanian deformation of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ spacetime. This model belongs to the larger class of Homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations, which preserve classical integrability in the sense that one can construct an explicit Lax connection. To study the scattering of bosonic worldsheet excitations, we fix light-cone gauge and expand around a pointlike classical solution that reduces to the BMN vacuum in the undeformed limit. Our analysis shows that the light-cone gauge-fixed Hamiltonian, under a perturbative field expansion, includes cubic terms that give rise to non-trivial cubic processes for physical particles. We discuss this unexpected result in relation to the property of Lax integrability of the sigma-model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study high-energy scattering at fixed angle in the planar limit of non-Abelian gauge field theories from type IIB superstring theory scattering amplitudes. Firstly, we consider four-glueball scattering described in terms of the four-dilaton string theory scattering amplitude. We explicitly calculate some angular integrals of four scalar spherical harmonics on the five sphere leading to selection rules for several scattering processes. Then, we consider the high-energy limit of the four-dilatino scattering amplitude in type IIB superstring theory, which allows to describe four spin-1/2 fermions scattering in the dual gauge field theory. In both cases the partonic structure of the scattering cross sections is obtained. The Regge behavior is also obtained. In addition, we study certain related aspects by considering the effective action constructed from IIB supergravity.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and DC conductivity of 2D anisotropic fluids from axion holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>pp-Waves and the Hidden Symmetries of Black Hole Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two interesting classes of trapped null geodesics in any black hole spacetime: those that lie on the photon ring and those that generate the horizon. Recent work introduced a "near-ring" scaling limit that exhibits the emergent symmetries of the eikonal quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum associated to the photon ring. This analysis was reformulated geometrically by Fransen using the Penrose limit, which produces pp-waves from geodesics. We elaborate on and generalize various aspects of this construction for the Schwarzschild black hole. We also discuss the Penrose limit onto the horizon generators. This second limit, although technically simpler, also displays emergent near-horizon symmetries that explain the equally-spaced overtones of the highly-damped QNM spectrum. In both examples, symmetry considerations distinguish the QNM solutions from the scattering states and produce overtones as descendants.</description>

      <title>A stress tensor for asymptotically flat spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a procedure for calculating the boundary stress tensor of a gravitational theory in asymptotic flat spacetime. As a case study, the stress tensor correctly reproduces the Brown-York charges for the Kerr blackhole i.e. mass and angular momentum. In asymptotic flat spacetime, there are asymptotic symmetries called BMS symmetries. We also compute the charges associated with these symmetries with the proposed stress tensor. The asymptotic charges can be compared with the Wald-Zoupas method. Our result for the stress tensor can be interpreted as the expectation value for the boundary stress tensor.</description>

      <title>Primitive asymptotics in $\phi^4$ vector theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding conjecture in $\phi^4_4$ theory is that primitive graphs dominate the beta function asymptotically at large loop order in the minimal-subtraction scheme. Here we investigate this issue by exploiting additional combinatorial structure coming from an extension to vectors with $O(N)$ symmetry. For the 0-dimensional case, we calculate the $N$-dependent generating function of primitive graphs and its asymptotics, including arbitrarily many subleading corrections. We find that the leading asymptotic growth rate becomes visible only above $\approx 25$ loops, while data at lower order is suggestive of a wrong asymptotics. Our results also yield the exact asymptotics of Martin invariants.
  In 4D, each graph comes with a nontrivial Feynman integral, its period. We give bounds on the degree in $N$ for primitive and non-primitive graphs, and construct the primitive graphs of highest degree explicitly. We calculate the 4D primitive beta function numerically up to 17 loops. The qualitative behaviour is similar to the 0D series, with a small but systematic tendency for the 4D data to grow faster with $N$, indicating a correlation between periods and $O(N)$-symmetry factors. The zeros of the 4D primitive beta function approach their asymptotic locations quickly, but, like in 0D, the growth rate of the 4D primitive beta function does not match its asymptotics even at 17 loops.
  Our results improve on the knowledge of asymptotics in QFT by providing concrete analytic and numerical values, and putting individual observables into a broader context of $\phi^4_4$ theory in 0D and 4D. We demonstrate that even if certain quantities are in agreement with the asymptotics already below 10 loops, this must not be mistaken as evidence that overall an asymptotic regime has been reached.</description>

      <title>Non-local positivity bounds: islands in Terra Incognita</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The requirements of unitarity and causality lead to significant constraints on the Wilson coefficients of a EFT expansion, known as positivity bounds. Their standard derivation relies on the crucial assumption of polynomial boundedness on the growth of scattering amplitudes in the complex energy plane, which is a property satisfied by local QFTs, and by weakly coupled string theory in the Regge regime. The scope of this work is to clarify the role of locality by deriving generalized positivity bounds under the assumption of exponential boundedness, typical of non-local QFTs where the Froissart-Martin bound is usually not satisfied.Using appropriately modified dispersion relations, we derive new constraints and find regions in the EFT parameter space that do not admit a local UV completion. Furthermore, we show that there exist ETFs that satisfy IR causality and at the same time can admit a non-local UV completion, provided that the energy scale of non-locality is of the same order or smaller than the EFT cutoff. Finally, we provide explicit examples of non-perturbative amplitudes that simultaneously satisfy the properties of exponential boundedness, unitarity and causality. Our results have far-reaching implications for the question of the uniqueness of string theory as the only consistent ultraviolet completion beyond the framework of local QFT.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are expanded notes for a short series of lectures, presented at the University of Luxembourg in 2017, giving an introduction to some of the ideas of supersymmetry and supergeometry. In particular, we start from some motivating facts in physics, pass to the theory of supermanifolds, then to spinors, ending up at super-Minkowski space-times. We examine some salient mathematical issues with understanding supersymmetry in a classical setting and make no attempt to discuss phenomenologically interesting models. Moreover, the presentation is "light" in the sense that nothing is carefully proved. The audience of the seminars ranged from Ph.D. students to more experienced postdocs in mathematics. The audience was assumed to have a working knowledge of differential geometry, elementary category theory, and basic ideas from classical &amp; quantum mechanics. No knowledge of supersymmetry and supergeometry is assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the bounds on Wilson coefficients of the Higgs effective field theory (HEFT) mandated by unitarity and analyticity. These positivity constraints can be projected into the space of the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) as HEFT$\,\supset\,$SMEFT. Doing so reveals a subspace allowed by the HEFT but forbidden by SMEFT positivity, thereby identifying a region that could herald the use of the wrong EFT rather than a pathological UV. Restricting to custodial symmetric dimension-eight Higgs operators, there is a unique pair within the SMEFT where this concept can be sharply realized and directly probed at colliders.</description>

      <title>Boundary transitions from a single round of measurements on gapless quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements can qualitatively alter correlations and entanglement emerging in gapless quantum matter. We show how a single round of measurements on gapless quantum systems can, upon rotating the measurement basis, induce non-trivial transitions separating regimes displaying universal characteristics governed by distinct boundary conformal field theories. We develop the theory of such `measurement-induced boundary transitions' by investigating a gapless parent of the one-dimensional cluster state, obtained by appropriately symmetrizing a commuting projector Hamiltonian for the latter. Projective measurements on the cluster state are known to convert the wavefunction, after post-selection or decoding, into a long-range-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Similar measurements applied to the gapless parent (i) generate long-range order coexisting with power-law correlations when post-selecting for uniform outcomes, and (ii) yield power-law correlations distinct from those in the pre-measurement state upon decoding. In the post-selection scenario, rotating the measurement basis preserves long-range order up until a critical tilt angle marking a measurement-induced boundary transition to a power-law-ordered regime. Such a transition -- which does not exist in the descendant cluster state -- establishes new connections between measurement effects on many-body states and non-trivial renormalization-group flows. We extend our analysis to tricritical Ising and three-state Potts critical theories, which also display measurement-induced boundary transitions, and propose general criteria for their existence in other settings.</description>

Abstract: Using the framework of real scalar field theory on causal sets, the intimate relation of the Sorkin-Johnston vacuum to entropic purity is elucidated. It is shown that taking a set of sensible principles, and the most natural assumption on the space of fields, leaves the Sorkin-Johnston state as the only candidate for the global vacuum of a quasifree theory.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) explains how generic quantum many-body systems thermalize internally. It implies that local operators' time-averaged expectation values approximately equal their thermal expectation values, regardless of microscopic details. The ETH's range of applicability therefore impacts theory and experiments. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ recently showed that non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH. Such symmetries have excited interest in quantum thermodynamics lately, as they are equivalent to conserved quantities that fail to commute with each other and noncommutation is a quintessentially quantum phenomenon. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ proposed a non-Abelian ETH, which we support numerically. The numerics model a one-dimensional (1D) next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain of up to 18 qubits. We represent local operators with matrices relative to an energy eigenbasis. The matrices bear out seven predictions of the non-Abelian ETH. We also prove analytically that the non-Abelian ETH exhibits a self-consistency property. The proof relies on a thermodynamic-entropy definition different from that in Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ This work initiates the observation and application of the non-Abelian ETH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group field theory is a background-independent approach to quantum gravity whose starting point is the definition of a quantum field theory on an auxiliary group manifold (not interpreted as spacetime). Group field theory models can be seen as an extension of matrix and tensor models by additional data, and are traditionally defined through a functional integral whose perturbative expansion generates a sum over discrete geometries. More recently, some efforts have been directed towards formulations of group field theory based on a Hilbert space and operators, in particular in applications to cosmology. This is an attempt to review some of these formulations and their main ideas, to disentangle these constructions as much as possible from applications and phenomenology, and to put them into a wider context of quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance Breaking in Gravity and Cosmological Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breaking diffeomorphism invariance has been motivated in the literature on several grounds, including the emergence of General Relativity (GR). For this to be a reliable possibility, in a theory with minor violations of general covariance, a healthy behavior is required that is only slightly different from that of GR. In this paper, the cosmological evolution of the scale factor in gravity with broken general covariance is investigated in the (modified) Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. The model augments the GR Lagrangian with all of the symmetry-breaking terms in the leading order, the terms involving two derivatives. The magnitudes of (minor) violations are kept general modulo the condition for a healthy linearized version of the model. The analytic solutions of the scale factor in the full non-linear theory for the single-component universes are attempted; the radiation and vacuum solutions are found analytically, whereas the matter solution is worked out numerically since there does not exist an analytic solution in the required form. It is observed that the solutions smoothly connect to those of GR in the limit of vanishing symmetry-breaking. The more realistic, two-component, and three-component universes are numerically studied, and no sign of unhealthy behavior is observed: minor diffeomorphism violating modifications to GR do not cause instabilities in the evolution of the scale factor.</description>

Abstract: A lattice implementation of the recently introduced center-symmetric Landau gauge is discussed and its predictions confronted with numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the link average and the link correlators computed in that gauge are order parameters of the confinement-deconfinement transition at nonzero temperature. Strictly speaking, this requires a specific treatment of the Gribov copies that we discuss in detail. The numerical simulations comply with the theoretical predictions for the link average computed below and above the deconfinement temperature. Our results show that, within appropriately chosen gauges, one can construct local order parameters for center symmetry, as proxies for the non-local Polyakov loop.</description>

Abstract: We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, i.e. $g_{00} \ne -1/g_{11}$, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In this paper, we show, in Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $r = 0$, and the energy conditions are predominately violated indicating a repulsive gravitational core. In addition, we show that the line element admits a wormhole solution which is not traversable, and the black hole at its vanishing horizon radius could be interpreted as a remnant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to Quantum Mechanics that we call Curved Quantum Mechanics. We introduce an infinite-dimensional K\"ahler manifold ${\cal M}$, that we call the state manifold, such that the cotangent space $T_z^*{\cal M}$ is a Hilbert space. In this approach, a state of a quantum system is described by a point in the cotangent bundle $T^*{\cal M}$, that is, by a point $z\in{\cal M}$ in the state manifold and a one-form $\psi\in T^*_z{\cal M}$. The quantum dynamics is described by an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system on the state manifold with a magnetic field $H$, which reduces to the Schr\"odinger equation for zero curvature and reduces to the equations of geodesics for zero magnetic field. The curvature of the state manifold is determined by gravity, that is, by the mass/energy of the system, so that for microscopic systems the manifold is flat and for macroscopic systems it is strongly curved, which prohibits Schr\"odinger cat type states. We solved the dynamical equations exactly for the complex projective space and the complex hyperbolic space and show that in the case of negative curvature there is a bifurcation at a critical value of the curvature. This means that for small mass all modes are in the quantum regime with the unitary periodic dynamics and for large mass there are classical modes, with not a periodic but rather an exponential time evolution leading to a collapse of the state vector.</description>

Abstract: The open dynamics of quantum particles in relativistic scattering is investigated. In particular, we consider the scattering process of quantum particles coupled to an environment initially in a vacuum state. Tracing out the environment and using the unitarity of S-operator, we find the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator describing the evolution of the particles. The GKSL generator is exemplified by focusing on the concrete processes: one is the decay of scalar particle ($\phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$), and the others are the pair annihilation and the $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering of scalar particles ($\phi \phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ and $\phi \phi \rightarrow \phi \phi$). The GKSL generator for $\phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ has a parameter with the coupling between $\phi$ and $\chi$ and the mass of both fields. The GKSL generator associated with $\phi \phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ is characterized by a Lorentz-invariant function of initial momenta. Especially, in the pair annihilation process, we show that the probability of pair annihilation varies depending on the superposition state of incident scalar $\phi$ particles. Furthermore, we observe that the GKSL generators derived in this paper have Poincar\'e symmetry. This means that the description by the GKSL generator with Poincar\'e symmetry is effective for the asymptotic behavior of open quantum dynamics in the long-term processes of interest.</description>

      <title>The Vanishing of the Non-linear Static Love Number of Kerr Black Holes and the Role of Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal response of Kerr black holes in four-dimensional space-times subjected to external gravitational fields. Using the Ernst formalism and Weyl coordinates, we analyze the non-linear tidal deformation of rotating black holes and demonstrate that their static tidal Love numbers vanish at all orders of the external tidal field. We also show that this result is intimately related to the presence of underlying non-linear symmetries. Our analysis generalizes previous findings for Schwarzschild black holes and confirms the robustness of four-dimensional black holes against tidal forces.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores gravitational phenomena associated with a non-commutative black hole. Geodesic equations are derived, and a thin accretion disk is analyzed to model the black hole shadow image, considering an optically thin, radiating, and infalling gas. Retrolensing effects are examined to trace photon emission configurations, while gravitational lensing is investigated through weak and strong deflection limits, with lensing equations and observables applied to Sagittarius A*. The study also includes calculations of time delay, energy deposition rate from neutrino annihilation, phase and probability of neutrino oscillation, and neutrino gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>Simplex tensor network renormalization group for boundary theory of 3+1D symTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the construction in arXiv:2210.12127, we develop a symmetry-preserving renormalization group (RG) flow for 3D symmetric theories. These theories are expressed as boundary conditions of a symTFT, which in our case is a 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten topological theory in the bulk. The boundary is geometrically organized into tetrahedra and represented as a tensor network, which we refer to as the "simplex tensor network" state. Each simplex tensor is assigned indices corresponding to its vertices, edges, and faces. We propose a numerical algorithm to implement RG flows for these boundary conditions, and explicitly demonstrate its application to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric theory. By linearly interpolating between three topological fixed-point boundaries, we map the phase transitions characterized by local and non-local order parameters, which respectively detects the breaking of a 0-form and a 2-form symmetry. This formalism is readily extendable to other discrete symmetry groups and, in principle, can be generalized to describe 3D symmetric topological orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling $\xi = 1/2$. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the semiclassical system is quasi-linear hyperbolic and, within this class, provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassical gravity without spacetime symmetries. These two-point functions yield stress-energy expectation values proportional to the spacetime metric (modulo ambiguities). If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Invariant Stability Conditions on Certain Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply results on inducing stability conditions to local Calabi-Yau threefolds and obtain applications to Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory. A basic example is the total space of the canonical bundle of $Z=\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$. We use a result of Dell to construct stability conditions on the derived category of $X$ for which all stable objects can be explicitly described. We relate them to stability conditions on the resolved conifold $Y=\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)^{\oplus 2}$ in two ways: geometrically via the McKay correspondence, and algebraically via a quotienting operation on quivers with potential. These stability conditions were first discussed in the physics literature by Closset and del Zotto, and were constructed mathematically by Xiong by a different method. We obtain a complete description of the corresponding DT invariants, from which we can conclude that they define analytic wall-crossing structures in the sense of Kontsevich and Soibelman. In the last section we discuss several other examples of a similar flavour.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric SYK model with a curious low energy behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $\mathcal{N}$ = 2, 4 supersymmetric SYK models that have a peculiar low energy behavior, with the entropy going like $S = S_{0} + \text{(constant)}T^{a}$, where $a \neq 1$. The large $N$ equations for these models are a generalization of equations that have been previously studied as an unjustified truncation of the planar diagrams describing the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics or other related matrix models. Here we reanalyze these equations in order to better understand the low energy physics of these models. We find that the scalar fields develop large expectation values which explore the low energy valleys in the potential. The low energy physics is dominated by quadratic fluctuations around these values. These models were previously conjectured to have a spin glass phase. We did not find any evidence for this phase by using the usual diagnostics, such as searching for replica symmetry breaking solutions.</description>

Abstract: Quiver theories constitute an important class of supersymmetric gauge theories with well-defined holographic duals. Motivated by holographic duality, we use localisation on $S^d$ to study long linear quivers at large-N. The large-N solution shows a remarkable degree of universality across dimensions, including $d = 4$ where quivers are genuinely superconformal. In that case we upgrade the solution of long quivers to quivers of any length.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of symmetry descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many cases the symmetry structure of quantum field theories can be neatly encoded into their associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), a topological field theory in one dimension higher. For geometrically engineered QFTs in string theory this SymTFT has been argued to arise from the background geometry, essentially by integration of the topological sector of string theory on the horizon of the geometry transverse to the QFT locus. In this paper we clarify some subtle aspects of this proposal. We take a higher dimensional approach, where the ten dimensional string theory fields to be integrated arise as edge modes of a topological field theory in eleven dimensions. The resulting construction provides a SymTFT generalisation of the descent procedure for anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geodesics in general relativity describe the behaviour of test particles in a gravitational field. In 5D Kaluza-Klein, geodesics reproduce the Lorentz force motion of particles in an electromagnetic field. This paper studies geodesic motion on a higher-dimensional $M_4 \times K$ with background metrics encoding general 4D gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars. It shows that the classical mass and charge of a test particle become variable quantities when the geodesic traverses regions of spacetime with massive gauge fields, such as the weak force field, or with non-constant Higgs scalars. This agrees with the physical fact that interactions mediated by massive bosons can change the mass and charge of particles. The variation rates of mass and charge along a geodesic are given by natural geometric formulae. In regions where mass is preserved, there are additional constants of motion, one for every abelian or simple summand in the Killing algebra of $K$. The last part of the paper discusses traditional difficulties of Kaluza-Klein models, such as the low $q / m$ ratios in the 5D model. It suggests possible ways to circumvent them. It also remarks the naturalness of a model in which elementary particles always travel at the speed of light in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within the framework of Horndeski gravity. The investigation is motivated by the need to understand the emission of information from black holes, as encoded by quantum complexity, which persists even at zero temperature. Traditionally, black holes are considered to cease emitting information upon reaching zero temperature, yet our findings suggest a minimum level of information or minimal entropy. This challenges the classical notion of black hole death. Recent studies in the context of Horndeski gravity and the AdS/BCFT correspondence have identified a non-zero minimal entropy at zero temperature. Our work shows that complexity and entropy provide crucial insights into the information emission from black holes, extending beyond their classical death. These findings significantly affect our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases. The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the computation of the string partition function in AdS$_3$ focussing on the appearance of spacetime (super) symmetries. We show how the asymptotic symmetries of the AdS$_3$ spacetime, which generate the boundary (super) Virasoro currents, are captured by the one-loop partition sum. We use this to argue that the recent understanding of near-extremal black hole thermodynamics based on the gravitational path integral continues to hold for finite string length. Along the way we clarify some aspects of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality and, in particular, deduce which bulk gauge fields lead to boundary currents. We also explain how one can interpolate between supersymmetric and thermal (Atick-Witten) fermion boundary conditions in the target space by suitably tuning rotational chemical potentials in the string partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a tool to study string perturbation theory of the Klebanov-Strassler solution in the large radius approximation based on open-closed superstring field theory. Combining the large radius expansion and a double scaling limit, we find a perturbative background solution of open-closed superstring field theory that corresponds to the Klebanov-Strassler solution. To illustrate the utilities of this approach, we break supersymmetry of the background by placing a stack of anti-D3-branes at the tip of the throat. We then find a perturbative open string background solution to the third order in the large radius approximation, which agrees with the well-known supergravity analysis of Kachru-Pearson-Verlinde (KPV) on the stability of the antiD3-brane supersymmetry breaking. The perturbative background solution to the open string field theory we found is expected to be dual to an NS5-brane probing the KS solution.</description>

      <title>On the stability of holographic confinement with magnetic fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the stability properties of a very simple holographic model for a confining field theory. The gravity dual consists of an Abelian gauge field, with non-trivial magnetic flux, coupled to six-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. We construct a one-parameter family of regular solitonic solutions, where the gauge field carries flux along a compact circle that smoothly shrinks at a finite value of the holographic direction, introducing a confinement scale in the dual effective four-dimensional field theory. The free energy of these solitonic backgrounds is compared to that of domain-wall solutions representing a five-dimensional conformal field theory. This reveals a zero-temperature first-order phase transition in the dual field theory, separating confining and conformal phases.
  We compute the spectrum of bound states by analysing field fluctuations in the gravity background, after dimensional reduction on the circle. The lightest states are a scalar and a vector particle. A tachyonic instability emerges near a turning point in the free energy, where its concavity changes. The phase transition prevents the realisation of this instability. Within the stable portion of parameter space, all bound states, including the lightest scalar, have masses comparable to other dynamical scales. Near the phase transition and beyond, in metastable and unstable regions, we find deviations in the mass of the lightest scalar, suggesting it couples to the trace of the stress-energy tensor in the field theory, consistently with its interpretation as an approximate dilaton.</description>

      <title>Size and Shape of Rotating Strings and the Correspondence to Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of the correspondence between black holes and fundamental strings with non-zero spin, we compute the sizes of rotating strings for small, moderate, and large values of the angular momentum and compare them to the sizes of rotating black holes. We argue that the ratio of the size perpendicular to the rotation plane to the size along the rotation plane is an approximate adiabatic invariant and can therefore be meaningfully compared for objects on different sides of the correspondence point. We show that the spin-dependence of this ratio for small angular momenta agrees for black holes and strings. When the spin is large, the ratios for these objects exhibit different behavior, but this is expected since for large angular momenta there is no direct correspondence between black holes and single-string states. We also develop a random-walk model that describes highly excited strings and accurately reproduces the sizes of rotating strings for all values of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Supersymmetry via the Dressing Field Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional supersymmetry is a proposal, introduced by Alvarez-Valenzuela-Zanelli (AVZ), aiming to use the framework of supersymmetric field theory to describe fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields in a unified way, as both parts of a single superconnection. It hinges upon the so-called matter ansatz. Unfortunately, the formal and conceptual status of the ansatz remained unclear, preventing unconventional supersymmetry to be used in a principled way as a general approach beyond the model in which it was first considered. In this letter, we lift this restriction by showing that the ansatz is a special case of the Dressing Field Method, a new systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical edge modes in Maxwell theory from a BRST perspective, with an application to the Casimir energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, dynamical edge modes (DEM) in Maxwell theory have been constructed using a specific local boundary condition on the horizon. We discuss how to enforce this boundary condition on an infinite parallel plate in the QED vacuum by introducing Lagrange multiplier fields into the action. We carefully introduce appropriate boundary ghosts to maintain BRST invariance. Explicit correspondence of this BRST extended theory with the original DEM formulation is discussed, both directly, and through the correspondence between edge modes and Wilson lines attached to the boundary surface. We then use functional methods to calculate the Casimir energy for the first time with DEM boundary conditions imposed on two infinite parallel plates, both in generalized Coulomb and linear covariant gauge. Depending on the gauge, different fields are contributing, but, after correctly implementing the BRST symmetry, we retrieve the exact same Casimir energy as for two perfectly conducting parallel plates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in this minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms coming from the Standard Model fields and the fields of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with sufficient $e$-foldings.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Teleportation versus Information Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is the phenomenon in which locally inaccessible energy is activated as extractable work through collaborative local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with an entangled partner. It closely resembles the more well-known quantum information teleportation (QIT) where quantum information can be sent through an entangled pair with LOCC. It is tempting to ask how QET is related to QIT. Here we report a first study of this connection. Despite the apparent similarity, we show that these two phenomena are not only distinct but moreover are mutually competitive. We show a perturbative trade-off relation between their performance in a thermal entangled chaotic many-body system, in which both QET and QIT are simultaneously implemented through a traversable wormhole in an emergent spacetime. Motivated by this example, we study a generic setup of two entangled qudits and prove a universal non-perturbative trade-off bound. It shows that for any teleportation protocol, the overall performance of QET and QIT together is constrained by the entanglement resource. We discuss some explanations of our results.</description>

      <title>Revising the full one-loop gauge prefactor in electroweak vacuum stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum in the Standard Model with the full one-loop prefactor. We focus on the gauge degrees of freedom and derive the degeneracy factors appearing in the functional determinant using group theoretical arguments. Our treatment shows that the transverse modes were previously overcounted, so we revise the calculation of that part of the prefactor. The new result modifies the gauge fields' contribution by $6\%$ and slightly decreases the previously predicted lifetime of the electroweak vacuum, which remains much longer than the age of the universe. Our discussion of the transverse mode degeneracy applies to any calculation of functional determinants involving gauge fields in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fractal Subsystem Symmetries, Anomalies, Boundaries, and Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work reports an extensive study of three-dimensional topological ordered phases that, in one of the directions behave like usual topological order concerning mobility of excitations, but in the perpendicular plane manifest type-II fracton physics dictated by a fractal subsystem symmetry. We obtain an expression for the ground state degeneracy, which depends intricately on the sizes of the plane, signaling a strong manifestation of ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The ground state degeneracy can be interpreted in terms of spontaneous/explicit breaking of fractal subsystem symmetries. We also study the boundary physics, which in turn is useful to understand the connection with certain two-dimensional phases. Finally, we derive a low-energy but not long-distance effective field theory, by Higgsing a fractal $U(1)$ symmetry and taking the deep IR limit. This description embodies in a natural way several aspects of the phases, such as the content of generalized global symmetries, the role of fractal symmetries on the mobility of excitations, the anomalies, and the boundary physics.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We nonparametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our nonparametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/nonmonotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the complete four-loop perturbative renormalization of a low-temperature statistical mechanics model of flat polymerized membranes. Using a non-local effective flexural theory, which is based on transverse elastic fluctuations, we analytically determine the anomalous elasticity critical exponent $\eta$, which controls all scaling behaviors in the theory, at the four existing fixed points. The results are obtained as apparently convergent series, allowing for precise estimates without resummations. We independently verify and supplement the results of recent four-loop work [Pikelner 2022 EPL 138 17002] derived from a different model. Additionally, we find good agreement with non-perturbative theoretical approaches and experimental results on soft materials and graphene.</description>

      <title>Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our paper introduces a new theoretical framework called the Fractional Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has important physical implications. Using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action integral, we derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein--Gordon equation. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with exponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and a logarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters, $m$ and $\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\mu$. By employing linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and analyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss--Bonnet couplings. The scaling behavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in the coupling to the Gauss--Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark sector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, supermassive Black Hole Shadows, and strong gravitational lensing, we estimated the values of $m$ and $\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution is consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values $\alpha_0=1.38\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\pm 0.05$, and $\mu=1.48 \pm 0.17$ (consistent with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we obtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most recent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic acceleration other than $\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize and significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting the practical implications of fractional calculus in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>
