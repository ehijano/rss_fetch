      <title>Control of localized states of itinerant electrons and their magnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the magnetic properties of nanosystems by an electric field offers a number of advantages for spintronics applications. Using the noncollinear Alexander-Anderson model, we have shown that the interaction of localized magnetic moments formed by itinerant electrons strongly depends on the position of the d-level relative to the Fermi level, which determines the number of localized electrons. Depending on this parameter, the ground state of the magnetic dimer can be ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or noncollinear without the effects of spin-orbit interaction. The magnetic state can be controlled by shifting the d-level with an electric field, even without current flow. For a sufficiently large value of the hopping parameter between localized states there can be several self-consistent solutions with different values of magnetic moments. This opens new possibilities for manipulation of the magnetic structure of nanosystems. The results obtained lead to a new interpretation of the mechanisms of magnetization reversal, recording, and deleting of magnetic structures in tunneling spectroscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Perturbation Theory (NNPT): Learning Residual Corrections from Exact Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex physical systems admit natural decomposition into an exactly solvable component and a perturbative correction. Rather than training neural networks to learn complete trajectories from scratch, we introduce Neural Network Perturbation Theory (NNPT), where networks predict only residual perturbations after analytically subtracting known exact solutions.
  We validate this framework through systematic comparison: using identical 2x32 architectures, correction learning achieves 28-54x lower validation error compared to networks trained on complete trajectories. Using the gravitational three-body problem as a test bed, we investigate capacity transitions in fixed-architecture multilayer perceptrons as Jovian mass varies from 0.05 to 30 times its physical value. An equalized-accuracy protocol reveals that both minimal network capacity and training time exhibit sharp transitions at f_c = 15.6+-1.0, where the system enters a strongly chaotic regime. At this transition, minimal capacity jumps approximately sevenfold from ~1,200 to ~8,600 parameters (architectures 2x32 and 3x64).
  Preliminary exploration of sequential two-stage corrections suggests that first-stage networks already capture dominant perturbative features. Our symplectic integrator maintains relative energy conservation below 2x10^-7 throughout, confirming that transitions reflect physical complexity rather than numerical error. Our results establish correction learning as a general strategy for parameter-efficient surrogates and demonstrate that physical complexity imposes fundamental capacity barriers on fixed-architecture networks at chaos onset.</description>

      <title>Comparison of shock compaction models for granular materials: P -{\alpha} model and mesoscale simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines particle velocity measurements in granular sugar to evaluate the predictive accuracy of two computational models for weak shock under flyer-plate impact: the continuum-based P-alpha Menko model and mesoscale simulations with explicit particle and pore representations. Using flyer-plate impact experiments as a benchmark, we show that both two-dimensional (2D) models can reproduce the measured particle velocity histories, but through fundamentally different mechanisms. In the P-alpha framework, applying a pressure-dependent yield strength is essential to capture the particle velocity evolution, though calibration of other constitutive parameters, such as crush-out pressure, still strongly influences the response. In contrast, mesoscale simulations are less sensitive to parameter tuning and rely critically on the physical state variable of porosity, represented in 2D as an equivalent measure of the 3D specimen. Together, these results establish that their mechanical interpretations differ: continuum parameters act as effective surrogates for grain-scale physics, whereas mesoscale modeling reveals porosity as the dominant control of macroscopic wave onset.</description>

      <title>Distortion-Driven Carrier Decoupling in Doped LiMgPO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Cross-Geometry Transfer Learning in Fast Electromagnetic Shower Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate particle shower simulation remains a critical computational bottleneck for high-energy physics. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as Geant4, are computationally prohibitive, while existing machine learning surrogates are tied to specific detector geometries and require complete retraining for each design change or alternative detector. We present a transfer learning framework for generative calorimeter simulation models that enables adaptation across diverse geometries with high data efficiency. Using point cloud representations and pre-training on the International Large Detector detector, our approach handles new configurations without re-voxelizing showers for each geometry. On the CaloChallenge dataset, transfer learning with only 100 target-domain samples achieves a $44\%$ improvement on the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance over training from scratch. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation achieves competitive performance while updating only $17\%$ of model parameters. Our analysis provides insight into adaptation mechanisms for particle shower development, establishing a baseline for future progress of point cloud approaches in calorimeter simulation.</description>

      <title>Electric Polarization from Nonpolar Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Born effective charge (BEC), a fundamental quantity in lattice dynamics and ferroelectric theory, provides a quantitative measure of linear polarization response to ionic displacements. However, it does not account for higher-order effects, which can play a significant role in certain materials, such as fluorite HfO$_2$. In this letter, we extend the BEC framework by introducing the concept of second-order dynamical charge and mode effective charge. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that specific combinations of nonpolar phonon modes in many oxides can induce substantial second-order polarizations, reaching magnitudes comparable to those of intrinsically polar modes. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the charge density, we elucidate the microscopic origin of these effects, tracing them to variations in bond covalency and local electronic rearrangements. We also demonstrate large second-order mode effective charge in well-studied perovskites such as SrTiO$_3$, highlighting the generality of these phenomena. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that drives polarization in crystalline solids, offering new insights into the design principles of next-generation ferroelectric, piezoelectric and multifunctional materials.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics of Fermi--Hubbard systems using the Gaussian phase-space representation with diffusion gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Gaussian Phase-Space Representation to solve the real-time dynamic of interacting fermions in 1D, 2D, and 3D systems. The method is exact up to a spiking point, which represents a limit on the practical simulation time. The spiking can be delayed, and the practical simulation time extended, by adjusting the gauges of the representation, resulting in different equivalent stochastic differential equations. Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F. Rousse \textit{et al.} 2024, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{57}, 015303], the new method achieves a significantly longer practical simulation time and can be applied to significantly larger systems.</description>

      <title>Chain of Unit-Physics: A Primitive-Centric Approach to Scientific Code Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.</description>

      <title>A simulation approach including under-resolved scales for multi-component fluid flows in multi-scale porous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop computational models and methodology for accurate multi-component-flow simulation in under-resolved multi-scale porous structures. It is generally impractical to fully resolve the flow in porous structures with large length-scale difference due to tremendously high computational expense. The flow contributions from under-resolved scales need to be accounted for with proper physics modeling as well as simulation processes. Using pre-computed physical properties such as the absolute permeability, K0, the capillary-pressure-saturation curve, and the relative permeability, Kr, in typically resolved porous structures, local fluid force is conjectured and applied to simulation in the under-resolved regions that are represented by porous media. By doing so, accurate simulation of flow in multi-scale porous structures becomes feasible.
  In order to check the accuracy and robustness of this method, a set of benchmark test cases are performed for both single-component and multi-component flows in artificially constructed multi-scale porous structures, and simulation results are compared with analytic solutions and/or results with much finer resolution resolving the porous structures. Quantitatively consistent results are obtained with proper input of K0, capillary pressure, and Kr in all tested cases.
  Specifically, imbibition patterns, entry pressure, residual component patterns, and the absolute and relative permeability are accurately captured with this approach.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann models for the hydrodynamic equations in multiphase flow with high density ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase flows with high density ratios, such as water and air flows, have recently been simulated using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. This approach corresponds to solving the phase field equations, such as the Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations, and the hydrodynamic equations, typically the Navier-Stokes and pressure equations for pseudo-incompressible fluids. Due to the high density ratio, the higher-order numerical truncation errors associated with spatial density gradients can become significant. These errors can lead to problems such as inaccuracies in shear stress, violations of Galilean invariance, and undesirable dependencies on absolute pressure for the pseudo-incompressible solutions. To overcome such problems, the moments of the distribution function and the equilibrium state must be carefully designed while ensuring robustness. In this work, we propose a new scheme based on the lattice kinetic scheme (LKS), which directly solves the velocity and pressure fields in the similar discrete space as the LB method. When mapping the LKS-based models to the LB models, the original LKS models are simplified for computational efficiency and the filter collision operator is implemented. Benchmark test cases confirm that the proposed scheme effectively addresses these issues, achieving high accuracy and robustness while eliminating the iterative steps typically required in the LKS. One of the most significant improvements is the accuracy of the airflow field induced by water motion, likely due to improved momentum transfer across the interface.</description>

      <title>Capillary flow simulation with the phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) model has been developed to perform high fidelity multiphase flow simulations. Its ability to accurately handle high density ratio and surface tension effects is expected to be beneficial for capillary flow simulation, leading to accurate reproduction of flow patterns such as slug flow, droplet flow, and film flow. This is critical in many engineering cases because the flow patterns significantly affect the velocity and pressure fields. In this study, on top of the LB models based on the conservative Allen-Cahn equation and the volumetric boundary conditions for the complex geometries, an optimized wettability and friction model are implemented. With these models, we conducted a set of benchmark test cases, including static and dynamic multiphase flow scenarios such as the droplet on the curved surfaces, water-filling channel for the Lucas-Washburn law, and the critical pressure in the three-dimensional channel, an air-driven multiphase flow in the experiments. In all of these cases, the solver produces results that are consistent with both theory and experiment, even with respect to the pressure field accuracy, which has often been overlooked in many previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles DFT calculations on the hydrides Ca2NiH6, Sr2NiH6, and Ba2NiH6 reveal key thermodynamic properties. These compounds exhibit increasing entropy and heat capacity with temperature, and are thermodynamically stable at elevated temperatures due to negative free energies. The kinetics of hydrogen storage is influenced by entropy changes during hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Optically, Ba2NiH6 shows a high refractive index at low energies. Mechanical assessments indicate Sr2NiH6 is incompressible with moderate malleability, Ca2NiH6 has the highest resistance to deformation, while Ba2NiH6 is most compressible. Formation energies and hydrogen storage capacities (4.005 wt% for Ca2NiH6, 2.548 wt% for Sr2NiH6, and 1.750 wt% for Ba2NiH6) highlight Ca2NiH6 as the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage technology.</description>

      <title>GPU-native Embedding of Complex Geometries in Adaptive Octree Grids Applied to the Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) reduces computational costs in CFD by concentrating resolution where needed, but efficiently embedding complex, non-aligned geometries on GPUs remains challenging. We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\text{Re}\in\{10, 15, 20\}$). Results demonstrate that geometry handling and interpolation impose modest overhead while delivering accurate force predictions and stable near-wall resolution on adaptive Cartesian grids. The approach is general and applicable to other explicit solvers requiring GPU-resident geometry embedding.</description>

Abstract: The ability to switch and program molecular transitions via deterministically located plasmonic nanoantennae presents opportunities for wide spectrum of applications from biosensors to quantum computing. Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.</description>

      <title>On the importance of numerical integration details for homogeneous flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sllod equations of motion enable modeling of homogeneous flow at the atomic scale, and are commonly used to predict fluid properties such as viscosity. However, few publicly available codes support such simulations, and those that do often do not implement a reversible numerical integration scheme or have other subtle problems. Here, we demonstrate a reversible and energy-conserving integration scheme for the Sllod equations of motion with error on the order of $\delta t^3$, in line with typical operator splitting integrators used in standard molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss various implementation details, and implement the scheme in LAMMPS where we find that our changes enable more accurate simulation of transient responses, mixed flows, and steady states, especially at high rates of flow. Importantly, we show that a lack of energy conservation can manifest as a systematic error in the direct ensemble average of the pressure tensor, leading to an error in the calculated viscosity which becomes significant at high flow rates.</description>

      <title>A high-order weighted positive and flux conservative method for the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-order conservative, positivity-preserving, and non-oscillatory scheme for solving the Vlasov equation. The scheme attains formal fifth-order accuracy through a convex combination of positive and non-oscillatory polynomials in substencils. Nonlinear weights for these polynomials are formulated that assign higher priority to substencils with larger L2 norm to enhance resolution while maintaining positivity and non-oscillatory properties. An approximate dispersion relation indicates that the spectral properties of the present scheme outperform those of an underlying fifth-order scheme and even surpass those of a seventh-order scheme in certain wavenumber ranges. We apply this scheme to the one-dimensional Vlasov-Ampere equations and the two-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and demonstrate high-resolution simulations with improved conservation of entropy.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Thermal Properties of Cu-Au Janus Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the thermal and structural properties of Cu-Au (Copper-Gold) Janus nanoparticles with a diameter of 5 nm are investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within the interactions defined by the many-body embedded atom model (EAM). A set of nanoparticle models has been constructed, with varying Cu and Au ratios. MD method is carried out to calculate the melting temperature, heat capacity, radial distribution function (RDF), Lindemann index, mean square displacement (MSD), and diffusion coefficients of these models. The findings demonstrate that nanoparticles rich in Cu exhibit a higher melting temperature and more defined phase transitions. In contrast, structures rich in gold exhibited reduced melting temperatures and showed surface-initiated melting behaviours. MD study highlights that the thermal stability and atomic mobility of Cu-Au Janus nanoparticles depend on the composition ratio and the dispersion of materials.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Predicting Permeability Tensors of 2D Porous Media: Comparison of Convolution- and Transformer-based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permeability is a central concept in the macroscopic description of flow through porous media, with applications spanning from oil recovery to hydrology. Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately.</description>

      <title>The Spin-MInt Algorithm: an Accurate and Symplectic Propagator for the Spin-Mapping Representation of Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping methods, including the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) mapping and spin-mapping, are commonly utilised to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics by propagating classical mapping variable trajectories. Recent work confirmed the Momentum Integral (MInt) algorithm is the only known symplectic algorithm for the MMST Hamiltonian. To our knowledge, no symplectic algorithm has been published for the spin-mapping representation without converting to MMST variables and utilising the MInt algorithm. Here, we present the Spin-MInt algorithm which directly propagates the spin-mapping variables. First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Machine Learning Force Field for Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Organic Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of organic liquids is a vital parameter influencing various industrial and environmental applications, including energy conversion, electronics cooling, and chemical processing. However, atomistic simulation of thermal conductivity of organic liquids has been hindered by the limited accuracy of classical force fields and the huge computational demand of ab initio methods. In this work, we present a machine learning force field (MLFF)-based molecular dynamics simulation workflow to predict the thermal conductivity of 20 organic liquids. Here, we introduce the concept of differential attention into the MLFF architecture for enhanced learning ability, and we use density of the liquids to align the MLFF with experiments. As a result, this workflow achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 14% for the thermal conductivity of various organic liquids, significantly lower than that of the current off-the-shelf classical force field (78%). Furthermore, the MLFF is rewritten using Triton language to maximize simulation speed, enabling rapid prediction of thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>First-principles screening of materials with extreme effective masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective mass of charge carriers is a fundamental descriptor of the electronic structure of materials, and can be used to assess performance in electronics applications, or to screen for thermoelectrics and transparent conductors. Here, we perform a high-throughput computational screening of approximately 20,000 experimentally known three-dimensional stoichiometric inorganics obtained from the Materials Cloud 3D structure database. By combining density-functional theory calculations and maximally localized Wannier functions, we are able to compute the full conductivity effective mass tensor for electrons and holes from the Boltzmann transport equation in the constant relaxation-time approximation. This approach captures the effects of band non-parabolicity, anisotropy, and valley multiplicity that would be neglected by standard parabolic fittings. The screening identifies a curated set of candidates exhibiting extreme electronic properties, from ultra-low to ultra-large effective masses, these latter associated with flat-band physics. We validate the workflow by recovering established high-mobility semiconductors and highlight promising novel candidates. Furthermore, we classify materials by their mass anisotropy and discuss the physical limits of defining a conductivity effective mass in narrow-gap regimes at room temperature. The resulting dataset provides a systematic roadmap to search for high-performance materials in novel chemical spaces.</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.</description>

Abstract: Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio M\"ah\"onen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>

Abstract: Jet reconstruction remains a critical task in the analysis of data from HEP colliders. We describe in this paper a new, highly performant, Julia package for jet reconstruction, JetReconstruction.jl, which integrates into the growing ecosystem of Julia packages for HEP. With this package users can run sequential reconstruction algorithms for jets. In particular, for LHC events, the Anti-${k}_\text{T}$, Cambridge/Aachen and Inclusive-${k}_\text{T}$ algorithms can be used. For FCCee studies the use of alternative algorithms such as the Generalised ${k}_\text{T}$ for $e^+e^-$ and Durham are also supported.
  The performance of the core algorithms is better than Fastjet's C++ implementation, for typical LHC and FCCee events, thanks to the Julia compiler's exploitation of single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD), as well as ergonomic compact data layouts.
  The full reconstruction history is made available, allowing inclusive and exclusive jets to be retrieved. The package also provides the means to visualise the reconstruction. Substructure algorithms have been added that allow advanced analysis techniques to be employed. The package can read event data from EDM4hep files and reconstruct jets from these directly, opening the door to FCCee and other future collider studies in Julia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unitary evolution in time may be treated as a curve in the manifold of the special unitary group. The length of such a curve can be related to the energetic cost of the associated computation, meaning a geodesic curve identifies an energetically optimal path. In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.</description>

Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations</title>

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.</description>

      <title>Mapping Microstructure: Manifold Construction for Accelerated Materials Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.</description>

      <title>A stochastic branching particle method for solving non-conservative reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic branching particle-based method for solving nonlinear non-conservative advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The method splits the evolution into an advection-diffusion step, based on a linearized Kolmogorov forward equation and approximated by stochastic particle transport, and a reaction step implemented through a branching birth-death process that provides a consistent temporal discretization of the underlying reaction dynamics. This construction yields a mesh-free, nonnegativity-preserving scheme that naturally accommodates non-conservative systems and remains robust in the presence of singularities or blow-up. We validate the method on two representative two-dimensional systems: the Allen-Cahn equation and the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model. In both cases, the present method accurately captures nonlinear behaviors such as phase separation and aggregation, and achieves reliable performance without the need for adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica Symmetry Breaking and Topological Collapse in Spin Glasses with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Extended Physics Informed Neural Network for Hyperbolic Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, we employ the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux, modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock subdomains, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors, with coupling enforced via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition to ensure physically consistent flux continuity. We compare XPINN with standard PINNs and its variants, including PINN with artificial viscosity, PINN with Welge construction, and PINN with the Oleinik entropy condition, and across all cases, XPINN consistently outperforms the other methods, accurately resolving sharp fronts and capturing the correct physical behavior. Importantly, XPINN achieves this using the simpler Adam optimizer, whereas some PINN variants require more complex or higher-order strategies such as L-BFGS to reach comparable accuracy, demonstrating that XPINN is a robust and scalable approach for challenging hyperbolic PDEs without artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. The code is available at github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.</description>
