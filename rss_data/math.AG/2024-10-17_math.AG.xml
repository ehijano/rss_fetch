      <title>Les Houches lecture notes on moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide an introduction to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, a fundamental concept in the theories of 2D quantum gravity, topological string theory, and matrix models. We begin by reviewing some basic results concerning the recursive boundary structure of the moduli space and the associated cohomology theory. We then present Witten's celebrated conjecture and its generalisation, framing it as a recursive computation of cohomological field theory correlators via topological recursion. We conclude with a discussion of JT gravity in relation to hyperbolic geometry and topological strings. These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)" in Summer 2024.</description>

      <title>Hilbert irreducibility for integral points on punctured linear algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth integral variety $X$ over a number field $K$ and a closed subscheme $Z$ of $X$ of codimension at least $2$, the combined conjectures of Campana and Corvaja-Zannier predict that, up to a finite extension of $K$, there exists a finite set of finite places $S$ of $K$ such that the $S$-integral points on $X\setminus Z$ are not strongly thin. We verify this property for all linear algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>Tropical Split Jacobians of genus 2 and optimal covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore connections between the category of tropical abelian varieties (tav), $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{A}$, and the the category of tropical curves, $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{C}$, first in a broader context and then specifically by studying the phenomenon of tropical split Jacobians. Jacobians of genus $2$ curves are two-dimensional tav and as such more complicated than their one-dimensional cousins. Whenever $\Gamma$, however, is a covering of an elliptic curve, it so happens that $Jac(\Gamma)$ splits into simpler objects, the direct sum of elliptic curves. This relation is pathological in essentially two ways, the splitting of $Jac(\Gamma)$ is not unique, and it is a priori not clear how to compute it. Similar to algebraic geometry, optimal coverings offer a remedy for both: They resolve indeterminacy as they provide us with a canonical choice. They resolve indeterminability as they provide us with an algorithmic approach. Our methods build on theory developed by Len, Mikhalkin, R\"ohrle, Ulirsch, Zakharov, Zharkov and many more. In accordance with this heritage, we want to put forth tropical geometry as a setting in which we can see abstraction at work. This means pairing "abstract machinery" with a constructive/algorithmic approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the limits of canonical series along families of curves degenerating to a nodal curve which is general for its topology, in the weak sense that the branches over nodes on each of its components are in general position. We define a fan structure on the space of edge lengths on the dual graph of the limit curve, and construct a projective variety parametrizing the limits, organized in strata associated to the cones of this fan.</description>

      <title>Algebraic curves with a large cyclic automorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of algebraic curves $\cX$ with numerous automorphisms in relation to their genus $g(\cX)$ is a well-established area in Algebraic Geometry. In 1995, Irokawa and Sasaki \cite{Sasaki} gave a complete classification of curves over $\mathbb{C}$ with an automorphism of order $N \geq 2g(\mathcal{X}) + 1$. Precisely, such curves are either hyperelliptic with $N=2g(\cX)+2$ with $g(\cX)$ even, or are quotients of the Fermat curve of degree $N$ by a cyclic group of order $N$. Such a classification does not hold in positive characteristic $p$, the curve with equation $y^2=x^p-x$ being a well-studied counterexample. This paper successfully classifies curves with a cyclic automorphism group of order $N$ at least $2g(\mathcal{X}) + 1$ in positive characteristic $p \neq 2$, offering the positive characteristic counterpart to the Irokawa-Sasaki result. The possibility of wild ramification in positive characteristic has presented a few challenges to the investigation.</description>

      <title>Tropicalizing binary geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type A cluster configuration space, commonly known as $\mathcal M_{0,n}$, is the very affine part of the binary geometry associated with the associahedron. The tropicalization of $\mathcal M_{0,n}$ can be realized as the space of phylogenetic trees and its signed tropicalizations as the dual-associahedron subfans. We give a concise overview of this construction and propose an extension to type C. The type C cluster configuration space $\mathcal M_{\mathrm C_\ell}$ arises from the binary geometry associated with the cyclohedron. We define a space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees containing many dual-associahedron and dual-cyclohedron subfans. We conjecturally realize the tropicalization of $\mathcal M_{\mathrm C_\ell}$ as the defined space and its signed tropicalizations as the aforementioned subfans.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the ring of Weyl invariant $E_8$ weak Jacobi forms is isomorphic to that of joint covariants of a binary sextic and a binary quartic form. The ring is therefore finitely generated. A minimal basis of generators is obtained from that already known for the ring of covariants.</description>

      <title>Residue polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A level graph is the data of a pair $(G,\pi)$ consisting of a finite graph $G$ and an ordered partition $\pi$ on the set of vertices of $G$. To each level graph on $n$ vertices we associate a polytope in $\mathbb R^n$ called its residue polytope. We show that residue polytopes are compatible with each other in the sense that if $\pi'$ is a coarsening of $\pi$, then the polytope associated to $(G,\pi)$ is a face of the one associated to $(G,\pi')$. Moreover, they form all the faces of the residue polytope of $G$, defined as the polytope associated to the level graph with the trivial ordered partition. The results are used in a companion work to describe limits of spaces of Abelian differentials on families of Riemann surfaces approaching a stable Riemann surface on the boundary of the moduli space.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal bipyramids lead to the smallest flexible embedded polyhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steffen's polyhedron was believed to have the least number of vertices among polyhedra that can flex without self-intersections. Maksimov clarified that the pentagonal bipyramid with one face subdivided into three is the only polyhedron with fewer vertices for which the existence of a self-intersection-free flex was open. Since subdividing a face into three does not change the mobility, we focus on flexible pentagonal bipyramids. When a bipyramid flexes, the distance between the two opposite vertices of the two pyramids changes; associating the position of the bipyramid to this distance yields an algebraic map that determines a nontrivial extension of rational function fields. We classify flexible pentagonal bipyramids with respect to the Galois group of this field extension and provide examples for each class, building on a construction proposed by Nelson. Surprisingly, one of our constructions yields a flexible pentagonal bipyramid that can be extended to an embedded flexible polyhedron with 8 vertices. The latter hence solves the open question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.06589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the moduli spaces of nodal sextic curves. We realize each irreducible component of the GIT space of sextic curves with given number of nodes as an open subspace of type IV arithmetic quotients. We then focus on the compactifications of the moduli spaces, one side is the geometric (GIT) compactifications, the other side is the Hodge theoretic compactifications such as Looijenga compactifications and Baily--Borel compactifications. The main result is the isomorphism between GIT and Looijenga compactifications. Some examples are closely related to del Pezzo surfaces. We also extend our results to moduli of nodal sextic curves with specified symmetry.</description>

Abstract: For an abelian variety $A$ over a finitely generated field $K$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$, we prove that the algebraic rank of $A$ is at most a suitably defined analytic rank. Moreover, we prove that equality, i.e., the BSD rank conjecture, holds for $A/K$ if and only if a suitably defined Tate--Shafarevich group of $A/K$ (1) has finite $\ell$-primary component for some/all $\ell \neq p$, or (2) finite prime-to-$p$ part, or (3) has $p$-primary part of finite exponent, or (4) is of finite exponent. There is an algorithm to verify those conditions for concretely given $A/K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spin Gromov-Witten (GW) theory of $\mathbb{P}^1$. Using the standard torus action on $\mathbb{P}^1$, we prove that the associated equivariant potential can be expressed by means of operator formalism and satisfies the 2-BKP hierarchy. As a consequence of this result, we prove the spin analogue of the GW/Hurwitz correspondence of Okounkov-Pandharipande for $\mathbb{P}^1$, which was conjectured by J. Lee. Finally, we prove that this correspondence for a general target spin curve follows from a conjectural degeneration formula for spin GW invariants that holds in virtual dimension 0.</description>

      <title>Theory of weights for log convergent cohomologies II: the case of a proper SNCL scheme in characteristic $p&gt;0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a flat $p$-adic formal family $S$ of log points over a complete discrete valuation ring with perfect residue field of mixed characteristics $(0,p)$ and for a simple normal crossing log scheme $X$ over an exact closed log subscheme of $S$ defined by an element of the maximal ideal of the dvr, we construct two fundamental filtered complexes in the convergent topos the underlying scheme of $X$ over the underlying scheme of $S$. We prove that they are canonically isomorphisc. Because one of the complex is shown to calculate the log convergent cohomology sheaf of $X/S$, the filtered complex produces the weight filtration on the log convergent cohomology sheaf if the underlying scheme of $X$ is proper over the underlying scheme of $S$. We give a comparison theorem between the projection of the filtered complex in the Zariski topos of the underlying scheme of $X$ and the isozariskian weight-filtered complex constructed in the author's previous work.</description>

      <title>Relative Stone-Weierstrass theorem for mappings between varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of real algebraic varieties characterised by a simple rationality condition, which exhibit strong properties regarding approximation of continuous and smooth mappings by regular ones. They form a natural counterpart to the classes of malleable and quasi-malleable varieties. The approximation property studied here is stronger than those considered before and allows us to deduce non-trivial facts about extensions of regular mappings between varieties.</description>

      <title>Newton polyhedra and the integral closure of ideals on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend Saia's results on the characterization of Newton non-degenerate ideals to the context of ideals in $O_{X(S)}$, where $X(S)$ is an affine toric variety defined by the semigroup $S\subset \mathbb{Z}^{n}_{+}$. We explore the relationship between the integral closure of ideals and the Newton polyhedron. We introduce and characterize non-degenerate ideals, showing that their integral closure is generated by specific monomials related to the Newton polyhedron.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the automorphism group of an affine, cubic surface with equation $xyz=g(x,y)$ contains ${\mathbb Z}$ as a finite index subgroup. These equations were first studied by Mordell. v.2: small changes, references updated.</description>

      <title>On a canonical polynomial for links of elliptic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical polynomial is an important output of the multivariable topological Poincar\'e series associated with a normal surface singularity. It can be considered as a multivariable polynomial generalization of the Seiberg--Witten invariant of the link. In the case of elliptic germs, another key topological invariant was considered, the elliptic sequence, which mirrors the specific structure of the elliptic germs and guides several properties of them.
  In this note we study the relationship of these two objects. First of all, we describe the structure of the exponents of the canonical polynomial and prove that they determine the elliptic sequence. For the converse problem, we consider an inductive setup of elliptic germs via natural extension of their graphs and compare the corresponding sets of exponents. This leads to the definition of a good extension which can be characterized by an inclusion type formula for the corresponding canonical polynomials. This reflects in a compatible way the `flag structure' of the elliptic sequence.</description>

      <title>A geometric realization of the chromatic symmetric function of a unit interval graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shareshian-Wachs, Brosnan-Chow, and Guay-Pacquet [Adv. Math. ${\bf 295}$ (2016), ${\bf 329}$ (2018), arXiv:1601.05498] realized the chromatic (quasi-)symmetric function of a unit interval graph in terms of Hessenberg varieties. Here we exhibit another realization of these chromatic (quasi-)symmetric functions in terms of the Betti cohomology of the variety $\mathscr X_\Psi$ defined in [arXiv:2301.00862]. This yields a new inductive combinatorial expression of these chromatic symmetric functions. Based on this, we propose a geometric refinement of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture, whose validity would imply the Shareshian-Wachs conjecture.</description>
