      <title>Measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters using convolutional neural networks with 9.3 years of data in IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DeepCore sub-detector of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory provides access to neutrinos with energies above approximately 5 GeV. Data taken between 2012-2021 (3,387 days) are utilized for an atmospheric $\nu_\mu$ disappearance analysis that studied 150,257 neutrino-candidate events with reconstructed energies between 5-100 GeV. An advanced reconstruction based on a convolutional neural network is applied, providing increased signal efficiency and background suppression, resulting in a measurement with both significantly increased statistics compared to previous DeepCore oscillation results and high neutrino purity. For the normal neutrino mass ordering, the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters and their 1$\sigma$ errors are measured to be $\Delta$m$^2_{32}$ = $2.40\substack{+0.05 \\ -0.04} \times 10^{-3} \textrm{ eV}^2$ and sin$^2$$\theta_{23}$=$0.54\substack{+0.04 \\ -0.03}$. The results are the most precise to date using atmospheric neutrinos, and are compatible with measurements from other neutrino detectors including long-baseline accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2024. Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second "Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter" (MDvDM'24) meeting was held January 8-11, 2024 in Arlington, VA, USA, hosted by Virginia Tech's Center for Neutrino Physics. This document collects contributions from this workshop, providing an overview of activities in the field. MDvDM'24 was the second topical workshop dedicated to the emerging field of mineral detection of neutrinos and dark matter, following a meeting hosted by IFPU in Trieste, Italy in October 2022. Mineral detectors have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, including searching for dark matter, measuring various fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos over gigayear timescales, monitoring nuclear reactors, and nuclear disarmament protocols; both as paleo-detectors using natural minerals that could have recorded the traces of nuclear recoils for timescales as long as a billion years and as detectors recording nuclear recoil events on laboratory timescales using natural or artificial minerals. Contributions to this proceedings discuss the vast physics potential, the progress in experimental studies, and the numerous challenges lying ahead on the path towards mineral detection. These include a better understanding of the formation and annealing of recoil defects in crystals; identifying the best classes of minerals and, for paleo-detectors, understanding their geology; modeling and control of the relevant backgrounds; developing, combining, and scaling up imaging and data analysis techniques; and many others. During the last years, MDvDM has grown rapidly and gained attention. Small-scale experimental efforts focused on establishing various microscopic readout techniques are underway at institutions in North America, Europe and Asia. We are looking ahead to an exciting future full of challenges to overcome, surprises to be encountered, and discoveries lying ahead of us.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole moments of charged leptons in models with pseudo-Dirac sterile fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the impact of a small lepton number violation on charged lepton electric dipole moments - EDMs. Low-scale seesaw models protected by lepton number symmetry and leading to pseudo-Dirac pairs in the neutrino heavy spectrum provide a natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses with potentially testable consequences. Among which, it was thought that the small mass gap in each pair of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos may induce important contribution to the charged lepton EDMs. Recently, it has been shown that the contribution from some of the Feynman diagrams to charged lepton EDMs exactly cancel by virtue of the Ward-Takahashi identity in quantum electrodynamics. We thus consider here the Standard Model minimally extended with pairs of pseudo-Dirac sterile fermions and derive the complete analytical formula at two loops for the charged lepton EDMs. In addition, we numerically evaluate the order of the predicted EDMs consistent with the experimental bounds and constraints such as neutrino oscillation data, charged lepton flavour violating processes, sterile neutrino direct searches, meson decays, sterile neutrino decays, and cosmological and astrophysical observations. We find that, in the minimal setup accommodating neutrino data (masses and mixings) with only two pseudo-Dirac pairs, the predicted electron EDM is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-36})~e\hspace{0.05cm}\mathrm{cm}$, at most, which is much smaller than the current experimental bound and even future sensitivity. Hopefully, the electron EDM might reach future sensitivity, once extra pseudo-Dirac neutrinos are taken into account. The analytical formulae we derive are generic to any model involving pseudo-Dirac pairs in the heavy neutrino spectrum.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of the $p_T$-spectra for identified particles and its relationship with partonic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum $p_T$ spectra of hadrons produced in high-energy collisions. We propose that the partonic distribution be parameterized by its non-extensive entropy and the parton saturation scale $Q_s(x)$. These two variables can be identified from the produced charged hadron distributions and provide important information on the gluon dynamics at the moment of interaction. From this perspective we interpret data from different ALICE multiplicity classes at $\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}= 5.02$ TeV. A multiplicity dependent scaling function is presented and the dependence of the interaction area on multiplicity is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic optical beam steering for superconducting device calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a calibration system based on a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror that is capable of delivering an optical beam over a wavelength range of 180 -- 2000 nm (0.62 -- 6.89 eV) in a sub-Kelvin environment. This portable, integrated system can steer the beam over a $\sim$3 cm $\times$ 3 cm area on the surface of any sensor with a precision of $\sim$100 $\mu$m, enabling characterization of device response as a function of position. This fills a critical need in the landscape of calibration tools for sub-Kelvin devices, including those used for dark matter detection and quantum computing. These communities have a shared goal of understanding the impact of ionizing radiation on device performance, which can be pursued with our system. This paper describes the design of the first-generation calibration system and the results from successfully testing its performance at room temperature and 20 mK.</description>

      <title>Results on Elastic Cross Sections in Proton-Proton Collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 510$ GeV with the STAR Detector at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results on an elastic cross section measurement in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV, obtained with the Roman Pot setup of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The elastic differential cross section is measured in the four-momentum transfer squared range $0.23 \leq -t \leq 0.67$~GeV$^2$. We find that a constant slope $B$ does not fit the data in the aforementioned $t$ range, and we obtain a much better fit using a second-order polynomial for $B(t)$. The $t$ dependence of $B$ is determined using six subintervals of $t$ in the STAR measured $t$ range, and is in good agreement with the phenomenological models. The measured elastic differential cross section $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{dt}$ agrees well with the results obtained at $\sqrt{s} = 546$~GeV for proton--antiproton collisions by the UA4 experiment. We also determine that the integrated elastic cross section within the STAR $t$-range is $\sigma^\mathrm{fid}_\mathrm{el} = 462.1 \pm 0.9 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 1.1 (\mathrm {syst.}) \pm 11.6 (\mathrm {scale})$~$\mu\mathrm{b}$.</description>

      <title>Search for new resonances decaying to pairs of merged diphotons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is presented for an extended Higgs sector with two new particles, X and $\phi$, in the process X $\to$ $\phi\phi$ $\to$ $(\gamma\gamma)(\gamma\gamma)$. Novel neural networks classify events with diphotons that are merged and determine the diphoton masses. The search uses LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. No evidence of such resonances is seen. Upper limits are set on the production cross section versus the resonance masses, representing the most sensitive search in this channel.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the Hints for a 95 GeV Higgs Boson within a 2-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest an explanation for and explore the consequences of the excess around 95 GeV in the di-photon and di-tau invariant mass distributions recently reported by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), together with the discrepancy that has long been observed at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider in the $b\bar b$ invariant mass. Interestingly, the most recent findings announced by the ATLAS collaboration do not contradict, or even support, these intriguing observations. Their search in the di-photon final state similarly reveals an excess of events within the same mass range, albeit with a bit lower significance, thereby corroborating and somewhat reinforcing the observations made by CMS. We demonstrate that the lightest CP-even Higgs boson in the general 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-III can explain simultaneously the observed excesses at approximately 1.3 $\sigma$ C.L. while satisfying up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. Moreover, the 2HDM Type-III predicts an excess in the $pp\to t\bar t H_{\rm SM}$ production channel of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, $H_{\rm SM}$. This effect is caused by a up to 12\% enhancement of the $H_{\rm SM}tt$ Yukawa coupling in comparison to that predicted by the Standard Model. Such an effect can be tested at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which can either discover or exclude the scenario we suggest. This unique characteristic of the 2HDM Type-III makes this scenario with the 95 GeV resonance very attractive for further theoretical and experimental investigations at the (HL-)LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

      <title>The CCube reconstruction algorithm for the SoLid experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SoLid experiment is a very-short-baseline experiment aimed at searching for nuclear reactor-produced active to sterile antineutrino oscillations. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented (the basic detection unit is a 5 cm side cube). High segmentation provides numerous advantages, including the precise location of Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of the considerate antineutrino energy estimator, and a powerful background reduction tool based on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of wavelength-shifting fibres coupled to a photodetector (MPPC). This paper describes the design of the reconstruction algorithm that allows maximum use of the granularity of the detector. The goal of the algorithm is to convert the output of the optical-fibre readout to the list of the detection units from which it originated. This paper provides a performance comparison for three methods and concludes with a choice of the baseline approach for the experiment.</description>
