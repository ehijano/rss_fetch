      <title>Effect of oblique horizontal magnetic field on convection rolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of external horizontal magnetic field applied on the convection rolls obliquely (at an angle $\phi$ with the $x$-axis) in electrically conducting low Prandtl number fluids under the paradigm of the Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection by performing three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The control parameters, namely, the Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$) and the reduced Rayleigh number $r$ (ratio of Rayleigh number to critical Rayleigh number), are varied in the ranges $0 \leq \mathrm{Q} \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq r \leq 20$ for the Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Pr} = 0.1$ and $0.2$ by considering three horizontal aspect ratios ($\Gamma$): $\frac{1}{2}$, $1$ and $2$. In the absence of the magnetic field, the convection starts in the form of steady rolls including the one parallel to the $x$-axis. As the oblique horizontal magnetic field is switched on at an angle $\phi \in (0^\circ, ~90^\circ]$ with the $x$-axis, it is observed that the Lorentz force generated by the component of the magnetic field transverse to the axis of the convection rolls inhibits convection in the form of steady rolls. Thus, with the application of the magnetic field, the convection is suppressed and restarts for a higher Rayleigh number in the form of steady convection rolls. The rolls can either be oriented along the $x$-axis (steady parallel rolls, SPR) or oriented at an angle $45^\circ$ (steady oblique rolls, SOR$^+$) with the $x$-axis depending on the choices of the parameters. A rich bifurcation structure with standing and traveling patterns emerges at higher $r$. The oscillatory instability of steady rolls scales as \( \mathrm{Q}^\alpha \) with distinct exponents for weak and strong magnetic fields. Additionally, heat transfer decreases with increasing \( \phi \) for given \( \mathrm{Q} \) and \( \mathrm{Pr} \).</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pressure balance in proximity of sidewalls in deterministic lateral displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a popular technique for size-based separation of particles. One of the challenges in design of DLD chips is to eliminate the disturbance of fluid flow patterns caused by channel sidewalls intersecting with the pillars matrix. While there are numerous reports in the literature attempting to mitigate this issue by adjusting the gaps between pillars on the sidewalls and the closest ones residing on the bulk grid of DLD array, there are only few works that also configure the axial gap of pillars adjacent to accumulation sidewall to maintain a desired local pressure field. In this work, we study various designs numerically to investigate the effects of geometrical configurations of sidewalls on critical diameter and first stream flux fraction variations across channel. Our results show that regardless of the model used for boundary gap profile, applying a pressure balance scheme can improve the separation performance by reducing the critical diameter variations. In particular, we found that for a given boundary gap distribution, there can be two desired parameter sets with relatively low critical diameter variations. One is related to sufficiently low lateral resistance of interface unit cells next to accumulation sidewall, while the other one emerges by reducing the axial resistance of the interface unit cells to an appropriate extent. We believe that this work can pave the way for designing DLD systems with improved performance, which can be critically important for applications such as separation of rare cells, among others, wherein target species need to be concentrated into as narrow a stream as possible downstream of device to enhance purity and recovery rate simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A tracking algorithm for finite-size particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-wall interactions play a crucially important role in various applications such as microfluidic devices for cell sorting, particle separation, entire class of hydrodynamic filtration and its derivatives, etc. Yet, accurate implementation of interactions between wall and finite-size particle is not trivial when working with the currently available particle tracking algorithms/packages as they typically work with point-wise particles. Herein, we report a particle tracking algorithm that takes into account interactions between particles of finite size and solid objects existing inside computational domain. A particle is modeled as a set of circumferential points on its perimeter. While fluid-particle interactions are captured during the track of particle center, interactions between particle and nearby solid objects are modeled explicitly by examining circumferential points and applying a reflection scheme as needed to ensure impenetrability of solid objects. We also report a modified variant of auxiliary structured grid method to locate hosting cells, which in conjunction with a boundary condition scheme enables the capture of interactions between particle and solid objects. As a proof-of-concept, we numerically and experimentally study the motion of particles within a microfluidic deterministic lateral displacement device. The modeling results successfully demonstrate the zig-zag and bumping displacement modes observed in our experiments. We also study a microfluidic device with pinched flow numerically and validate our results against experimental data from the literature. By demonstrating an almost 8x speedup on a system with 8 Performance threads, our investigations suggest that the particle tracking algorithm and its implementation code can benefit from parallel processing on multi-thread systems by using the OpenMP application programming interface.</description>

      <title>Reynolds Number Effects on Lift Enhancement Mechanisms of Dragonfly Wings: Their Effective Ranges and Determination by Local Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A corrugated structure, rather than a smooth surface, is a characteristic feature of insect wings (e.g., dragonfly wings), which enhances their aerodynamic performance at low Reynolds numbers ($Re \simeq O(10^3)$). However, the mechanisms responsible for these improvements remain largely unexplored. Previous studies have shown that a secondary vortex forms on a flat wing, opposite in sign to the leading-edge vortex (LEV). At $Re = 4000$, the lift enhancement in the corrugated wing is associated with vortex collapse and confinement within the V-shaped region, a part of corrugated structure. Conversely, when there was no lift improvement, the vortex remained intact and erupted without collapsing. In addition, the alternating vortices within the V-shaped region, comprising a negative vortex originating from the LEV and a positive vortex from the secondary vortex, induced a strong negative pressure, thereby further enhancing the lift. However, the working range of these mechanisms has yet to be investigated. In this study, lift enhancement was investigated over a broader Reynolds number range ($100 \leq Re \leq 4000$), focusing on the effective ranges. No characteristic mechanism was observed for $100 \leq Re \leq 500$. For $1000 \leq Re \leq 4000$, the alternating vortices around the V-shaped region were correlated with the improved aerodynamic performance. Furthermore, for $2000 \leq Re \leq 4000$, the secondary vortex collapse plays a major role in lift enhancement. These findings demonstrate that the lift enhancement mechanisms for corrugated wings operate within distinct working ranges depending on the Reynolds number, thereby providing insights into bioinspired aerodynamic designs.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator Modeling of Platelet Geometry and Stress in Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thrombosis involves processes spanning large-scale fluid flow to sub-cellular events such as platelet activation. Traditional CFD approaches often treat blood as a continuum, which can limit their ability to capture these microscale phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a neural operator-based surrogate model to bridge this gap. Our approach employs DeepONet, trained on high-fidelity particle dynamics simulations performed in LAMMPS under a single shear flow condition. The model predicts both platelet membrane deformation and accumulated stress over time, achieving a mode error of ~0.3% under larger spatial filtering radii. At finer scales, the error increases, suggesting a correlation between the DeepONet architecture's capacity and the spatial resolution it can accurately learn. These findings highlight the importance of refining the trunk network to capture localized discontinuities in stress data. Potential strategies include using deeper trunk nets or alternative architectures optimized for graph-structured meshes, further improving accuracy for high-frequency features. Overall, the results demonstrate the promise of neural operator-based surrogates for multi-scale platelet modeling. By reducing computational overhead while preserving accuracy, our framework can serve as a critical component in future simulations of thrombosis and other micro-macro fluid-structure problems.</description>

      <title>Velocity alignment explains Lagrangian irreversibility in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian particles in turbulence separate away from each other faster in the backward in time direction as compared to forward in time. In this work, we show that time irreversibility is kinematically rooted in the fact that, when viewed backward in time, the alignment of particles' relative velocities is better than when viewed forward in time.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of nucleate boiling with a resolved microlayer and conjugate heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a phase-change model based on a geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) framework is extended to simulate nucleate boiling with a resolved microlayer and conjugate heat transfer. Heat conduction in both the fluid and solid domains is simultaneously solved, with Interfacial Heat-Transfer Resistance (IHTR) imposed. The present model is implemented in the open-source software Basilisk with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), which significantly improves computational efficiency. However, the approximate projection method required for AMR introduces strong oscillations within the microlayer due to intense heat and mass transfer. This issue is addressed using a ghost fluid method, allowing nucleate boiling experiments to be successfully replicated. Compared to previous literature studies, the computational cost is reduced by three orders of magnitude. The influence of contact angle is further investigated, revealing consistent thermodynamic effects across different contact angles. Finally, a complete bubble cycle from nucleation to detachment is simulated, which, to our knowledge, has not been reported in the open literature. Reasonable agreement with experimental data is achieved, enabling key factors affecting nucleate boiling simulations in the microlayer regime to be identified, which were previously obscured by limited simulation time.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the Localized Artificial Diffusivity Method for Immiscible and High Density Ratio Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) method is widely regarded as the preferred multi-material regularization scheme for the compact finite difference method, because it is conservative, easy to implement, and generally robust for a wide range of problems. However, traditional LAD methods face significant challenges when applied to flows with large density ratios and when maintaining thermodynamic equilibrium across material interfaces. These limitations arise from the formulation of the artificial diffusivity flux and the reliance on enthalpy diffusion for interface regularization. Additionally, traditional LAD methods struggle to ensure stability for large density ratios, fail to maintain a finite interface thickness, and are therefore unsuitable for modeling immiscible interfaces. In this work, we discuss the origins of these issues in traditional LAD methods and propose modifications which enable the simulation of large density ratio and immiscible flows. The proposed method targets the artificial diffusion fluxes at gradients and ringing in the volume fraction, rather than the mass fraction in traditional methods, to consistently regularize large density ratio interfaces. Furthermore, the proposed method introduces an artificial bulk density diffusion term to enforce equilibrium conditions. To address the challenge of modeling immiscible flows, a conservative diffuse interface term is incorporated to ensure a finite interface thickness. Specific consideration is taken in the method to ensure that these crucial properties are maintained for N-material flows. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of canonical test cases, and its accuracy is validated by comparison with experimental data on microbubble collapse in water. These results highlight the method's robustness and its ability to overcome the limitations of traditional LAD approaches.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Our solution reveals a dual formulation in terms of two interacting Euler ensembles--one for hydrodynamic and another for magnetic circulation. This replaces empirical scaling laws with an infinite set of power terms with calculable decay exponents, some of which appear as complex-conjugate pairs related to the Riemann zeta function. A key result of our analysis is the explicit dependence of the solution on the Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pr} = \nu/\eta$), leading to a phase transition at $\mathrm{Pr} = 1$. In the $\mathrm{Pr}&lt;1$ regime, turbulence is dominated by hydrodynamic fluctuations, while for $\mathrm{Pr}&gt;1$, two distinct solutions emerge: a metastable one in which magnetic fluctuations grow with $\mathrm{Pr}$ and a stable one where they remain balanced with hydrodynamic fluctuations. We compare our theoretical predictions with recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) and discuss their implications for astrophysical plasmas, fusion devices, and laboratory MHD experiments. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding MHD turbulence and its dependence on fundamental parameters, offering a new perspective on turbulence in highly conducting fluids.</description>

      <title>Stabilization Analysis and Mode Recognition of Kerosene Supersonic Combustion: A Deep Learning Approach Based on Res-CNN-beta-VAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scramjet engine is a key propulsion system for hypersonic vehicles, leveraging supersonic airflow to achieve high specific impulse, making it a promising technology for aerospace applications. Understanding and controlling the complex interactions between fuel injection, turbulent combustion, and aerodynamic effects of compressible flows are crucial for ensuring stable combustion in scramjet engines. However, identifying stable modes in scramjet combustors is often challenging due to limited experimental measurement means and extremely complex spatiotemporal evolution of supersonic turbulent combustion. This work introduces an innovative deep learning framework that combines dimensionality reduction via the Residual Convolutional Neural Network-beta-Variational Autoencoder (Res-CNN-beta-VAE) model with unsupervised clustering (K-means) to identify and analyze dynamical combustion modes in a supersonic combustor. By mapping high-dimensional data of combustion snapshots to a reduced three-dimensional latent space, the Res-CNN-beta-VAE model captures the essential temporal and spatial features of flame behaviors and enables the observation of transitions between combustion states. By analyzing the standard deviation of latent variable trajectories, we introduce a novel method for objectively distinguishing between dynamic transitions, which provides a scalable and expert-independent alternative to traditional classification methods. Besides, the unsupervised K-means clustering approach effectively identifies the complex interplay between the cavity and the jet-wake stabilization mechanisms, offering new insights into the system's behavior across different gas-to-liquid mass flow ratios (GLRs).</description>

Abstract: Starting from the governing equations for geophysical flows, by means of a thin-shell approximation and a tangent plane approximation, we derive the equations describing, at leading order, the nonlinear ice-drift flow for regions centered around the North Pole. An exact solution is derived in the material/Lagrangian formalism, describing a superposition of oscillations, a mean Ekman flow and a geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Universal mean velocity profile in polymeric flows at maximum drag reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provided a sufficient concentration of long-chain polymers in a Newtonian solvent, turbulent wall-bounded flows exhibit a universal state known as Maximum Drag Reduction (MDR). Through direct numerical simulations, we show that the wall-normal kinetic energy flux characterising Newtonian wall-bounded turbulence is suppressed at MDR, and that the polymers mainly sustain velocity fluctuations. In agreement with the experimental data, we derive a universal expression for the mean velocity profile no longer dependent on characteristic quantities of wall-bounded turbulence.</description>

      <title>Effects of Intrinsic Flame Instabilities on Nitrogen Oxide Formation in Laminar Premixed Ammonia/Hydrogen/Air Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the characteristics of nitrogen oxide (NO) formation in two-dimensional (2D) laminar premixed ammonia/hydrogen/air flames and the impact of thermodiffusively driven intrinsic flame instabilities (IFIs). To this end, a set of three highly resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) at lean ambient conditions and varying hydrogen fraction in the fuel blend are conducted. The analysis of these DNS reveals a significant increase of NO formation in positively curved regions of the flame, particularly for lower hydrogen fuel fractions, while negatively curved areas exhibit reduced NO concentrations. However, despite the strong variations of local mass fractions of NO in the flame sheet, the mean mass fraction in the post-flame region remains close to the solution from a one-dimensional flame. Through a representative flame segment analysis of positively curved, negatively curved, and flat regions, key reactions contributing to NO formation are determined, with the HNO pathway being the predominant production and the deNOx pathway being the predominant consumption pathway across all cases. Thermal NO plays no significant role in the considered cases. Generally, the peaks of NO production shift to lower values of progress variable in the negatively curved regions, leading to an annihilation of the production and consumption terms in the low hydrogen fuel fraction case. The decrease of NO production is found to be mainly driven by changes of the radical concentrations, rather than changes of the temperature-dependent reaction rate coefficients.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion via iterative quantitative homogenization: an overview of the main ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is the fundamental ansatz of phenomenological theories of passive scalar turbulence, and has been confirmed numerically and experimentally to an extraordinary extent. The purpose of this survey is to discuss our recent result, in which we construct a class of incompressible vector fields that have many of the properties observed in a fully turbulent velocity field, and for which the associated scalar advection-diffusion equation generically displays anomalous diffusion. Our main contribution is to propose an analytical framework in which to study anomalous diffusion via a backward cascade of renormalized eddy viscosities.</description>

      <title>An Acoustic Inversion-Based Flow Measurement Model in 3D Hydrodynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study extends the flow measurement method initially proposed in [22] to three-dimensional scenarios, addressing the growing need for accurate and efficient non-contact flow measurement techniques in complex hydrodynamic environments. Compared to conventional Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and remote sensing-based flow monitoring, the proposed method enables high-resolution, continuous water velocity measurement, making it well-suited for hazardous environments such as floods, strong currents, and sediment-laden rivers. Building upon the original approach, we develop an enhanced model that incorporates multiple emission directions and flexible configurations of receivers. These advancements improve the adaptability and accuracy of the method when applied to three-dimensional flow fields. To evaluate its feasibility, we conducted extensive numerical simulations designed to mimic real-world hydrodynamic conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively handles diverse and complex flow field configurations, highlighting its potential for practical applications in water resource management and hydraulic engineering.</description>

      <title>A numerical method based on quasi-Lagrangian Voronoi cells for two-phase flows with large density contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use a moving Voronoi and sharp interface approach for simulating two-phase flows. At every time step, the mesh is generated anew from Voronoi seeds that behave as material points. The paper is a continuation of our previous works on moving Voronoi meshes where we have considered single phase incompressible and compressible flows. In the context of quasi-Lagrangian Voronoi simulations, problems with large density contrasts (such as water and air interface) are being treated here for the first time to the best of our knowledge. This is made possible through a remapping stage, which relies on a filtering of a color function. The resulting semi-implicit scheme is conservative and robust, allowing us to simulate both compressible and incompressible flows, including shock waves and surface tension.</description>

      <title>On Local Minimum Entropy Principle of High-Order Schemes for Relativistic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the minimum entropy principle (MEP) for the relativistic Euler equations with a broad class of equations of state (EOSs) and addresses the challenge of preserving the local version of the discovered MEP in high-order numerical schemes. At the continuous level, we find out a family of entropy pairs for the relativistic Euler equations and provide rigorous analysis to prove the strict convexity of entropy under a necessary and sufficient condition. At the numerical level, we develop a rigorous framework for designing provably entropy-preserving high-order schemes that ensure both physical admissibility and the discovered MEP. The relativistic effects, coupled with the abstract and general EOS formulation, introduce significant challenges not encountered in the nonrelativistic case or with the ideal EOS. In particular, entropy is a highly nonlinear and implicit function of the conservative variables, making it particularly difficult to enforce entropy preservation. To address these challenges, we establish a series of auxiliary theories via highly technical inequalities. Another key innovation is the use of geometric quasi-linearization (GQL), which reformulates the nonlinear constraints into equivalent linear ones by introducing additional free parameters. These advancements form the foundation of our entropy-preserving analysis. We propose novel, robust, locally entropy-preserving high-order frameworks. A central challenge is accurately estimating the local minimum of entropy, particularly in the presence of shock waves at unknown locations. To address this, we introduce two new approaches for estimating local lower bounds of specific entropy, which prove effective for both smooth and discontinuous problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our entropy-preserving methods maintain high-order accuracy while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations.</description>

      <title>Development of a Cost-Effective Simulation Tool for Loss of Flow Accident Transients in High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to further expand the capability of the coarse-grid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach, SubChCFD, to effectively simulate transient and buoyancy-influenced flows, which are critical in accident analyses of High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). It has been demonstrated in our previous work that SubChCFD is highly adaptable to HTGR fuel designs and performs exceptionally well in modelling steady-state processes. In this study, the approach is extended to simulate a Loss of Flow Accident (LOFA) transient, where coolant circulation is disrupted, causing the transition from forced convection to buoyancy-driven natural circulation within the reactor core. To enable SubChCFD to capture the complex physics involved, corrections were introduced to the empirical correlations to account for the effects of flow unsteadiness, property variation and buoyancy.
  A 1/12th sector of the reactor core, representing the smallest symmetric unit, was modelled using a coarse mesh of approximately 60 million cells. This mesh size is about 6% of that required for a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model, where mesh sizes can typically reach the order of 1 billion cells for such configurations. Simulation results show that SubChCFD effectively captures the thermal hydraulic behaviours of the reactor during a LOFA transient, producing predictions in good agreement with RANS simulations while significantly reducing computational cost.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based Godunov corrections for approximate Riemann solvers using bi-fidelity learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann problem is fundamental in the computational modeling of hyperbolic partial differential equations, enabling the development of stable and accurate upwind schemes. While exact solvers provide robust upwinding fluxes, their high computational cost necessitates approximate solvers. Although approximate solvers achieve accuracy in many scenarios, they produce inaccurate solutions in certain cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose constructing neural network-based surrogate models, trained using supervised learning, designed to map interior and exterior conservative state variables to the corresponding exact flux. Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches: one utilizing a vanilla neural network and the other employing a bi-fidelity neural network. The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through applications to one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to actively control wakes and noise from flow past a cylinder by leveraging acoustic-based pressure feedback. A hydrophone array captures downstream signals, enabling a DRL agent to adjust jet actuators on the cylinder's surface in real-time. The method reduces noise levels by up to 9.5\% and drag coefficients by up to 23.8\%, effectively minimizing flow-induced vibrations. This highlights the potential of DRL-driven active flow control for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Large Airfoil Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of a Large Airfoil Model (LAM), a transformative approach for answering technical questions on airfoil aerodynamics, requires a vast dataset and a model to leverage it. To build this foundation, a novel probabilistic machine learning approach, A Deep Airfoil Prediction Tool (ADAPT), has been developed. ADAPT makes uncertainty-aware predictions of airfoil pressure coefficient ($C_p$) distributions by harnessing experimental data and incorporating measurement uncertainties. By employing deep kernel learning, performing Gaussian Process Regression in a ten-dimensional latent space learned by a neural network, ADAPT effectively handles unstructured experimental datasets. In tandem, Airfoil Surface Pressure Information Repository of Experiments (ASPIRE), the first large-scale, open-source repository of airfoil experimental data has been developed. ASPIRE integrates century-old historical data with modern reports, forming an unparalleled resource of real-world pressure measurements. This addresses a critical gap left by prior repositories, which relied primarily on numerical simulations. Demonstrative results for three airfoils show that ADAPT accurately predicts $C_p$ distributions and aerodynamic coefficients across varied flow conditions, achieving a mean absolute error in enclosed area ($\text{MAE}_\text{enclosed}$) of 0.029. ASPIRE and ADAPT lay the foundation for an interactive airfoil analysis tool driven by a large language model, enabling users to perform design tasks based on natural language questions rather than explicit technical input.</description>

      <title>Energy and entropy conserving compatible finite elements with upwinding for the thermal shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new compatible finite element formulation of the thermal shallow water equations that conserves energy and mathematical entropies given by buoyancy-related quadratic tracer variances. Our approach relies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time integration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The proposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes, monotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The fully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level. The ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and upwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally unstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different transient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability where including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy. The second is a double vortex where a constrained fully discrete formulation is shown to achieve exact entropy conservation in time.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Feature Extraction: a novel approach for enhancing data-driven surrogate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate model can replace the parametric full-order model (FOM) by an approximation model, which can significantly improve the efficiency of optimization design and reduce the complexity of engineering systems. However, due to limitations in efficiency and accuracy, the applications of high-dimensional surrogate models are still challenging. In the present study, we propose a method for extracting hidden features to simplify high-dimensional problems, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of surrogate models. We establish a goal-oriented feature extraction (GFE) neural network through indirect supervised learning. We constrained the distance between hidden features based on the differences in the target output. This means that in the hidden feature space, cases that are closer in distance output approximately the same, and vice versa. The proposed hidden feature learning method can significantly reduce the dimensionality and nonlinearity of the surrogate model, thereby improving modeling accuracy and generalization capability. To demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed ideas, We conducted numerical experiments on three popular surrogate models. The modeling results of typical high-dimensional mathematical cases and aerodynamic performance cases of ONERA M6 wings show that goal-oriented feature extraction significantly improves the modeling accuracy. Goal-oriented feature extraction can effectively reduce the error distribution of predicting cases and reduce the convergence and robustness differences caused by various data-driven surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired Drone Rotors for Reduced Aeroacoustic Noise and Improved Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is surging across several industries, paralleled by growing demand for these UAVs. However, the noise emitted by UAVs remains a significant impediment to their widespread use even though in areas such as product delivery, they can be more environmentally friendly than traditional delivery methods. Nature has often been a source of inspiration for devices that are efficient and eco-friendly. In the current study, we leverage the previous work by Seo et al. (Bioinsp. Biomimetics, 16 (4):046019, 2021) on the aeroacoustics of flapping wing flight in mosquitoes and fruit flies to propose and examine a simple strategy for reducing the aeroacoustic noise from drone rotors. In particular, inspired by these insects, we explore how an increase in the planform area of the rotor could be used to reduce the rotation rate and the associated aeroacoustic noise from small-scale rotors. The study employs a sharp-interface immersed boundary solver for the flow simulations and the aeroacoustic sound is predicted by the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. Simulations indicate that the simple strategy of employing rotors with larger planform areas could lead not just to reduced aeroacoustic noise but improved power economy as well.</description>

      <title>A toy model of turbulent shear flow using vortons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel toy model for shear flows, exploiting the spatial intermittency and the scale separation between large-scale flows and small-scale structures. The model is highly sparse, focusing exclusively on the most intense structures, which are represented by vortons: dynamically regularized quasi-singularities that experience rapid distortion from the large-scale shear. The vortons, in turn, influence the large-scale flow through the sub-grid stress tensor. Despite its simplicity, the model displays an interesting transition between two distinct regimes: (i) a laminar regime, where dissipation is entirely attributed to the large-scale flow, and the vortons dynamics is essentially diffusive, and (ii) a turbulent regime, in which most of the dissipation arises from the vortons. These regimes correspond to different scalings of dissipation and the Grashof number as functions of the Reynolds number, with power-law relationships that resemble those observed in classical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Data-driven prediction of reversal of large-scale circulation in turbulent convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale circulation (LSC) quasi-stably emerges in the turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and intermittently reverses its rotational direction in two-dimensional turbulent convection. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of the intermittent reversals of the LSC in a two-dimensional square domain are performed, and the time series of the total angular momentum indicating the rotational direction of the LSC is predicted by reservoir computing whose input consists of the shear rates and temperatures at six locations on the sidewalls. The total angular momentum in the simulation after times shorter than half the typical duration of the quasi-stable states is successfully reproduced by the locally-measurable quantities on the sidewalls because the secondary rolls accompanied by the boundary flow characterize the reversal of the LSC. The successful prediction by such sparse input derived from local measurements on the sidewalls demonstrates that the reservoir computing prediction of the reversal is feasible in laboratory experiments and industrial applications. On the other hand, long-term prediction often provides the total angular momentum opposite in sign to the one in the simulations in the late parts of long quasi-stable states. The statistical independence of each reversal implies that the prediction after the reversal is difficult or even impossible, and the training data in the late part in the long quasi-stable state, which rarely appears, is contaminated by the statistically-independent angular momentum in the subsequent quasi-stable state.</description>

      <title>An analytical solution for horizontal velocity profiles in the hurricane boundary layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical analyses of the hurricane boundary layer have traditionally relied on slab models, which provide a limited description of wind profiles. Literature on height-resolving methods is typically based on linear analyses, which may fall short of capturing the full sensitivity of the solution to variations in input parameters. This work proposes an approximate analytical solution of a nonlinear single-column model for horizontal winds based on a constant eddy viscosity assumption and valid outside the eyewall. Building on literature that uses a linearized system of equations, we account for the nonlinearities through a series expansion approach. We find that a first order correction is sufficient for most practical cases. This solution helps provide a simplified understanding of the sensitivity of the radial and tangential wind profiles to input parameters such as the distance from the hurricane eye and the Coriolis force.</description>

Abstract: Engineering, medicine, and the fundamental sciences broadly rely on flow simulations, making performant computational fluid dynamics solvers an open source software mainstay. A previous work made MFC 3.0 a published open source source solver with many features. MFC 5.0 is a marked update to MFC 3.0, including a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods and the introduction of GPU and APU (or superchip) acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF Frontier and LLNL El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-GPU/APU performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice. With these capabilities, MFC has evolved into a tool for conducting simulations that many engineering challenge problems hinge upon. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, $N$-fluid phase change, Euler--Euler and Euler--Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF Frontier and LLNL El Capitan see efficiencies within 5% of ideal to over 90% of their respective system sizes. Strong scaling results for a 16-time increase in device count show parallel efficiencies over 90% on OLCF Frontier. Other MFC improvements include ensuring code resilience and correctness with a continuous integration suite, the use of metaprogramming to reduce code length and maintain performance portability, and efficient computational representations for chemical reactions and thermodynamics via code generation with Pyrometheus.</description>

      <title>Flow birefringence of shear-thinning fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell</title>

Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional active turbulence in microswimmer suspensions: simulations and modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active turbulence is a paradigmatic and fascinating example of self-organized motion at large scales occurring in active matter. We employ massive hydrodynamic simulations of suspensions of resolved model microswimmers to tackle the phenomenon in semi-dilute conditions at a mesoscopic level. We measure the kinetic energy spectrum and we detect a $k^{-3}$ power law regime. The velocity distributions are of L\'evy type, a distinct difference with inertial turbulence. Furthermore, we propose a reduced order dynamical deterministic model for active turbulence, inspired to shell models for classical turbulence, whose numerical and analytical study confirms the spectrum powerlaw observed in the simulations and reveals hints of a non-Gaussian, intermittent, physics of active turbulence. Direct numerical simulations and modelling also agree in pointing to a phenomenological picture whereby, in the absence of an energy cascade \`a la Richardson forbidden by the low Reynolds number regime, it is the coupling between fluid velocity gradients and bacterial orientation that gives rise to a multiscale dynamics.</description>
