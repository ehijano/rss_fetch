      <title>Measurement of production branching ratio after muon nuclear capture reaction of Al and Si isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Muon nuclear capture is a reaction between a muon and a proton inside a nucleus through weak interactions. This reaction results in the formation of an excited nucleus, which subsequently de-excites by emitting several particles. Examination of the excited state allows for an investigation of the properties of nuclear excitation and particle emission in highly excited nuclei. Purpose: This study investigates muon nuclear capture of 27Al and 28,29,30Si, focusing on determining the absolute production branching ratio (BR) following muon nuclear capture and subsequent particle emissions. By measuring the absolute production BR, we can collect valuable information on the excitation energy distribution of muon nuclear capture. Methods: Measurements were conducted using the in-beam activation method at two pulsed muon facilities: RIKEN-RAL at RAL and MLF at JPARC. Absolute BRs were determined by measuring the irradiated muon number using a plastic scintillator and the \b{eta}-delayed {\gamma}-rays emitted from the produced nuclei using germanium detectors. Results: The absolute production branching ratios of muon nuclear capture on 27Al and 28,29,30Si were obtained with the highest accuracy to date. Predominant neutron emissions, even-odd atomic number dependence on particle emission probabilities, and influence of the neutron excess were observed. These results were compared with previous measurements and theoretical models and discussed regarding the excitation energy distribution, particle emission mechanism, and nuclear properties, such as resonance in the isovector transition. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of considering nuclear structure effects, even-odd effects of proton and neutron numbers, neutron excess, nucleon pairing effect, and particle emission mechanisms, in the context of the muon nuclear capture reaction.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge radius measurement with low-energy electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge radius is one of the most basic characteristics of the nucleons. The proton charge radius is especially of great importance for many applications such as the structure studies of the atomic nuclei, the determination of the Rydberg constant and QED tests. Its determination is thus a hot topic in several physics communities due to inconsistent results using electron scattering, atomic and muonic hydrogen spectroscopy. A new measurement of the proton and deuteron charge radii with low energy electron scattering is being conducted in the Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science (RARiS), Tohoku University, Japan. The current status of the experiment is discussed in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Re-examination of fusion hindrance in astrophysical $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and $^{12}$C+$^{13}$C reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine the energy dependence of fusion cross sections at extremely low energies is crucial for various astrophysical processes. In the previous study by Jiang et al. [Phys. Rev. C75, 015803 (2007)], it was concluded that fusion cross sections for the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C system rapidly drop off as the energy decreases. We here re-examine this hindrance phenomenon. While the previous study fitted the logarithmic slope $L(E)$ of fusion cross sections with a function of $L(E)=A+B/E^n$ and searched the optimum value of $A$ and $B$ with $n=1.5$, we refit the data with the same function for $L(E)$ but by releasing the restriction on $n$. We find that the optimum values of $n$ significantly deviates from $n=1.5$, resulting in the absence of hindrance of fusion cross sections both in the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and the $^{12}$C+$^{13}$C systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding the correlation between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative correlation between the magnitudes of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) has been accurately measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC collider. As a function of the centrality of the collision, it changes sign and varies non-monotonically. We show that this is naturally explained by two combined effects. The first effect is a skewness in initial-state fluctuations, which is quantified by the correlation between the geometry-driven elliptic deformation in the reaction plane and the fluctuation-driven triangularity $\varepsilon_3$. We introduce an intensive measure of this skewness, which is generically of order unity and depends weakly on the system size and centrality. We evaluate its magnitude using Monte Carlo simulations of the initial state, which show that it is sensitive to the nucleon width. The second effect is the fluctuation of impact parameter relative to centrality classifiers used by experiment. The ATLAS collaboration uses two different centrality classifiers, the multiplicity $N_{ch}$ and the transverse energy $E_T$. We fit both sets of results for Pb+Pb collisions up to $\approx 40\%$ centrality with a single parameter, the intensive mixed skewness. Its value inferred from experiment agrees with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Improvised Nuclear Weapons with 60%-Enriched Uranium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we show that as little as 40 kg of 60%-enriched uranium can be used to build a crude nuclear weapon with a kiloton yield. While too large to fit on a missile, such a weapon could be delivered by shipping container. This analysis is motivated by the June 2025 Israeli and US attacks on Iran, especially the bombings of the nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. The Iranian stockpile of approximately 408 kg of 60%-enriched uranium is, at the time of writing, inaccessible to IAEA inspectors and stored in secret. The rapid clandestine relocation of this material in June 2025 creates an opportunity for aspiring nuclear terrorists to divert an amount that could be used in the construction of an improvised gun-type nuclear weapon in the style of Little Boy.</description>

      <title>Understanding neutrino pion production with the GiBUU model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pion production is a major source of systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation measurements. We report a systematic investigation of neutrino-induced pion production using MINERvA and MicroBooNE data within the GiBUU theoretical framework. The analysis begins by establishing baseline model parameters using inclusive and pionless data from MINERvA, MicroBooNE, and T2K experiments. We then examine the role of in-medium effects, including resonance broadening and nucleon-nucleon final-state interactions. While agreement with individual datasets can be achieved through specific model configurations, we demonstrate the difficulty of a unified description across all experiments: MINERvA measurements prefer minimum in-medium modifications, whereas MicroBooNE data require the maximum in-medium enhancement, revealing the complexity and richness of the underlying nuclear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electric-charge-dependent directed flow splitting of produced quarks in Au+Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report directed flow ($v_1$) of multistrange baryons ($\Xi$ and $\Omega$) and improved $v_1$ data for $K^{-}$, $\bar{p}$, $\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\phi$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$27 and 200 GeV from the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We focus on particles whose constituent quarks are not transported from the incoming nuclei but instead are produced in the collisions. At intermediate impact parameters, we examine quark coalescence behavior for particle combinations with identical quark content, and search for any departure from this behavior (``splitting'') for combinations having non-identical quark content. Under the assumption of quark coalescence for produced quarks, the splitting strength appears to increase with the electric charge difference of the constituent quarks in the combinations, consistent with electromagnetic effect expectations.</description>

      <title>Convergence on the Proton Drip-Line in Thulium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct observation of proton emission for very small Q-values is often unfeasible due to the long partial half-lives of the proton emission channel associated with tunneling through the Coulomb barrier. Therefore, proton emitters with very small decay energies may require the masses of both parent and daughter nuclei in order to establish them as proton unbound. Nuclear mass models have been used to predict the proton drip-line of the thulium (Tm) isotopic chain ($Z=69$), but until now the proton separation energy has not been experimentally tested. Mass measurements were performed using a Multiple Reflection Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (MR-TOF-MS) at TRIUMF's TITAN facility to conclusively map the limit of proton-bound Tm. The masses of neutron-deficient, $^{149}$Tm and $^{150}$Tm, combined with measurements of $^{149m,g}$Er (which were found to deviate from literature by $\approx$150 keV), provide the first experimental confirmation that $^{149}$Tm is the first proton-unbound nuclide in the Tm chain. Our measurements also enable the strength of the $N=82$ neutron shell gap to be determined at the Tm proton drip-line, providing evidence supporting its continued existence.</description>

      <title>New measurement of $^{50}$Cr and $^{53}$Cr (n,$\gamma$) cross sections at n_TOF: a call for chromium nuclear data revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $^{50}$Cr and $^{53}$Cr are very relevant in criticality safety benchmarks related to nuclear reactors. The discrepancies of up to 30% between the neutron capture cross section evaluations have an important effect on the $k_{eff}$ and $k_{\infty}$ in criticality benchmarks particularly sensitive to chromium. In this work, the $^{50,53}$Cr(n,$\gamma$) cross sections are to be determined between 1 and 100 keV with an 8-10% accuracy following the requirements of the NEA High Priority Request List (HPRL) to solve the current discrepancies. We have measured these reactions by the time-of-flight technique at the EAR1 experimental area of the n_TOF facility, using an array of four C$_6$D$_6$ detectors with very low neutron sensitivity. The highly-enriched samples used are significantly thinner than in previous measurements, thus minimizing the multiple-scattering effects. We have produced, and analysed with the R-matrix analysis code SAMMY, capture yields featuring 33 resonances of $^{50}$Cr and 51 of $^{53}$Cr with an accuracy between 5% and 9%, hence fulfilling the requirements made by the NEA. The differential and integral cross sections have been compared to previous data and evaluations. The new measured $^{50,53}$Cr(n,$\gamma$) cross sections provide a valuable input for upcoming evaluations, which are deemed necessary given that the results presented herein do not support the increase in both cross sections proposed in the recent INDEN evaluation.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Spin-Density Matrix Elements in $\phi(1020)\to K_S^0K_L^0$ Photoproduction with a Linearly Polarized Photon Beam at $E_\gamma=8.2-8.8$ GeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the spin-density matrix elements (SDMEs) for the photoproduction of $\phi(1020)$ off of the proton in its decay to $K_S^0K_L^0$, using 105 pb$^{-1}$ of data collected with a linearly polarized photon beam using the GlueX experiment. The SDMEs are measured in nine bins of the squared four-momentum transfer $t$ in the range $-t=0.15-1.0$ GeV$^2$, providing the first measurement of their $t$-dependence for photon beam energies $E_\gamma = 8.2-8.8$ GeV. We confirm the dominance of Pomeron exchange in this region, and put constraints on the contribution of other Regge exchanges. We also find that helicity amplitudes where the helicity of the photon and the $\phi(1020)$ differ by two units are negligible.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the deuteron mass radius via near-threshold $\rho^0$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ meson photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of near-threshold photoproduction of $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons on a deuterium target, utilizing published datasets from DESY and SLAC for $\rho^0$ and $\omega$ production, as well as data from the LEPS and CLAS Collaborations for $\phi$ production. In extracting the deuteron mass radius, we adopt a dipole parametrization for the scalar gravitational form factor, which effectively captures the $|t|$-dependence of the differential cross sections associated with vector meson photoproduction. In addition, results from alternative commonly used form factor parametrizations are also considered and compared. Employing the vector meson dominance (VMD) framework and invoking low-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theorems, we extract the deuteron mass radius from near-threshold photoproduction data of $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons. The mass radii obtained from the various datasets are found to be consistent within statistical uncertainties, yielding an average value of $2.03 \pm 0.13$ fm under the dipole form assumption. We also provide a detailed discussion of the sensitivity of the extracted radius to different choices of gravitational form factor models. Our result represents a significant improvement in precision compared to earlier estimates based solely on $\phi$ meson photoproduction, offering new constraints for theoretical models of nuclear structure and deepening our understanding of the mass distribution within the deuteron.</description>

      <title>Higher order flow coefficients -- A Messenger of QCD medium formed in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic flow and fluctuations are sensitive observables of the initial state effects in heavy ion collisions and are characterized by the medium properties and final state interactions. Using event-shape observables, one can constrain the probability distributions of anisotropic flow coefficients, thus reducing the linear and nonlinear contributions in the measured higher-order harmonics. In this paper, we use transverse spherocity as an event shape observable to study the flow coefficients and elliptic flow fluctuations. Transverse spherocity is found to have a strong correlation with elliptic flow and its fluctuations. We exploit this feature of transverse spherocity to remove the contribution to elliptic flow from higher-order harmonics. The study is performed in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using a multi-phase transport model. The multi-particle Q-cumulant method estimates the anisotropic flow coefficients, which reduces the non-flow contributions. We observe a stronger system response to the flow coefficients for the events with smaller values of elliptic flow.</description>

      <title>Proton radioactivity in deformed nuclei with microscopic optical potential: a novel angular-dependent emission mechanism in the nanosecond-emitter $^{149}$Lu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first microscopic description of proton radioactivity in $^{149}$Lu, the most oblate deformed proton emitter known, using a deformed microscopic optical potential derived from $ab\ initio$ nuclear matter calculations. We predict a novel angular-dependent phenomenon unprecedented in spherical proton emitters: the disappearance of classically allowed regions at small polar angles $(\theta\leq 21^\circ)$. Combining the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin penetration probabilities and the assault frequency of the emitted proton estimated with a new harmonic-oscillator-inspired scheme, our framework yields a half-life $T_{1/2}=467^{+143}_{-108}$ ns for $^{149}$Lu, in excellent agreement within uncertainties with the experimental value $450^{+170}_{-100}$ ns. Deformation analysis rigorously excludes configurations with $|\beta_2|\geq 0.32$. Extensions to $^{150, 151}$Lu and their isomers also achieve excellent agreement with experimental half-life data. We further predict $^{148}$Lu as another highly oblate $(\beta_2 = -0.166)$ proton emitter with a half-life of 4.42 ns. This work validates deformed microscopic optical potentials as a robust predictive tool for drip-line proton emitters and provides quantitative evidence for deformation effects in exotic decays.</description>

Abstract: We build up a complete description of QCD phase structure by applying the parametrization of the chiral and deconfinement order parameters upon the calculations from functional QCD approaches. In particular in the first order phase transition region at high chemical potential, both the phase transition line using Maxwell construction and the coexistence boundary lines from the spinodal decompostion are determined. We compute the thermodynamic quantities including the number density, the energy density, the pressure and also the free energy for both stable and unstable phases of QCD. Additionally, after applying a phenomenological description of the inhomogeneity of the QCD free energy, we obtain the surface tension of the first order phase transition of QCD.</description>
