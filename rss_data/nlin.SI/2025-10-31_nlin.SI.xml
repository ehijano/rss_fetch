      <title>On formulation of the NQC variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nijhoff-Quispel-Capel (NQC) equation is a general lattice quadrilateral equation presented in terms of a function $S(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ serve as extra parameters. It can be viewed as counterpart of Q3 equation which is the second top equation in the Adler-Bobenko-Suris list. In this paper, we review some known formulations of the NQC variable $S(a,b)$, such as the Cauchy matrix approach, the eigenfunction approach and via a spectral Wronskian. We also present a new perspective to formulate $S(a,b)$ from the eigenfunctions of a Lax pair of the lattice (non-potential) modified Korteweg de Vries equation. A new Dbar problem is introduced and employed in the derivation.</description>

      <title>From dual gauge theories to dual spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This brief review surveys recent progress driven by the gauge/Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) correspondence. This connection has proven to be a powerful tool for discovering novel integrable lattice spin models in statistical mechanics by exploiting dualities in supersymmetric gauge theories. In recent years, research has demonstrated the use of dual gauge theories to construct new lattice spin models that are dual to Ising-like models.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Scaling limit of stochastic Box-Ball systems and PushTASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Box-Ball System (SBBS), a probabilistic cellular automaton that generalizes the classic Takahashi-Satsuma Box-Ball System. In SBBS, particles are transported by a carrier with a fixed capacity that may fail to pick up any given particle with a fixed probability $\epsilon$. This model interpolates between two known integrable systems: the Box-Ball System (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$) and the PushTASEP (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 1$). We show that the long-term behavior of SBBS is governed by isolated particles and the occasional emergence of short solitons, which can form longer solitons but are more likely to fall apart. More precisely, we first show that all particles are isolated except for a $1/\sqrt{n}$-fraction of times in any given $n$ steps, and solitons keep forming for this fraction of times. We then show that under diffusive scaling, both SBBS (for any carrier capacity) and PushTASEP converge weakly to semimartingale reflecting Brownian Motions (SRBMs) on the Weyl chamber with explicit covariance and reflection matrices, which are consistent with the microscale relations between these systems. The reflection matrix for SBBS is determined by how 2-solitons behave and exhibit ``solitonic bias'' visible in the diffusive scale. Our proof relies on a new, extended SRBM invariance principle that we develop in this work. This principle can handle processes with complex boundary behavior that can be written as "overdetermined" Skorokhod decompositions, which is crucial for analyzing the complex solitonic interaction in SBBS. We believe this tool may be of independent interest.</description>
