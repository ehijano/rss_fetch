      <title>Probabilistic Shoenfield Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides the theoretical framework of Probabilistic Shoenfield Machines (PSMs), an extension of the classical Shoenfield Machine that models randomness in the computation process. PSMs are brought in contexts where deterministic computation is insufficient, such as randomized algorithms. By allowing transitions to multiple possible states with certain probabilities, PSMs can solve problems and make decisions based on probabilistic outcomes, hence expanding the variety of possible computations. We provide an overview of PSMs, detailing their formal definitions as well as the computation mechanism and their equivalence with Non-deterministic Shoenfield Machines (NSM).</description>

      <title>Normative Conditional Reasoning as a Fragment of HOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the mechanization of (preference-based) conditional normative reasoning. Our focus is on Aqvist's system E for conditional obligation, and its extensions. Our mechanization is achieved via a shallow semantical embedding in Isabelle/HOL. We consider two possible uses of the framework. The first one is as a tool for meta-reasoning about the considered logic. We employ it for the automated verification of deontic correspondences (broadly conceived) and related matters, analogous to what has been previously achieved for the modal logic cube. The equivalence is automatically verified in one direction, leading from the property to the axiom. The second use is as a tool for assessing ethical arguments. We provide a computer encoding of a well-known paradox (or impossibility theorem) in population ethics, Parfit's repugnant conclusion. While some have proposed overcoming the impossibility theorem by abandoning the presupposed transitivity of ''better than'', our formalisation unveils a less extreme approach, suggesting among other things the option of weakening transitivity suitably rather than discarding it entirely. Whether the presented encoding increases or decreases the attractiveness and persuasiveness of the repugnant conclusion is a question we would like to pass on to philosophy and ethics.</description>
