      <title>Confidence regions for a persistence diagram of a single image with one or more loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) uses persistent homology to quantify loops and higher-dimensional holes in data, making it particularly relevant for examining the characteristics of images of cells in the field of cell biology. In the context of a cell injury, as time progresses, a wound in the form of a ring emerges in the cell image and then gradually vanishes. Performing statistical inference on this ring-like pattern in a single image is challenging due to the absence of repeated samples. In this paper, we develop a novel framework leveraging TDA to estimate underlying structures within individual images and quantify associated uncertainties through confidence regions. Our proposed method partitions the image into the background and the damaged cell regions. Then pixels within the affected cell region are used to establish confidence regions in the space of persistence diagrams (topological summary statistics). The method establishes estimates on the persistence diagrams which correct the bias of traditional TDA approaches. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the coverage probabilities of the proposed confidence regions in comparison to an alternative approach is proposed in this paper. We also illustrate our methodology by a real-world example provided by cell repair.</description>

      <title>Minimax Regret Learning for Data with Heterogeneous Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern complex datasets often consist of various sub-populations. To develop robust and generalizable methods in the presence of sub-population heterogeneity, it is important to guarantee a uniform learning performance instead of an average one. In many applications, prior information is often available on which sub-population or group the data points belong to. Given the observed groups of data, we develop a min-max-regret (MMR) learning framework for general supervised learning, which targets to minimize the worst-group regret. Motivated from the regret-based decision theoretic framework, the proposed MMR is distinguished from the value-based or risk-based robust learning methods in the existing literature. The regret criterion features several robustness and invariance properties simultaneously. In terms of generalizability, we develop the theoretical guarantee for the worst-case regret over a super-population of the meta data, which incorporates the observed sub-populations, their mixtures, as well as other unseen sub-populations that could be approximated by the observed ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulation studies and an application to kidney transplantation data from hundreds of transplant centers.</description>

      <title>Efficient spline orthogonal basis for representation of density functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probability density functions form a specific class of functional data objects with intrinsic properties of scale invariance and relative scale characterized by the unit integral constraint. The Bayes spaces methodology respects their specific nature, and the centred log-ratio transformation enables processing such functional data in the standard Lebesgue space of square-integrable functions. As the data representing densities are frequently observed in their discrete form, the focus has been on their spline representation. Therefore, the crucial step in the approximation is to construct a proper spline basis reflecting their specific properties. Since the centred log-ratio transformation forms a subspace of functions with a zero integral constraint, the standard $B$-spline basis is no longer suitable. Recently, a new spline basis incorporating this zero integral property, called $Z\!B$-splines, was developed. However, this basis does not possess the orthogonal property which is beneficial from computational and application point of view. As a result of this paper, we describe an efficient method for constructing an orthogonal $Z\!B$-splines basis, called $Z\!B$-splinets. The advantages of the $Z\!B$-splinet approach are foremost a computational efficiency and locality of basis supports that is desirable for data interpretability, e.g. in the context of functional principal component analysis. The proposed approach is demonstrated on an empirical demographic dataset.</description>

      <title>Predictive Decision Synthesis for Portfolios: Betting on Better Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss and develop Bayesian dynamic modelling and predictive decision synthesis for portfolio analysis. The context involves model uncertainty with a set of candidate models for financial time series with main foci in sequential learning, forecasting, and recursive decisions for portfolio reinvestments. The foundational perspective of Bayesian predictive decision synthesis (BPDS) defines novel, operational analysis and resulting predictive and decision outcomes. A detailed case study of BPDS in financial forecasting of international exchange rate time series and portfolio rebalancing, with resulting BPDS-based decision outcomes compared to traditional Bayesian analysis, exemplifies and highlights the practical advances achievable under the expanded, subjective Bayesian approach that BPDS defines.</description>

      <title>Unifying and extending Precision Recall metrics for assessing generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the evaluation of generative models has gained a lot of attention. Whereas most generative models are compared in terms of scalar values such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) or Inception Score (IS), in the last years (Sajjadi et al., 2018) proposed a definition of precision-recall curve to characterize the closeness of two distributions. Since then, various approaches to precision and recall have seen the light (Kynkaanniemi et al., 2019; Naeem et al., 2020; Park &amp; Kim, 2023). They center their attention on the extreme values of precision and recall, but apart from this fact, their ties are elusive. In this paper, we unify most of these approaches under the same umbrella, relying on the work of (Simon et al., 2019). Doing so, we were able not only to recover entire curves, but also to expose the sources of the accounted pitfalls of the concerned metrics. We also provide consistency results that go well beyond the ones presented in the corresponding literature. Last, we study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally.</description>

      <title>ALCM: Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To perform effective causal inference in high-dimensional datasets, initiating the process with causal discovery is imperative, wherein a causal graph is generated based on observational data. However, obtaining a complete and accurate causal graph poses a formidable challenge, recognized as an NP-hard problem. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era, indicating their emergent capabilities and widespread applicability in facilitating causal reasoning across diverse domains, such as medicine, finance, and science. The expansive knowledge base of LLMs holds the potential to elevate the field of causal reasoning by offering interpretability, making inferences, generalizability, and uncovering novel causal structures. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, named Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework (ALCM), to synergize data-driven causal discovery algorithms and LLMs, automating the generation of a more resilient, accurate, and explicable causal graph. The ALCM consists of three integral components: causal structure learning, causal wrapper, and LLM-driven causal refiner. These components autonomously collaborate within a dynamic environment to address causal discovery questions and deliver plausible causal graphs. We evaluate the ALCM framework by implementing two demonstrations on seven well-known datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ALCM outperforms existing LLM methods and conventional data-driven causal reasoning mechanisms. This study not only shows the effectiveness of the ALCM but also underscores new research directions in leveraging the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Testing for an Explosive Bubble using High-Frequency Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a continuous-time stochastic volatility model with a linear drift, we develop a test for explosive behavior in financial asset prices at a low frequency when prices are sampled at a higher frequency. The test exploits the volatility information in the high-frequency data. The method consists of devolatizing log-asset price increments with realized volatility measures and performing a supremum-type recursive Dickey-Fuller test on the devolatized sample. The proposed test has a nuisance-parameter-free asymptotic distribution and is easy to implement. We study the size and power properties of the test in Monte Carlo simulations. A real-time date-stamping strategy based on the devolatized sample is proposed for the origination and conclusion dates of the explosive regime. Conditions under which the real-time date-stamping strategy is consistent are established. The test and the date-stamping strategy are applied to study explosive behavior in cryptocurrency and stock markets.</description>

      <title>Fair Risk Control: A Generalized Framework for Calibrating Multi-group Fairness Risks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for post-processing machine learning models so that their predictions satisfy multi-group fairness guarantees. Based on the celebrated notion of multicalibration, we introduce $(\mathbf{s},\mathcal{G}, \alpha)-$GMC (Generalized Multi-Dimensional Multicalibration) for multi-dimensional mappings $\mathbf{s}$, constraint set $\mathcal{G}$, and a pre-specified threshold level $\alpha$. We propose associated algorithms to achieve this notion in general settings. This framework is then applied to diverse scenarios encompassing different fairness concerns, including false negative rate control in image segmentation, prediction set conditional uncertainty quantification in hierarchical classification, and de-biased text generation in language models. We conduct numerical studies on several datasets and tasks.</description>

      <title>Handling missing data when estimating causal effects with Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) is increasingly used for doubly robust causal inference, but how missing data should be handled when using TMLE with data-adaptive approaches is unclear. Based on the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate eight missing data methods in this context: complete-case analysis, extended TMLE incorporating outcome-missingness model, missing covariate missing indicator method, five multiple imputation (MI) approaches using parametric or machine-learning models. Six scenarios were considered, varying in exposure/outcome generation models (presence of confounder-confounder interactions) and missingness mechanisms (whether outcome influenced missingness in other variables and presence of interaction/non-linear terms in missingness models). Complete-case analysis and extended TMLE had small biases when outcome did not influence missingness in other variables. Parametric MI without interactions had large bias when exposure/outcome generation models included interactions. Parametric MI including interactions performed best in bias and variance reduction across all settings, except when missingness models included a non-linear term. When choosing a method to handle missing data in the context of TMLE, researchers must consider the missingness mechanism and, for MI, compatibility with the analysis method. In many settings, a parametric MI approach that incorporates interactions and non-linearities is expected to perform well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While powerful methods have been developed for high-dimensional hypothesis testing assuming orthogonal parameters, current approaches struggle to generalize to the more common non-orthogonal case. We propose Stable Distillation (SD), a simple paradigm for iteratively extracting independent pieces of information from observed data, assuming a parametric model. When applied to hypothesis testing for large regression models, SD orthogonalizes the effect estimates of non-orthogonal predictors by judiciously introducing noise into the observed outcomes vector, yielding mutually independent p-values across predictors. Simulations and a real regression example using US campaign contributions show that SD yields a scalable approach for non-orthogonal designs that exceeds or matches the power of existing methods against sparse alternatives. While we only present explicit SD algorithms for hypothesis testing in ordinary least squares and logistic regression, we provide general guidance for deriving and improving the power of SD procedures.</description>

      <title>A geometric power analysis for general log-linear models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Log-linear models are widely used to express the association in multivariate frequency data on contingency tables. The paper focuses on the power analysis for testing the goodness-of-fit hypothesis for this model type. Conventionally, for the power-related sample size calculations a deviation from the null hypothesis (effect size) is specified by means of the chi-square goodness-of-fit index. It is argued that the odds ratio is a more natural measure of effect size, with the advantage of having a data-relevant interpretation. Therefore, a class of log-affine models that are specified by odds ratios whose values deviate from those of the null by a small amount can be chosen as an alternative. Being expressed as sets of constraints on odds ratios, both hypotheses are represented by smooth surfaces in the probability simplex, and thus, the power analysis can be given a geometric interpretation as well. A concept of geometric power is introduced and a Monte-Carlo algorithm for its estimation is proposed. The framework is applied to the power analysis of goodness-of-fit in the context of multinomial sampling. An iterative scaling procedure for generating distributions from a log-affine model is described and its convergence is proved. To illustrate, the geometric power analysis is carried out for data from a clinical study.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric classification with missing data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new nonparametric framework for classification problems in the presence of missing data. The key aspect of our framework is that the regression function decomposes into an anova-type sum of orthogonal functions, of which some (or even many) may be zero. Working under a general missingness setting, which allows features to be missing not at random, our main goal is to derive the minimax rate for the excess risk in this problem. In addition to the decomposition property, the rate depends on parameters that control the tail behaviour of the marginal feature distributions, the smoothness of the regression function and a margin condition. The ambient data dimension does not appear in the minimax rate, which can therefore be faster than in the classical nonparametric setting. We further propose a new method, called the Hard-thresholding Anova Missing data (HAM) classifier, based on a careful combination of a k-nearest neighbour algorithm and a thresholding step. The HAM classifier attains the minimax rate up to polylogarithmic factors and numerical experiments further illustrate its utility.</description>

      <title>Causal Effects in Matching Mechanisms with Strategically Reported Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing number of central authorities use assignment mechanisms to allocate students to schools in a way that reflects student preferences and school priorities. However, most real-world mechanisms incentivize students to strategically misreport their preferences. In this paper, we provide an approach for identifying the causal effects of school assignment on future outcomes that accounts for strategic misreporting. Misreporting may invalidate existing point-identification approaches, and we derive sharp bounds for causal effects that are robust to strategic behavior. Our approach applies to any mechanism as long as there exist placement scores and cutoffs that characterize that mechanism's allocation rule. We use data from a deferred acceptance mechanism that assigns students to more than 1,000 university-major combinations in Chile. Matching theory predicts that students' behavior in Chile should be strategic because they can list only up to eight options, and we find empirical evidence consistent with such behavior. Our bounds are informative enough to reveal significant heterogeneity in graduation success with respect to preferences and school assignment.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery Under Local Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is a widely adopted framework designed to safeguard the sensitive information of data providers within a data set. It is based on the application of controlled noise at the interface between the server that stores and processes the data, and the data consumers. Local differential privacy is a variant that allows data providers to apply the privatization mechanism themselves on their data individually. Therefore it provides protection also in contexts in which the server, or even the data collector, cannot be trusted. The introduction of noise, however, inevitably affects the utility of the data, particularly by distorting the correlations between individual data components. This distortion can prove detrimental to tasks such as causal discovery. In this paper, we consider various well-known locally differentially private mechanisms and compare the trade-off between the privacy they provide, and the accuracy of the causal structure produced by algorithms for causal learning when applied to data obfuscated by these mechanisms. Our analysis yields valuable insights for selecting appropriate local differentially private protocols for causal discovery tasks. We foresee that our findings will aid researchers and practitioners in conducting locally private causal discovery.</description>
