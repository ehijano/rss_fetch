      <description>arXiv:2503.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a block gradient ascent method for solving the quantum optimal transport problem with entropic regularisation similar to the algorithm proposed in [D. Feliciangeli, A. Gerolin, L. Portinale: J. Funct. Anal. 285 (2023), no. 4, 109963] and [E. Caputo, A. Gerolin, N. Monina, L. Portinale: arXiv:2409.03698]. We prove a linear convergence rate based on strong concavity of the dual functional and present some results of numerical experiments of an implementation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behaviour of Solutions to the Fokker-Planck Equation: Naval Dynamics Under Stochastic Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic dynamics of solutions to the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation, with a specific focus on ship roll stability in dynamic sea conditions. Utilizing a fourth-order filter, we conduct a thorough analysis of the time evolution of the probability distributions for roll angles, roll speeds, and roll excitations. Our theoretical framework provides new insights into the long-term behavior of these systems, emphasizing the role of stochastic perturbations. Key findings reveal that the probability of capsizing remains constant over time, offering significant contributions to the stability assessment of maritime vessels under uncertain environmental conditions. This work paves the way for more robust models in maritime engineering and dynamic stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Are Pseudo-Hermiticity and Generalized $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-Symmetry Equivalent at Exceptional Points?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $\mathcal{X}:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[\mathcal{X},H]=0$ and $\mathcal{X}^2=1$. We show that this equivalence is generally valid for block-diagonalizable operators, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. In particular, we establish the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry for arbitrary linear operators acting in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and extend results by Ueltschi [19] on the application of reflection positivity to loop models with $\theta \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$. By exploiting additional flexibility in the method, we prove the existence of long loops over a broader range of parameters $u$ and $\theta$, and establish new lower bounds for connection probabilities and the critical parameter $\beta_c$. Our results are compared with recent numerical simulations, providing further insight into the phase diagram of quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Relative Positions of Half-sided Modular Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_1 \subset H$ and $K_2 \subset H$ be half-sided modular inclusions in a common standard subspace $H$. We prove that the inclusion $K_1 \subset K_2$ holds if and only if we have an inclusion of spectral subspaces of the generators of the positive one-parameter groups associated to the half-sided modular inclusions $K_1 \subset H$ and $K_2 \subset H$. From this we give a characterization of this situation in terms of (operator valued) symmetric inner functions. We illustrate these characterizations with some examples of non-trivial phenomena occurring in this setting.</description>

      <title>Q-operators for the Ruijsenaars model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Ruijsenaars model admits a one-parameter commuting family of Q-operators. The commutativity is equivalent to an elliptic hypergeometric integral transformation that was conjectured by Gadde et al., and has an alternative interpretation in terms of S-duality for quiver gauge theories. We present two proofs of this conjecture, one using the elliptic Macdonald polynomials of Langmann et al., and one using known results on elliptic hypergeometric integrals. We also explain how the Noumi-Sano operators appear as degenerations of Q-operators.</description>

      <title>Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,1)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Inverse source problems for a multidimensional time-fractional wave equation with integral overdetermination conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two linear inverse problems for the time-fractional wave equation, assuming that its right-hand side takes the separable form $f(t)h(x)$, where $t \geq 0$ and $x \in \Omega \subset R^N $. The objective is to determine the unknown function $f(t)$ (Inverse Problem 1) and $h(x)$ (Inverse Problem 2), given that the other function is known.
  For Inverse Problem 1, we impose an overdetermination condition in the form of a spatial integral over the domain $\Omega $, involving the solution of the corresponding direct problem an initial-boundary value problem with standard Cauchy conditions and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The integral is weighted by the known spatial factor h(x) from the right-hand side of the equation. This choice of an additional condition enables the explicit construction of a solution to the inverse problem and allows us to prove its unique solvability within the class of regular solutions. To study the direct problem, the regular solution approach is used.
  For Inverse Problem 2, we introduce a novel integral-type additional condition, referred to as the time-averaged velocity, incorporating an appropriate weight function. The time-dependent factor of the right-hand side of the equation serves as this weight function. Depending on its choice, the additional condition reduces to specifying either the final-time offset or the time-averaged offset. Under this formulation, we establish a new uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>On the inverse elastic problem for isotropic media using Eshelby and Lippmann-Schwinger integral formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two applications of the integro-differential volume equation for the eigenstrain, building on Eshelby's inclusion method [15,16], in the contexts of both static and dynamic linear elasticity. The primary objective is to address the inverse problem of recovering the elastic moduli of the inhomogeneity using a limited number of incident fields. In the static case, we adopt an efficient reformulation of Eshelby's equation proposed by Bonnet [7]. By employing a first-order approximation in addition with a limited number of incident loadings and measurements, we numerically determine the material coefficients of the inclusion. In elastodynamics, we focus on the inverse scattering problem, utilizing the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation to reconstruct the elastic properties of the inclusion through a Newton-type iterative scheme. We construct the Frechet derivative and we formulate the linearized far-field equation. Additionally, the corresponding plane strain problems are analyzed in both static and dynamic elasticity.</description>

      <title>A Closed Form for Moment-Based Entanglement Tests Associated to the PPT Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neven et al. have explored an unexpected alliance between the mathematical insights of Sir Isaac Newton and Ren\'e Descartes which culminates in the reduction of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) criterion to an equivalent hierarchy of entanglement tests based on the moments of the partial transpose. By repurposing these classical results in the context of modern quantum theory, they illuminate new pathways for entanglement verification. Here, we expand on this work by providing a closed form for the inequalities defining these entanglement tests and producing an equivalent set of graph theoretic conditions on the weighted graph induced by the partial transpose.</description>

      <title>Random cluster models on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On locally tree-like random graphs, we relate the random cluster model with external magnetic fields and $q\geq 2$ to Ising models with vertex-dependent external fields. The fact that one can formulate general random cluster models in terms of two-spin ferromagnetic Ising models is quite interesting in its own right. However, in the general setting, the external fields are both positive and negative, which is mathematically unexplored territory. Interestingly, due to the reformulation as a two-spin model, we can show that the Bethe partition function, which is believed to have the same pressure per particle, is always a {\em lower bound} on the graph pressure per particle. We further investigate special cases in which the external fields do always have the same sign.
  The first example is the Potts model with general external fields on random $d$-regular graphs. In this case, we show that the pressure per particle in the quenched setting agrees with that of the annealed setting, and verify \cite[Assumption 1.4]{BasDemSly23}. We show that there is a line of values for the external fields where the model displays a first-order phase transition. This completes the identification of the phase diagram of the Potts model on the random $d$-regular graph. As a second example, we consider the high external field and low temperature phases of the system on locally tree-like graphs with general degree distribution.</description>

      <title>Higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants from projective bundles on smooth log Calabi-Yau pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,E)$ be a smooth log Calabi-Yau pair consisting of a smooth Fano surface $X$ and a smooth anticanonical divisor $E$. We obtain certain higher genus local Gromov-Witten invariants from the projectivization of the canonical bundle $Z := \mathbb{P}(K_X \oplus \mathcal{O}_X)$, using the degeneration formula for stable log maps [KLR]. We evaluate an invariant in the degeneration using the relationship between $q$-refined tropical curve counting and logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory with $\lambda_g$-insertion [Bou]. As a corollary, we use flops to prove a blow up formula for higher genus invariants of $Z$. Additionally assuming $X$ is toric, we prove an all genera correspondence between open invariants of an outer Aganagic-Vafa brane $L \subset K_X$ and closed invariants of $Z$ using the Topological Vertex [AKMV] and an argument in [GRZZ], that generalizes a genus-0 open-closed equality of [Cha] to all genera.</description>

      <title>Gauge preservation in renormalization for Yang-Mills and gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

      <title>Analysis of pitchfork bifurcations and symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unified framework is proposed to quantitatively characterize pitchfork bifurcations and associated symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). It is known that planar/vertical Lyapunov orbits and Lissajous orbits near the collinear libration points undergo pitchfork bifurcations with varying orbital energy. These bifurcations induce symmetry breaking, generating bifurcated families including halo/quasi-halo orbits, axial/quasi-axial orbits, and their corresponding invariant manifolds. Traditional semi-analytical methods for constructing halo orbits, based on resonant bifurcation mechanisms, have obstacles in fully exploiting the intrinsic symmetry breaking characteristics in pitchfork bifurcations. In this paper, we propose a unified trigonometric series-based framework to analyze these bifurcated families from the perspective of coupling-induced bifurcation mechanisms. By introducing a coupling coefficient and various bifurcation equations into the ERTBP, different symmetry breaking is achieved when the coupling coefficient is non-zero. This unified semi-analytical framework captures bifurcations of both periodic/quasi-periodic and transit/non-transit orbits. Furthermore, it reveals that pitchfork bifurcation solutions in the ERTBP fundamentally depend solely on the orbital eccentricity and three amplitude parameters of the system's degrees of freedom, governing both the elliptic direction and the hyperbolic one.</description>

      <title>On the Topological Nature of the Butterfly Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, also known as dynamical chaos, is a strongly nonlinear qualitative phenomenon. Its most promising theoretical descriptions are likely to emerge from non-perturbative approaches, with symmetry-based methods being particularly reliable. One such symmetry-based framework is supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS). STS reformulates a general form stochastic (partial) differential equations (SDE) as a cohomological topological field theory (TFT) and identifies the order associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the corresponding topological supersymmetry (TS) as the stochastic generalization of chaos. The Faddeev-Popov ghosts of STS act as a systematic bookkeeping tool for the dynamic differentials from the definition of the butterfly effect (BE): the infinitely long dynamical memory unique to chaos. Accordingly, the effective field theory (EFT) of the TS breaking is essentially a field theory of the BE in the long-wavelength limit. Building on this perspective, here we demonstrate that one way to build such EFTs is the background field method with the external $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ supergauge field coupled to N=2 supercurrents of STS, the fermion number conservation, and translations in time. By the Goldstone theorem, the resulting EFTs are conformal field theories (CFTs) and the operator product expansion provides an explanation for 1/f noise -- the experimental signature of chaos in the form of dynamical power-law correlations. Moreover, the generating functional of the background field possesses its own TS, revealing the topological nature of the BE. Particularly, when the Anti-de Sitter(AdS)/CFT correspondence is an acceptable approximation, the holographic dual of EFT is a cohomological TFT on AdS in which the associated TS and the isometry of the basespace underlie the BE and 1/f noise, respectively.</description>

      <title>Small-scale turbulence limit of Fokker-Planck equation for polymers in turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the singular limit of Fokker-Planck equation of polymers density as the dominant time-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero. Here, we complete the study of Flandoli-Tahraoui[arXiv:2410.00520] about scaling limit as the space-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero by using stochastic modeling of turbulence. Depending on certain parameters related to turbulence modeling, the limit density has generalized Cauchy distribution for the end-to-end vector. We discuss also the limit when we don't have a probability density limit. Our approach is based on the derivation of an appropriate estimates on $L^2$ with appropriate weight and investigate the convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we will develop linear and nonlinear filtering methods for a large class of nonlinear wave equations that arise in applications such as quantum dynamics and laser generation and propagation in a unified framework. We consider both stochastic calculus and white noise filtering methods and derive measure-valued evolution equations for the nonlinear filter and prove existence and uniqueness theorems for the solutions. We will also study first order approximations to these measure-valued evolutions by linearizing the wave equations and characterize the filter dynamics in terms of infinite dimensional operator Riccati equations and establish solvability theorems.</description>

      <title>The probability of almost all eigenvalues being real for the elliptic real Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the asymmetric parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form $$\begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &amp;\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &amp;\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*}$$ and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>A non-degeneracy theorem for interacting electrons in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state of many-body Schr\"odinger operators for electrons in one dimension is non-degenerate. More precisely, we consider Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a large class of distributions. In this setting, we show that the ground-state of the system with Fermi statistics and local boundary conditions is non-degenerate and does not vanish on a set of positive measure. In the case of periodic and anti-periodic (or more general non-local) boundary conditions, we show that the same result holds whenever the number of particles is odd and even, respectively. This non-degeneracy result seems to be new even for regular potentials $v$ and $w$. As an immediate application of this result, we prove eigenvalue inequalities and the strong unique continuation property for eigenfunctions of the single-particle one-dimensional operators $h(v) = -\Delta +v$. In addition, we prove strict inequalities between the lowest eigenvalues of different self-adjoint realizations of $H_N(v,w)$.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness and convergence of higher-order Hartree equations in critical Sobolev spaces on $\mathbb{T}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Hartree equations generalised to $2p+1$ order nonlinearities. These equations arise in the study of the mean-field limits of Bose gases with $p$-body interactions. We study their well-posedness properties in $H^{s_c}(\mathbb{T}^3)$, where $\mathbb{T}^3$ is the three dimensional torus and $s_c = 3/2 - 1/p$ is the scaling-critical regularity. The convergence of solutions of the Hartree equation to solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is proved. We also consider the case of mixed nonlinearities, proving local well-posedness in $s_c$ by considering the problem as a perturbation of the higher-order Hartree equation. In the particular case of the (defocusing) quintic-cubic Hartree equation, we also prove global well-posedness for all initial conditions in $H^1(\mathbb{T}^3)$. This is done by viewing it as a perturbation of the local quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Linear statistics at the microscopic scale for the 2D Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical Coulomb gas in two dimensions at the inverse temperature $\beta=2$, confined within a droplet of radius $R$ by a rotationally invariant potential $U(r)$. For $U(r)\sim r^2$ this describes the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre ensemble of random matrices. We study linear statistics of the form ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(|{\bf x}_i|)$, where ${\bf x}_i$'s are the positions of the $N$ particles, in the large $N$ limit with $R=O(1)$. It is known that for smooth functions $f(r)$ the variance ${\rm Var} \,{\cal L}_N= O(1)$, while for an indicator function relevant for the disk counting statistics, all cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 2$ behave as $\sim \sqrt{N}$. In addition, for smooth functions, it was shown that the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 3$ scale as $\sim N^{2-q}$. Surprisingly it was found that they depend only on $f'(|\bf x|)$ and its derivatives evaluated exactly at the boundary of the droplet. To understand this property, and interpolate between the two behaviors (smooth versus step-like), we study the microscopic linear statistics given by $f(r) \to f_N(r) = \phi((r-\hat r) \sqrt{N}/\xi)$, which probes the fluctuations at the scale of the inter-particle distance. We compute the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ at large $N$ for a fixed $\phi(u)$ at arbitrary $\xi$. For large $\xi$ they match the predictions for smooth functions which shows that the leading contribution in that case comes from a boundary layer of size $1/\sqrt{N}$ near the boundary of the droplet. Finally we show that the full probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$ take two distinct large deviation forms, in the regime ${\cal L}_N \sim \sqrt{N}$ and ${\cal L}_N \sim N$ respectively. We also discuss applications of our results to fermions in a rotating harmonic trap and to the Ginibre symplectic ensemble.</description>

      <title>An enhanced term in the Szeg\H{o}-type asymptotics for the free massless Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a regularised Fermi projection of the Hamiltonian of the massless Dirac equation at Fermi energy zero. The matrix-valued symbol of the resulting operator is discontinuous in the origin. For this operator, we prove Szeg\H{o}-type asymptotics with the spatial cut-off domains given by $d$-dimensional cubes. For analytic test functions, we obtain a $d$-term asymptotic expansion and provide an upper bound of logarithmic order for the remaining terms. This bound does not depend on the regularisation. In the special case that the test function is given by a polynomial of degree less or equal than three, we prove a $(d+1)$-term asymptotic expansion with an error term of constant order. The additional term is of logarithmic order and its coefficient is independent of the regularisation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the valence bond solid (VBS) state built of singlet pairs of fundamental representations and projected onto adjoint representations of the exceptional Lie group G$_2$. The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the VBS state, which constitutes the G$_2$ analog of the famous AKLT chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sphere-packing bound quantifies the error exponent for noisy channel coding for rates above a critical value. Here, we study the zero-rate limit of the sphere-packing bound and show that it has an intriguing single-letter form, which we call the umlaut information of the channel, inspired by the lautum information introduced by Palomar and Verd\'u. Unlike the latter quantity, we show that the umlaut information is additive for parallel uses of channels. We show that it has a twofold operational interpretation: as the zero-rate error exponent of non-signalling-assisted coding on the one hand, and as the zero-rate error exponent of list decoding in the large list limit on the other.</description>

      <title>Law of fractional logarithm for random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Paquette-Zeitouni law of fractional logarithm (LFL) for the extreme eigenvalues [arXiv:1505.05627] in full generality, and thereby verify a conjecture from [arXiv:1505.05627]. Our result holds for any Wigner minor process and both symmetry classes, in particular for the GOE minor process, while [arXiv:1505.05627] and the recent full resolution of LFL by Baslingker et.~al.~[arXiv:2410.11836] cover only the GUE case which is determinantal. Lacking the possibility for a direct comparison with the Gaussian case, we develop a robust and natural method for both key parts of the proof. On one hand, we rely on a powerful martingale technique to describe precisely the strong correlation between the largest eigenvalue of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix and its $(N-k)\times (N-k)$ minor if $k\ll N^{2/3}$. On the other hand, we use dynamical methods to show that this correlation is weak if $k\gg N^{2/3}$.</description>

The coefficients that answer this question are then connected to spin $J=N$ boson exchange amplitudes and perturbative unitarity constraints, deriving relations with Legendre polynomials and sum rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Near linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a locally unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_{\mathrm{H}}$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance. A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</description>

The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <title>Stability of the $\pi$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.</description>

      <title>The $q$-Racah polynomials from scalar products of Bethe states II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Leonard triples is applied to the derivation of normalized scalar products of on-shell and off-shell Bethe states generated from a Leonard pair. The scalar products take the form of linear combinations of $q$-Racah polynomials with coefficients depending on the off-shell parameters. Upon specializations, explicit solutions for the corresponding Belliard-Slavnov linear systems are obtained. It implies the existence of a determinant formula in terms of inhomogeneous Bethe roots for the $q$-Racah polynomials. Also, a set of relations that determines solutions (Bethe roots) of the corresponding Bethe equations of inhomogeneous type in terms of solutions of Bethe equations of homogenous type is obtained.</description>

      <title>Multispecies inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP from antisymmetric fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of Markov chain transition probabilities via quasi-stationarity -- an application to Bernoulli percolation on $C_k \times Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_n, n \ge 0$ be a Markov chain with finite state space $M$. If $x,y \in M$ such that $x$ is transient we have $P^y(X_n = x) \to 0$ for $n \to \infty$, and under mild aperiodicity conditions this convergence is monotone in that for some $N$ we have $\forall n \ge N: P^y(X_n = x)$ $\ge P^y(X_{n+1} = x)$. We use bounds on the rate of convergence of the Markov chain to its quasi-stationary distribution to obtain explicit bounds on $N$. We then apply this result to Bernoulli percolation with parameter $p$ on the cylinder graph $C_k \times Z$. Utilizing a Markov chain describing infection patterns layer per layer, we thus show the following uniform result on the monotonicity of connection probabilities: $\forall k \ge 3\, \forall n \ge 500k^6 2^k \,\forall p \in (0,1) \, \forall m \in C_k\!\!:$ $P_p((0,0) \leftrightarrow (m,n)) \ge P_p((0,0) \leftrightarrow (m,n+1))$. In general these kind of monotonicity properties of connection probabilities are difficult to establish and there are only few pertaining results.</description>

      <title>Random tangled currents for $\varphi^4$: translation invariant Gibbs measures and continuity of the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of automorphism invariant Gibbs measures for the $\varphi^4$ model on graphs of polynomial growth has at most two extremal measures at all values of $\beta$. We also give a sufficient condition to ensure that the set of all Gibbs measures is a singleton. As an application, we show that the spontaneous magnetisation of the nearest-neighbour $\varphi^4$ model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ vanishes at criticality for $d\geq 3$. The analogous results were established for the Ising model in the seminal works of Aizenman, Duminil-Copin, and Sidoravicius (Comm. Math. Phys., 2015), and Raoufi (Ann. Prob., 2020) using the so-called random current representation introduced by Aizenman (Comm. Math. Phys., 1982). One of the main contributions of this paper is the development of a corresponding geometric representation for the $\varphi^4$ model called the random tangled current representation.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</description>

      <title>Quantum Trajectories. Spectral Gap, Quasi-compactness &amp; Limit Theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories are Markov processes modeling the evolution of a quantum system subjected to repeated independent measurements. Inspired by the theory of random products of matrices, it has been shown that these Markov processes admit a unique invariant measure under a purification and an irreducibility assumptions. This paper is devoted to the spectral study of the underlying Markov operator. Using Quasi-compactness, it is shown that this operator admits a spectral gap and the peripheral spectrum is described in a precise manner. Next two perturbations of this operator are studied. This allows to derive limit theorems (Central Limit Theorem, Berry-Esseen bounds and Large Deviation Principle) for the empirical mean of functions of the Markov chain as well as the Lyapounov exponent of the underlying random dynamical system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct new families of supersymmetric AdS$_2\times\mathbb{M}_4$ solutions of $D=6$ gauged supergravity and AdS$_3\times\mathbb{M}_4$ solutions of $D=7$ gauged supergravity, where $\mathbb{M}_4$ are four-dimensional toric orbifolds with four fixed points. These are presented in a unified fashion, that highlights their common underlying geometry. The $D=6$ solutions uplift to massive type IIA and describe the near-horizon limit of D4-branes wrapped on $\mathbb{M}_4$, while the $D=7$ solutions uplift to $D=11$ supergravity and describe the near-horizon limit of M5-branes wrapped on $\mathbb{M}_4$. We reproduce the entropy and gravitational central charge of the two families by extremizing a function constructed gluing the orbifold gravitational blocks proposed in arXiv:2210.16128.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic runtime advantage for all computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An enduring challenge in computer science is reducing the runtime required to solve computational problems. Quantum computing has attracted significant attention due to its potential to deliver asymptotically faster solutions to certain problems compared to the best-known classical algorithms. This advantage is enabled by the quantum mechanical nature of the logical degrees of freedom. To date, it was unknown if permitting other parts of the computer to be quantum mechanical, rather than semi-classical, could yield additional runtime speed-ups as a function of resource utilization (e.g., power consumption or cooling requirements).
  In this work, we prove that when the control mechanisms associated with gate implementation are optimal quantum mechanical states, a quadratic runtime speedup (with respect to power consumption) is achievable for any algorithm, relative to optimal classical or semi-classical control schemes. Moreover, we demonstrate that only a small fraction of the computer's architecture needs to employ optimal quantum control states to realize this advantage, thereby significantly simplifying the design of future systems.
  We call this new device a quantum frequential computer, since the quantum speedup arises from an increase in gate frequency. In current state-of-the-art designs, gate frequency is often limited by the coupling strength between components. Notably, our approach achieves the speedup without requiring an increase in coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

Abstract: We consider a plasma that is created by a high voltage difference $\lambda$, which is known as a Townsend discharge. We consider it to be confined to the region $\Omega$ between two concentric spheres, two concentric cylinders, or more generally between two star-shaped surfaces. We first prove that if the plasma is initially relatively dilute, then either it may remain dilute for all time or it may not, depending on a certain parameter $\kappa(\lambda, \Omega)$. Secondly, we prove that there is a connected one-parameter family of steady states. This family connects the non-ionized gas to a plasma, either with a sparking voltage $\lambda^*$ or with very high ionization, at least in the cylindrical or spherical cases.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry Amplification by a Nonadiabatic Passage through a Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and solve a minimal model of dynamic passage through a second-order phase transition in the presence of symmetry breaking interactions and no dissipation. Our model generalizes the Hamiltonian dynamics of the Painleve'-2 equation to the case with many degrees of freedom, while maintaining the integrability property. The evolution eventually leads to a highly asymmetric state, no matter how weak the symmetry breaking parameter of the Hamiltonian is. This suggests a potential mechanism for strong asymmetry in the production of quasi-particles with nearly identical characteristics. The model's integrability also yields exact exponents for the scaling of the density of the nonadiabatically excited quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras III: Donaldson--Thomas $qq$-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We further develop the BPS/CFT correspondence between quiver W-algebras/$qq$-characters and partition functions of gauge origami. We introduce $qq$-characters associated with multi-dimensional partitions with nontrivial boundary conditions which we call Donaldson--Thomas (DT) $qq$-characters. They are operator versions of the equivariant DT vertices of toric Calabi--Yau three and four-folds. Moreover, we revisit the construction of the D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions and give a quantum algebraic derivation of the sign rules of the magnificent four partition function. We also show that under the proper sign rules, the D6 and D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions all commute with each other and discuss its physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty principles on $C^{*}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove some uncertainty bounds for commutators and anti-commutators of observables in a $C^*$-algebra. We give a short, elementary proof of Robertson's Standard Uncertaity Principle in this setting. We also prove some other uncertainty relations for which the lower bound doesn't vanish for any number of observables.</description>

      <title>Constraining all possible Korteweg-de Vries type hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current $j=\partial_-\phi$ in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. The infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras define integrable deformations of the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory which preserve the Poisson bracket structure. We study these mutually commuting subalgebras, finding general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. Along the way, we derive constraints on integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>
