      <title>Superconductivity on the edge of vanishing magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There should be no question that magnetism and superconductivity appear in close proximity in many if not most of the unconventional superconductors. These two phases are importantly correlated: the strongest manifestations of this superconducting pairing are generally associated with the weakest magnetism. It is often stated that this behavior results from a quantum critical point (QCP), although not all such superconductors fit into this category. In this paper we consider a second scenario for addressing these proximity phenomena in which no QCP is present. Although there are other examples for this latter category, most notable are those associated with very strongly paired superconductors that have insulating and magnetically ordered ``parent" materials. Here, too, one finds that ``failed" long range order is key to establishing superconductivity. This leads to the general question, which is the focus of this paper. Why, and how, in either of these contexts, does this proximal magnetism play a constructive role in helping to stabilize superconductivity? Our understanding here should help pave the way towards the discovery of new families of superconductors, which are expected to emerge on the brink of magnetism.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetic order and spin-triplet pair generation in quantum critical d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supercurrent is well recognized as being of prime importance within mean-field theory, but remains largely unexplored in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) and the quantum critical region. To clarify the impact of the supercurrent on magnetism and superconductivity near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, we study the two-dimensional Hubbard model based on a fluctuation exchange approximation for a current-carrying superconducting state. We show a supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetism and emergence of spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The former results from Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, suppression in the superconducting gap, and strong correlation effects beyond the mean-field theory. Our results suggest that the supercurrent can bring out rich phenomena of superconductivity in SCES.</description>

      <title>Very strong coupling limit of Eliashberg-McMillan theory and the upper limit for superconducting transition temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19326v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief review of some recent work on the problem of highest achievable temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in electron-phonon systems. The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. We discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants. Finally we also briefly discuss some pessimistic estimates for $T_c$ of metallic hydrogen obtained in ``jellium'' model.</description>

      <title>Rare-earth atoms on Nb(110) as a platform to engineer topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helical spin textures in one-dimensional magnetic chains on superconductors can enable topological superconductivity and host Majorana zero modes, independent of the presence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that gadolinium (Gd) adatoms, possessing large 4f magnetic moments when placed on a Nb(110) surface, establish indirect exchange interactions mediated by valence electrons, manifesting as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy with density functional theory, we analyze the emergence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in single Gd atoms and Gd dimers and uncover the underlying magnetic interaction mechanisms, on the basis of which we predict by means of spin-dynamics simulations the formation of stable chiral N\'eel-type spin-spiral configurations in Gd chains. These findings highlight rare-earth magnets as a promising platform for precisely tuning spin-spiral ground states, an essential prerequisite for the realization of topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Orbital FFLO and layer-selective FFLO phases in trilayer NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-momentum superconductivity has become an important research topic in condensed matter physics. In particular, the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is stabi lized in atomically thin films by the orbital effect of an external magnetic field, has been getting attention as a fascinating finite-momentum superconducting state recently. We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We find an exotic superconducting phase, a layer-selective FFLO phase, in which finite-momentum Cooper pairs coexist with zero-momentum Cooper pairs, separated from the orbital FFLO phase.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration free models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple intra-unit-cell magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. Straight-forward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>

      <title>High spin, low spin or gapped spins: magnetism in the bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: III. Thermodynamic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.</description>

      <title>The electronic structure of a doped Mott-Hubbard surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sn/Si(111)-({\sqrt}3{\times}{\sqrt}3)R30{\deg} surface, a 2D Mott insulator, has long been predicted and then found experimetally to metallize and even turn superconducting upon boron doping. In order to clarify the structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered. These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further understanding of this fascinating system.</description>

      <title>Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a magnetic field parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor leads to a topological phase in coexistence with a single pair of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.</description>
