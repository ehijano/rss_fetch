      <title>Dirac Operators on Configuration Spaces: Fermions with Half-integer Spin, Real Structure, and Yang-Mills Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the development of a spectral triple-like construction on a configuration space of gauge connections. We have previously shown that key elements of bosonic and fermionic quantum field theory emerge from such a geometrical framework. In this paper we solve a central problem concerning the inclusion of fermions with half-integer spin into this framework. We map the tangent space of the configuration space into a similar space based on spinors and use this map to construct a Dirac operator on the configuration space. We also construct a real structure acting in a Hilbert space over the configuration space. Finally, we show that the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of the Hamiltonian of a non-perturbative quantum Yang-Mills theory emerge from a unitary transformation of a Dirac equation on a configuration space of gauge fields. The dual and anti-dual sectors emerge in a two-by-two matrix structure.</description>

      <title>Stability of Mesoscopic Fluctuations of Orthogonal Polynomial Ensembles Under Sparse Decaying Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of the mesoscopic fluctuations of certain orthogonal polynomial ensembles on the real line utilizing the recurrence relation of the associated orthogonal polynomials. We prove that under a sparse enough decaying perturbation of the recurrence coefficients the limiting distribution is stable. As a corollary we prove a mesoscopic central limit theorem (at any scale) for a family of singular continuous measures on $[-2,2]$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and invariance algebras of the $d$-dimensional Dunkl-Coulomb problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the rich algebraic structure of the standard $d$-dimensional Coulomb problem can be extended to its Dunkl counterpart. Replacing standard derivatives by Dunkl ones in the so($d+1$,2) dynamical algebra generators of the former gives rise to a deformed algebra with similar commutation relations, except that the metric tensor becomes dependent on the reflection operators and that there are some additional commutation or anticommutation relations involving the latter. It is then shown that from some of the dynamical algebra generators it is straightforward to derive the integrals of motion of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Sturm representation. Finally, from the latter, the components of a deformed Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector are built. Together with the Dunkl angular momentum components, such operators insure the superintegrability of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Schr\"odinger representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two Hamiltonians that are close to each other, $H_1 \approx H_2 $, and analyze the time-decay of the corresponding Loschmidt echo $\mathfrak{M}(t) := |\langle \psi_0, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} t H_2} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} t H_1} \psi_0 \rangle|^2$ that expresses the effect of an imperfect time reversal on the initial state $\psi_0$. Our model Hamiltonians are deformed Wigner matrices that do not share a common eigenbasis. The main tools for our results are two-resolvent laws for such $H_1$ and $H_2$.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for some dissipative systems from the Jacobi last multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describing conservative systems naturally preserves the standard notion of phase-space volume, a result known as the Liouville's theorem which is central to the formulation of classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for invariant phase-space measures for certain dissipative systems, namely, systems described by conformal vector fields on symplectic manifolds that are cotangent bundles, contact Hamiltonian systems, and systems of the Li\'enard class with position-dependent damping. The latter class of systems can be described by certain generalized conformal vector fields on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The computation of the invariant measures is achieved by calculating the Jacobi last multiplier for the above-mentioned dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Local superconformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a supermanifold equipped with an odd distribution of maximal dimension and constant symbol, we construct the formal moduli problem of deformations of the distribution. This moduli problem is described by a local super dg Lie algebra that provides both a resolution of the structure-preserving vector fields on superspace and a derived enhancement of superconformal symmetry. Applying our construction in standard physical examples returns the conformal supergravity multiplet in every known example, in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry$\unicode{x2014}$whether or not a superconformal algebra exists. We discuss new examples related to twisted supergravity, higher Virasoro algebras, and exceptional super Lie algebras. The compatibility of our techniques with twisting also leads to a computation of every twist of the stress tensor multiplet of a superconformal theory, including universal operator product expansions. Our approach uses a derived model for the space of functions constant along the distribution, which is applicable even when the distribution is non-involutive; we construct other natural multiplets, such as K\"ahler differentials, that appear naturally through this lens on superspace geometry.</description>

      <title>Horizon classification via Riemannian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Exact analytic toolbox for quantum dynamics with tunable noise strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that allows for the exact analytic treatment of quantum dynamics subject to coherent noise. The noise is modeled via unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian drawn from a random-matrix ensemble for arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension $N$. While the methods we develop apply to generic such ensembles with a notion of rotation invariance, we focus largely on the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Averaging over the ensemble of ''noisy'' Hamiltonians produces an effective quantum channel, the properties of which are analytically calculable and determined by the spectral form factors of the relevant ensemble. We compute spectral form factors of the GUE exactly for any finite $N$, along with the corresponding GUE quantum channel, and its variance. Key advantages of our approach include the ability to access exact analytic results for any $N$ and the ability to tune to the noise-free limit (in contrast, e.g., to the Haar ensemble), and analytic access to moments beyond the variance. We also highlight some unusual features of the GUE channel, including the nonmonotonicity of the coefficients of various operators as a function of noise strength and the failure to saturate the Haar-random limit, even with infinite noise strength.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string: the matrix integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a duality between the complex Liouville string and a two-matrix integral. The complex Liouville string is defined by coupling two Liouville theories with complex central charges $c = 13 \pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. The matrix integral is characterized by its spectral curve which allows us to compute the perturbative string amplitudes recursively via topological recursion. This duality constitutes a controllable instance of holographic duality. The leverage on the theory is provided by the rich analytic structure of the string amplitudes that we discussed in arXiv:2409.18759 and allows us to perform numerous tests on the duality.</description>

      <title>Wreath Macdonald polynomials, quiver varieties, and quasimap counts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knots that Never Come Untied</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin proposed that atoms form hydrodynamic vortex knots. However, they typically untie through reconnections, i. e., local cut-and-slice events, unlike stable vortex unknots such as smoke rings. The same holds in superfluids--quantum fluids with zero viscosity--where vortices have quantized circulation, making them topologically stable. For over 150 years, hydrodynamically stable vortex knots have been sought both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we present the first demonstration of hydrodynamically stable vortex knots and links in experimentally realizable Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atomic gases and confirm it through dynamic simulations. Our method creates stable knotted vortex structures in systems where reconnections are prohibited, with potential relevance to neutron star interiors. Additionally, we anticipate our mathematical framework could have applications in quantum computation, quantum turbulence, and DNA dynamics, particularly where reconnections are restricted.</description>

      <title>Moments of Characteristic Polynomials of Non-Symmetric Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the moments of the absolute characteristic polynomial of the real elliptic ensemble, including the case of the real Ginibre ensemble. We obtain asymptotics for all integral moments inside the real bulk to order 1 + o(1). In particular, for the real Ginibre ensemble, this extends known computations for even moments, and confirms a recent conjecture of Serebryakov and Simm [48] in the integral case. For the elliptic case, this generalizes computations of first two moments by Fyodorov [25] and Fyodorov and Tarnowski [31]. We additionally find uniform asymptotics for the multi-point correlations of the absolute characteristic polynomial. Our proof relies on a relation between expectations for the absolute characteristic polynomial and the real correlation functions, as well as an algebraic method of obtaining asymptotics for the behavior of these correlation functions near the diagonal.</description>

      <title>On the existence of traveling wave solutions for cold plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the existence of traveling wave solutions of the asymptotic model, derived by the authors in a previous work, to approximate the unidirectional evolution of a collision-free plasma in a magnetic field. First, using bifurcation theory, we can rigorously prove the existence of periodic traveling waves of small amplitude. Furthermore, our analysis also evidences the existence of different type of traveling waves. To this end, we present a second approach based on the analysis of the differential system satisfied by the traveling-wave profiles, the existence of equilibria, and the identification of associated homo-clinic and periodic orbits around them. The study makes use of linearization techniques and numerical computations to show the existence of different types of traveling-wave solutions, with monotone and non-monotone behaviour and different regularity, as well as periodic traveling waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use algebraic methods in statistical mechanics to represent a multi-parameter class of polynomials in severable variables as partition functions of a new family of solvable lattice models. The class of polynomials, defined by A.N. Kirillov, is derived from the largest class of divided difference operators satisfying the braid relations of Cartan type $A$. It includes as specializations Schubert, Grothendieck, and dual-Grothendieck polynomials among others. In particular, our results prove positivity conjectures of Kirillov for the subfamily of Hecke--Grothendieck polynomials, while the larger family is shown to exhibit rare instances of negative coefficients.</description>

This illustrates the situation beyond the so-called increasing propagation of chaos introduced by Ben Arous and Zeitouni 1999, where marginal distributions of size $k=o(N)$ are compared to product measures.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing in a hydrodynamic pilot--wave theory with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a stochastic hydrodynamic pilot-wave theory, which is a Langevin equation with a memory kernel that describes the dynamics of a walking droplet (or "walker") subjected to a repulsive singular potential and random perturbations through additive Gaussian noise. Under suitable assumptions on the singularities, we show that the walker dynamics is exponentially attracted toward the unique invariant probability measure. The proof relies on a combination of the Lyapunov technique and an asymptotic coupling specifically tailored to our setting. We also present examples of invariant measures, as obtained from numerical simulations of the walker in two-dimensional Coulomb potentials. Our results extend previous work on the ergodicity of stochastic pilot-wave dynamics established for smooth confining potentials.</description>

      <title>Elliptic domains in Lie groups</title>

Abstract: An element $g$ of a Lie group is called stably elliptic if it is contained in the interior of the set $G^e$ of elliptic elements, characterized by the property that $\mathrm{Ad}(g)$ generates a relatively compact subgroup. Stably elliptic elements appear naturally in the geometry of causal symmetric spaces and in representation theory. We characterize stably elliptic elements in terms of the fixed point algebra of $\mathrm{Ad}(g)$ and show that the connected components of the set $G^{se}$ of stably elliptic elements can be described in terms of the Weyl group action on a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra. In the case of simple hermitian Lie groups we relate stably elliptic elements to maximal invariant cones and the associated subsemigroups. In particular we show that the basic connected component $G^{se}(0)$ can be characterized in terms of the compactness of order intervals and that $G^{se}(0)$ is globally hyperbolic with respect to the induced biinvariant causal structure.</description>

Abstract: The central object of the quantum algebraic approach to the study of quantum integrable models is the universal $R$-matrix, which is an element of a completed tensor product of two copies of quantum algebra. Various integrability objects are constructed by choosing representations for the factors of this tensor product. There are two approaches to constructing explicit expressions for the universal $R$-matrix. One is based on the quantum double construction, and the other is based on the concept of the $q$-commutator. In the case of a quantum superalgebra, we cannot use the first approach, since we do not know an explicit expression for the Lusztig automorphisms. One can use the second approach, but it requires some modifications related to the presence of isotropic roots. In this article, we provide the necessary modification of the method and use it to find an $R$-operator for quantum integrable systems related to the quantum superalgebra $\mathrm U_q(\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{sl}_{M | N}))$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum mechanical systems with position dependent masses (PDM) admitting two parametric Lie symmetry groups are classified. Namely, all PDM systems are specified which, in addition to their invariance w.r.t. a two parametric Lie group, admit at least one second order integral of motion. The presented classification is partially extended to the more generic systems which do not accept any Lie group.</description>

Abstract: In the absence of external forcing, all trajectories on the phase plane of the van der Pol oscillator tend to a closed, periodic, trajectory -- the limit cycle -- after infinite time. Here, we drive the van der Pol oscillator with an external time-dependent force to reach the limit cycle in a given finite time. Specifically, we are interested in minimising the non-conservative contribution to the work when driving the system from a given initial point on the phase plane to any final point belonging to the limit cycle. There appears a speed limit inequality, which expresses a trade-off between the connection time and cost -- in terms of the non-conservative work. We show how the above results can be { generalized to the broader family of non-linear oscillators given by} the Li\'enard equation. Finally, we also look into the problem of minimising the total work done by the external force.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion by fractal homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $\alpha &lt; \frac13$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector field $\mathbf{b}(t,x)$ which is periodic in space and time and belongs to $C^0_t C^{\alpha}_x \cap C^{\alpha}_t C^0_x$ such that the corresponding scalar advection-diffusion equation $$\partial_t \theta^\kappa + \mathbf{b} \cdot \nabla \theta^\kappa - \kappa \Delta \theta^\kappa = 0$$ exhibits anomalous dissipation of scalar variance for arbitrary $H^1$ initial data: $$\limsup_{\kappa \to 0} \int_0^{1} \int_{\mathbb{T}^d} \kappa \| \nabla \theta^\kappa (t,x) \|^2 \,dx\,dt &gt;0.$$ The vector field is deterministic and has a fractal structure, with periodic shear flows alternating in time between different directions serving as the base fractal. These shear flows are repeatedly inserted at infinitely many scales in suitable Lagrangian coordinates. Using an argument based on ideas from quantitative homogenization, the corresponding advection-diffusion equation with small $\kappa$ is progressively renormalized, one scale at a time, starting from the (very small) length scale determined by the molecular diffusivity up to the macroscopic (unit) scale. At each renormalization step, the effective diffusivity is enhanced by the influence of advection on that scale. By iterating this procedure across many scales, the effective diffusivity on the macroscopic scale is shown to be of order one.</description>

Abstract: We determine the relationship between $\mathbb{C}_p^\times \times \mathbb{C}_p$ and a Berkovich space via an equivalence relation obtained by coarse-graining. This process also establishes a correspondence between $p$-adic fields and Bruhat-Tits trees. From this space, we give a previously unknown construction of the Berkovich projective line $\mathbb{P}_\text{Berk}^1$ and outline a direction for the development of a comprehensive theory of non-Archimedean AdS/CFT and consequently, adelic AdS/CFT, enabled by this construction.</description>

      <title>Zero-curvature subconformal structures and dispersionless integrability in dimension five</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the recent paradigm "Integrability via Geometry" from dimensions 3 and 4 to higher dimensions, relating dispersionless integrability of partial differential equations to curvature constraints of the background geometry. We observe that in higher dimensions on any solution manifold the symbol defines a vector distribution equipped with a subconformal structure, and the integrability imposes a certain compatibility between them.
  In dimension 5 we express dispersionless integrability via the vanishing of a certain curvature of this subconformal structure. We also obtain a "master equation" governing all second order dispersionless integrable equations in 5D, and count their functional dimension.
  It turns out that the obtained background geometry is parabolic of the type $(A_3,P_{13})$. We provide its Cartan theoretic description and compute the harmonic curvature components via the Kostant theorem. Then we relate it to 3D projective and 4D conformal geometries via twistor theory, discuss symmetry reductions and nested Lax sequences, as well as give another interpretation of dispersionless integrability in 5D through Levi-degenerate CR structures~in~7D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the subtleties that has made superstring perturbation theory intricate at high string loop order is the fact that as shown by Donagi and Witten, supermoduli space is not holomorphically projected, nor is it holomorphically split. In recent years, Sen (further refined by Sen and Witten) has introduced the notion of vertical integration in moduli space. This enables one to build BRST-invariant and well-defined amplitudes by adding certain correction terms to the contributions associated to the traditional "delta function" gauge fixing for the worldsheet gravitino on local patches. The Sen and Witten approach is made possible due to there being no obstruction to a smooth splitting of supermoduli space, but it may not necessarily be the most convenient or natural solution to the problem. In particular, this approach does not determine what these corrections terms actually are from the outset. Instead, it shows that such correction terms in principle exist, and when included make all perturbative amplitudes well-defined. There may be situations however where one would like to instead have a well-defined and fully determined path integral at arbitrary string loop order from the outset. In this paper, I initiate an alternative (differential-geometric) approach that implements the fact that a smooth gauge slice for supermoduli space always exists. As a warmup, I focus specifically on super Riemann surfaces with the topology of a sphere in heterotic string theory, incorporating the corresponding super curvature locally, and introduce a new well-defined smooth gauge fixing that leads to a globally defined path integral measure that translates arbitrary fixed ($-1$) picture NS vertex operators (or handle operators) (that may or may not be offshell) to integrated (0) picture. I also provide some comments on the extension to arbitrary super Riemann surfaces.</description>

Abstract: For a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, fixing a principal $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple and highest weight vectors induces a basis of $\mathfrak{g}$ as vector space. For $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, we describe how to compute the Lie bracket in this basis using transvectants. This generalizes a well-known rule for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ using Poisson brackets and degree 2 monomials in two variables. Our proof method uses a graphical calculus for classical invariant theory. Other Lie algebra types are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the percolation configuration arising from the random current representation of the near-critical Ising model on the complete graph. We compute the scaling limit of the cluster size distribution for an arbitrary set of sources in the single and the double current measures. As a byproduct, we compute the tangling probabilities recently introduced by Gunaratnam, Panagiotis, Panis, and Severo in [GPPS22]. This provides a new perspective on the switching lemma for the $\varphi^4$ model introduced in the same paper: in the Gaussian limit we recover Wick's law, while in the Ising limit we recover the corresponding tool for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation implies symmetry-protected topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of a new class of initially smooth spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system. These solutions exhibit supersonic gravitational implosion in the sense that the density blows-up in finite time while the fluid velocity remains supersonic. In particular, they occupy a portion of the phase space that is far from the recently constructed isentropic self-similar implosion. At the heart of our proof is the presence of a two-parameter scaling invariance and the reduction of the problem to a non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. We use the requirement of smoothness of the flow as a selection principle that constrains the choice of scaling indices. An important consequence of our analysis is that for all the solutions we construct, the polytropic index $\gamma$ is strictly bigger than $\frac{4}{3}$, which is in sharp contrast to the known results in the isentropic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era, we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits. We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively logarithmic depth, in the task of estimating observable expectation values. We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design an efficient classical algorithm to estimate observable expectation values within any constant additive accuracy, with high probability over the choice of the circuit, in any circuit architecture. The runtime of the algorithm is independent of circuit depth, and for any inverse-polynomial target accuracy, it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output observable expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.</description>

      <title>Learning in Associative Networks through Pavlovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hebbian learning theory is rooted in Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. While mathematical models of the former have been proposed and studied in the past decades, especially in spin glass theory, only recently it has been numerically shown that it is possible to write neural and synaptic dynamics that mirror Pavlov conditioning mechanisms and also give rise to synaptic weights that correspond to the Hebbian learning rule.
  In this paper, we show that the same dynamics can be derived with equilibrium statistical mechanics tools and basic and motivated modeling assumptions. Then, we show how to study the resulting system of coupled stochastic differential equations assuming the reasonable separation of neural and synaptic timescale. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that this synaptic evolution converges to the Hebbian learning rule in various settings and compute the variance of the stochastic process. Finally, drawing from evidence on pure memory reinforcement during sleep stages, we show how the proposed model can simulate neural networks that undergo sleep-associated memory consolidation processes, thereby proving the compatibility of Pavlovian learning with dreaming mechanisms.</description>

      <title>One loop effective actions in Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss the exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions by providing a proof of the DHS formula and explicitly computing it for new relevant cases. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally dominated instantons and instability of dS, AdS and Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. In the Appendix we briefly recall our results concerning estimates of the overlap for general fermionic Gaussian states of CAR.The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time approximation revisited and pole/cut structure in retarded correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to discuss the following two questions:
  Q1. Mathematical justification of the model of relaxation time approximation (RTA);
  Q2. Pole/cut structure in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description.
  We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Furthermore, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived non-analytical structures in this case. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenspectrum leads to dominant long-lived branch-cuts. When particles are massive or the perturbations are inhomogeneous, the non-analytical structures become more complex and richer.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of X-point collapse in an extended magnetohydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of X-point collapse in magnetic reconnection has witnessed extensive research in the context of space and laboratory plasmas. In this paper, a recently derived mathematical formulation of X-point collapse applicable in the regime of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure composed of five dynamical variables inherited from its parent model. The Hamiltonian and the noncanonical Poisson bracket are both derived, and the latter is shown to obey the requisite properties of antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity (an explicit proof of the latter is provided). In addition, the governing equations for the Casimir invariants are presented, and one such solution is furnished. The above features can be harnessed and expanded in future work, such as developing structure-preserving integrators for this dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Stretching of Polymers and turbulence: Fokker Planck equation, special stochastic scaling limit and stationary law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of polymer. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>

      <title>Stability of diverse dodecagonal quasicrystals in T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are intriguing ordered structures characterized by the lack of translational symmetry and the existence of rotational symmetry. The tiling of different geometric units such as triangles and squares in two-dimensional space can result in a great variety of quasicrystals that could be realized by the self-assembly of liquid crystalline molecules. In this study, we introduce three self-similar dodecagonal tilings, including a novel Diamond-Square-Triangle pattern, composed of triangular and quadrangular tiles and examine their thermodynamic stability by using the self-consistent field theory applied to T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. Specifically, we detail the inflation rules for the construction of these dodecagonal tilings and analyze their self-similarity, and show that these tilings can be viewed as projections of higher-dimensional periodic lattice points with projection windows. Using these dodecagonal tilings as initial configurations of the SCFT results in solutions corresponding to quasicrystals that could form from the T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. The relative stability of these aperiodic phases is analyzed to obtain design rules that could stabilize quasicrystals. Meanwhile, we provide two criteria for distinguishing three dodecagonal quasicrystals and their approximants by analyzing their diffraction peaks. These findings shed new lighten on the discovery of new quasicrystals in soft materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an autonomous second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), we define a Riemannian metric on an open subset of the first-order jet bundle. A relationship is established between the solutions of the ODE and the geodesic curves with respect to the defined metric. We introduce the notion of energy foliation for autonomous ODEs, and highlight its connection to the classical energy concept. Additionally, we explore the geometry of the leaves of the foliation. Finally, the results are applied to the analysis of Lagrangian mechanical systems. In particular, we provide an autonomous Lagrangian for the damped harmonic oscillator.</description>
