      <title>Absorbed power in ultracold polarized Fermi mixtures at normal-superfluid separation phase: Mass-imbalanced effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering ultracold spin-imbalanced Fermi-Fermi mixtures with different spin up and down masses, the absorbed power, subject to an external perturbation with low frequency, has been calculated. The system is composed of spin-up quasiparticles and spin-down quasiholes. The average chemical potential and energy gap have also been numerically calculated via applying different fixed interaction strengths and masses, and then by solving coupled differential equations characterized by Hartree-Fock potential for the spin species, as well as that of the phase separation (PS), leading to imbalance chemical potential. The dependence of the imbalance and average chemical potential in PS regime, to the polarization of the normal component, mass ratios, and interaction strengths are analyzed. Examining density of states (DOS), and by applying the Fermi golden rule at finite temperatures, the absorbed power has accordingly been calculated as a function of temperature, interaction strength, and mass ratio. Finally, the behavior of absorbed power versus frequency has been investigated.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams of spin-2 Floquet spinor Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the realization of a spin-2 Floquet spinor Bose-Einstein condensate via Floquet engineering of the quadratic Zeeman energy. In the Floquet system, the coupling strengths of all angular-momentum-conserving spin-flip processes are renormalized by driving-parameter-dependent Bessel functions. Such Floquet-engineered interactions significantly enriches possible ground states in homogeneous gases. The resulting phase diagrams, which map the distributions of these possible ground states, are presented in the space of the driving parameters.</description>

      <title>Collisional relaxation in shielded dipolar molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>

      <title>Near-Equilibrium Propagation training in nonlinear wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence, establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which system control is restricted to local parameters.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of laser cooling in molecules: From simple diatomics to polyatomics and radioactive species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Bloch equations and rate equations serve as powerful tools to model light-matter interactions from textbook-like two-level atoms to the complex internal dynamics of molecules. A particular challenge in this context is posed by molecular laser cooling, where many dozens or hundreds of levels need to be taken into account for a comprehensive modeling. Here, we present MoleCool, a numerically efficient Python toolbox to implement and solve the corresponding differential equation systems. We illustrate both the capabilities of the toolbox and some of the intricacies of molecular laser cooling by educational examples, which range from simple Rabi oscillations to spontaneous and coherent cooling schemes for various currently studied or considered molecular species. This includes, in particular, a comprehensive modeling of laser cooling dynamics with full hyperfine structure resolution in radioactive radium monofluoride (RaF), as well as studies of other complex species such as barium monofluoride (BaF) and ytterbium monohydroxide (YbOH).</description>

      <title>Quantum spin-tensor Hall effect protected by pseudo time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated family of the Hall effect plays a fundamental role in modern physics. Starting from the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the quantum AHE (QAHE) with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) to their spinful generalizations, including spin Hall effect (SHE) and quantum SHE (QSHE) protected by TRS, they reveal rich transport and topological phenomena. However, in larger-spin $S$ ($S&gt;1/2$) systems, besides charge current and spin current, there arise higher-rank spin-tensor currents. Recent work has uncovered an interesting spin-tensor Hall effect with spin-tensor currents in these larger-spin systems. Taking a step further, this work discovers a new class of topological states of matter dubbed \textit{quantum spin-tensor Hall} (QSTH) insulators with broken TRS, and their nontrivial topology is protected by a unique \textit{pseudo-TRS}. Most strikingly, QSTH insulators exhibit a quantized rank-2 spin-tensor Hall conductivity, whereas both charge (rank-0) and spin (rank-1) conductivities vanish. We also fully characterize their topological properties and highlight the physical interpretations via the underlying connections to QSHE. Our work enriches the family of the famous Hall effects and sheds light on the intriguing topological state of matter in larger-spin systems. It further offers new avenues toward spin-tensor-tronics and low-power atomtronics.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-assisted Observation of the Lowest Vibrational Level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ State of Ultracold LiK Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17166v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0&gt;$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1&gt;$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0&gt;$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0&gt;$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0&gt;$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.</description>

      <title>Kinetically-induced bound states in a frustrated Rydberg tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how particles bind into composite objects is a ubiquitous theme in physics, from the formation of molecules to hadrons in quantum chromodynamics and the pairing of charge carriers in superconductors. The formation of bound states usually originates from attractive interactions between particles. However, the binding can also arise purely from the motion of dopants due to kinetic frustration, which is potentially related to unconventional pairing in moir\'e materials. Here, we report the first direct observation of kinetically-induced bound states between holes and magnons using a Rydberg atom array quantum simulator of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model in frustrated ladders and 2D lattices. First, we demonstrate the formation of mobile one-hole-one-magnon bound states. We then construct three-particle one-hole-two-magnon bound states and reveal the underlying binding mechanism by observing kinetically-induced singlet correlations. Finally, we investigate how mobile dopants structure their magnetic environment in a spin-balanced 2D triangular lattice, showing that a hole induces $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order, while a doublon dopant generates in-plane ferromagnetic correlations. Our results demonstrates compelling evidence of kinetically-induced binding, opening a new avenue to understand novel pairing mechanisms in correlated quantum materials like superconductors in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Controlling few-body reaction pathways using a Feshbach resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaining control over chemical reactions on the quantum level is a central goal of the modern field of cold and ultracold chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination process across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the control of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that while the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body recombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains unchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction processes. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control schemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths.</description>

      <title>Static impurity in a mesoscopic system of SU($N$) fermionic matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a static impurity, modeled by a localized barrier, in a one-dimensional mesoscopic system comprised of strongly correlated repulsive SU($N$)-symmetric fermions. For a mesoscopic sized ring under the effect of an artificial gauge field, we analyze the energy spectrum, the particle density and the current flowing through the impurity at varying interaction strengths, barrier heights, and number of components. We find that the physics of the system is governed by the competition between effective single-particle process and the formation of a high-stiffness spin-correlated state associated to the phenomenon of fractionalization of the flux quantum characterizing the $N$-component fermionic system. Our findings provide a route to probe the response of SU($N$) fermions to effective magnetic fields; at the same time, they hold significance for fundamental understanding of localized impurity problems.</description>

      <title>Observable Resonances in Efimov-unfavored Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-body loss resonances associated with heavy-heavy-light Efimov states have been observed for over a decade in ultracold mixtures tuned near interspecies Feshbach resonances. For light-light-heavy systems, observing such resonances has been far more challenging due to the substantially large Efimov spacing. In these Efimov-unfavored systems, the intraspecies scattering length $a_\text{BB}$ has been shown to significantly affect the overall Efimov scenario, namely, the positions of the Efimov resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ and the three-body parameter (3BP) $a_{-}^{(0)}$. The present article explains the origin behind this influence by highlighting two primary mechanisms via which both the magnitude and sign of $a_\text{BB}$ govern the Efimov spectrum and set the resulting 3BP $a_{-}^{(0)}$. By employing van der Waals interactions for $^{23}$Na$_2{}^{40}$K, we attribute the vital role of $a_\text{BB}$ in Efimov-unfavored systems to the large difference between the Efimov scaling parameters for two and three resonant interactions, $s_0$ and $s_0^*$. In particular, we account for the unusually large $a_{-}^{(0)}$ obtained in light-light-heavy systems with $a_\text{BB}&gt;0$ (e.g., $^{41}$K$_2{}^{87}$Rb), and show that the first Efimov resonance can still occur at an experimentally accessible value when $a_\text{BB}&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal nonlocal anticorrelations in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</description>

Abstract: Optical lattices play a significant role in the field of cold atom physics, particularly in quantum simulations. Varying the lattice period is often a useful feature, but it presents the challenge of maintaining lattice phase stability in both stationary and varying-period regimes. Here, we report the realization of a low frequency feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase. The developed phase stabilization algorithm can be extended to more complicated 2D latices, than just periodic lattice.</description>

      <title>Analytical description of collisional decoherence in a BEC double-well accelerometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BEC-based quantum sensors offer a huge, yet not fully explored potential in gravimetry and ac- celerometry. In this paper, we study a possible setup for such a device, which is a weakly interacting Bose gas trapped in a double-well potential. In such a trap, the gas is known to exhibit Josephson oscillations, which rely on the coherence between the potential wells. Applying the density matrix approach, we consider transitions between the coherent, partially incoherent, and fully incoherent states of the Bose gas. We provide an analytical description of the collisional decoherence due to weak interactions, causing the Josephson oscillations to decay with time. In particular, we give the mathematical link between that decay in the density matrix approach and its interpretation in terms of phase fluctuations. To investigate the potential of the double-well setup as a quantum sensor we apply additional external acceleration to the system. The interplay of collisional interaction and ac- celeration leads to an additional shift of the oscillation frequency. We give the analytical expression for this shift and estimate the sensitivity of a hypothetical BEC double-well accelerometer based on that effect.</description>

Abstract: The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient
  magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the
  conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GS.
  The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions,
  is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the
  linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed-states near the GS
  phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex solitons are found to be stable even in
  the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers can be achieved
  as corresponding to stable GS and thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties
  in SOC BECs.</description>
