      <title>Interplay between pitch control and top speed in soccer: The stamina factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the interplay between player speed and ball control in soccer. We present a novel pitch control algorithm that quantifies the probability of a player gaining possession at any location on the field. Our model accounts for the heterogeneity of player speeds by measuring performance during matches and assigning each player a specific top speed. We then compare the pitch control percentages derived from our approach with those from classical models, which assume uniform top speeds for all players, and analyze the results across different player roles (defenders, midfielders, and forwards). Our findings reveal a positive correlation between a player's top speed and their accumulated pitch control, with certain players benefiting more from this relationship. However, this positive correlation is constrained by the role of the player in the team, with defenders achieving the highest accumulated pitch control despite not being the fastest. Furthermore, our methodology supports team-level analysis, identifying which teams gain the greatest advantage from their players' top speeds, and extends to comparisons between the first and second halves of matches. Our model also enables exploration of how changes in top speed may affect pitch control at both the individual and team levels. To facilitate this, we introduce the stamina factor, a parameter that adjusts a player's top speed. We find that the impact of the stamina factor on pitch control follows a logarithmic function, with the scaling factor quantifying the potential benefits of increased speed. Interestingly, the influence of the stamina factor varies significantly by player position. Overall, our approach provides valuable insights into which teams or players could benefit most from improvements in physical performance.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, the emergence of chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continues to puzzle scholars, due to its elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order (many-body) interactions greatly enhance the presence of chimera states, which are easier to be found and more persistent. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for its control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape collective behaviors in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>How communities shape epidemic spreading: A hierarchically structured metapopulation perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, and influenza have renewed interest in advancing epidemic models to better reflect the complexities of disease spreading. Modern approaches incorporate social norms, mobility patterns, and heterogeneous community structures to capture the interplay between social and biological dynamics. This study examines epidemic propagation in hierarchically structured metapopulation networks, where individuals interact within localized communities -- such as schools, workplaces, and theaters -- and diffuse across them. Using mean-field averaging, we derive a scaling law linking contagion rates to the mean connectivity degree, while stability analysis identifies thresholds for infection surges. In networks with heterogeneous mean degrees, spectral perturbation theory reveals how structural variability accelerates and amplifies disease spreading. We find that nodes with above-average degrees are not only infected earlier but also act as key outbreak drivers. Framing epidemic dynamics as a continuous phase transition, we apply pattern formation theory to show that the critical eigenvectors governing system stability are shaped by the network's degree distribution. Crucially, by analyzing Laplacian eigenvector localization, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between community infection densities and the entries of the critical eigenvector -- revealing how internal community structure directly shapes global infection patterns. This work provides a systematic framework for understanding and predicting epidemic dynamics in structured populations, while highlighting the fundamental role of community organization.</description>
