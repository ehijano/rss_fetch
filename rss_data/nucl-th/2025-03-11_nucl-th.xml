      <title>Reconstructing jet anisotropies with cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where quark-gluon plasma (QGP) forms, hadron production is anisotropic at both low and high transverse momentum, driven by flow dynamics and spatial anisotropies. To better understand these mechanisms, we use multi-particle correlations to reconstruct jet anisotropies. We simulate data using TennGen as a hydro-like background and combine it with PYTHIA-generated jets, clustering them with the anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm. Jet anisotropies are unfolded using a Bayesian technique, ensuring the robustness of the reconstructed signals. Our results demonstrate that multi-particle cumulant methods can accurately capture the differential jet azimuthal anisotropies, providing crucial insights into high-$p_{T}$ behavior and the dynamics within heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Electron capture cross sections and nuclear partition functions for fp-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present calculation of electron capture cross sections (ECC), in the limit of zero momentum transfer, using the pn QRPA model in stellar matter. Towards this aim we make use of our recently introduced recipe for estimation of nuclear partition functions. For low momentum transfer q tends to zero, the nuclear matrix elements of the P{\sigma}{\tau} plus operator provide the leading contribution to the total cross section which we estimate using the pn QRPA model in a multi shell single particle space with a schematic interaction. Key f p shell nuclei (odd A, even even and odd odd) bearing astrophysical importance were selected for the calculation of ECC in stellar environment. These f p shell nuclei play crucial role in pre supernova evolution of massive stars and core collapse. We further present microscopic calculation of ground and excited states Gamow Teller strength distributions and stellar electron capture rates on these suite of nuclei. We used two different sets of empirically determined pairing gaps to calculate the ECC and electron capture rates. Results are compared with experimental data and previous computations. Our calculated ECC are systematically smaller at low electron incident energies as compared to the shell model results.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the inner crust of neutron stars within the superfluid band theory: Competition between $^1\text{S}_0$ pairing and spin polarization under finite temperature and magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions of matter under changes of external environment such as temperature and magnetic field have attracted great interests to various quantum many-body systems. Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\sim10^{16}\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.</description>

      <title>Quartet correlations near the surface of $ N = Z $ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Cooper quartet correlations in $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nuclei ($ {}^{40} \mathrm{Ca} $, $ {}^{100} \mathrm{Sn} $, and $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $). We first examine the quartet condensation fraction in infinite symmetric nuclear matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interactions responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated as about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multi-nucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton neutron quasiparticle RPA is used for the first time to calculate weak interaction rates for sd and fp shell nuclei at high temperatures and densities. The calculated rates take into consideration the latest experimental energy levels and ft value compilations. Particle emission processes from excited states are taken into account. The calculation is done for 700 nuclei with mass number ranging from 18 to 100. The astrophysical applications of the calculated rates are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Effect of Nuclear Deformation on Electron Capture Cross-section on Chromium Isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron capture plays significant role in the pre supernova and supernova evolutions of massive stars which in turn are of great importance in synthesizing heavy elements beyond iron. In this paper we study the effect of nuclear deformation on the computed electron capture cross section on selected even even chromium isotopes (464850Cr). The nuclear deformation parameters were computed using two different theoretical models: Interacting Boson Model (IBM 1) and Macroscopic (Yukawa plus exponential) microscopic (Folded Yukawa) model (Mac mic model). A third value of deformation parameter was adopted from experimental data. We chose the pn QRPA model to perform our calculations. The predictive power of the chosen model was first tested by calculating Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of selected fp shell nuclei where measured GT data was available. The calculated GT strength distributions were well fragmented over the energy range 0 12 MeV and were noted to be in decent agreement with experimental data. The total GT strength was found to increase (decrease) with decrease (increase) in the value of deformation parameter for the three chromium isotopes. The computed GT strength distributions satisfied the model independent Ikeda sum rule. The ECC were calculated as a function of the deformation parameter at core temperature 1.0 MeV. Our results show that the calculated ECC increased with increasing value of nuclear deformation.</description>

      <title>Bound state formation within the Lindblad approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a frequently used Markovian approach to describe open quantum systems in terms of the temporal evolution of a reduced density matrix. Here, the thermal environment is traced out to obtain an expression to describe the evolution of what is called a system: one particle or a chain of interacting particles, which is/are surrounded by a thermal heat bath. In this work, we investigate the formation of non-relativistic bound states, involving the P\"oschl-Teller potential, in order to discuss the formation time and the thermal equilibrium, applying scales from nuclear physics. This problem is borrowed from the field of heavy-ion collisions, where the deuteron is a probe which is measured at temperature regimes around the chemical freeze out temperature, while the deuteron itself has a binding energy which is much lower. This is known and often described as a ``snowball in hell". We use a reformulated Lindblad equation, in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provide a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation.</description>

      <title>Role of the isovector spin-orbit potential in mitigating the CREX-PREX dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pioneering electroweak measurements of the neutron skin thickness in lead-208 and calcium-48 are challenging our understanding of nuclear dynamics. Many theoretical models suggest that the slope of the symmetry energy controls the development of a neutron skin in neutron-rich nuclei. This led to the expectation that if lead-208 exhibits a large neutron skin, calcium-48 should as well. Given that the PREX collaboration reported a relatively thick neutron skin in lead, we anticipated that calcium would also have a significant neutron skin. Instead, the CREX collaboration reported a thin neutron skin in calcium. Although many suggestions have been proposed, the ``CREX-PREX dilemma" remains unsolved. Recently, an intriguing scenario has emerged, suggesting that an enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction could simultaneously account for both results. Following this approach, we performed relativistic mean-field calculations with an increased isovector spin-orbit potential. Our findings indicate that while this modification significantly affects the structure of calcium-48, it has only a marginal impact on lead-208, thereby bringing the results into better agreement with experiment. However, the strong enhancement required to mitigate the CREX-PREX dilemma destroys the agreement with a successful spin-orbit phenomenology, primarily by modifying the well-known ordering of spin-orbit partners.</description>

      <title>Quantum energies of solitons with different topological charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

      <title>Study of deeply virtual Compton scattering at the future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the impact of future measurements of deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) with the ePIC detector at the electron-ion collider (EIC), currently under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The considered process is sensitive to generalized parton distributions (GPDs), the understanding of which is a cornerstone of the EIC physics programme. Our study marks a milestone in the preparation of DVCS measurements at EIC and provides a reference point for future analyses. In addition to presenting distributions of basic kinematic variables obtained with the latest ePIC design and simulation software, we examine the impact of future measurements on the understanding of nucleon tomography and DVCS Compton form factors, which are directly linked to GPDs. We also assess the impact of radiative corrections and background contribution arising from exclusive $\pi^0$ production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD) -- the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model. Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with constituent-like masses. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches the role played by EHM in shaping hadron electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, exciting nucleon resonances, and moulding hadron parton distributions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A functional measure encompasses quantum corrections and is explored in the fluid/gravity correspondence. Corrections to response and transport coefficients in the second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics are proposed, including the ones to the pressure, the relaxation time, and the shear relaxation. Their dependence on the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) temperature sets a temperature dependence on the running parameter encoding the one-loop quantum gravity correction, driven by a functional measure. The experimental range of the bulk viscosity-to-entropy density ratio of the QGP corroborates the existence of the functional measure.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the general analytic solution space for relativistic $(1+1)$-dimensional hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid flowing along the longitudinal direction. We work out the explicit one-parameter family of interpolating flows between boost-invariant and boost-non-invariant regimes, where a direct and simple dialing of the parameter at the level of solutions is possible. We also discuss the construction of generalised rapidity distribution of entropy for such interpolating flows at the level of potentials.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Classical Approximation of Electromagnetic Radiation by Fermions embedded in Rigidly Rotating Medium in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the quasi-classical (WKB) approximation of the synchrotron radiation by a fermion embedded into uniformly rotating system in external magnetic field. We show that it gives an accurate approximation of the exact expression that we recently obtained at a tiny fraction of the numerical cost. Our results can be used to compute the electromagnetic radiation of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Novel concept for low-energy antineutron production and its application for antineutron scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive data of antiproton scattering cross sections with protons and nuclei have advanced our understanding of hadronic interactions with antinucleons. However, low-energy antineutron scattering data are scarce, thereby limiting our understanding of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon and antinucleon-nucleus interactions. We present a novel production scheme of extremely low-energy antineutrons that could remedy this situation. This method is based on backward charge-exchange reaction ($p\bar{p}\to n\bar{n}$), and can reach the lowest momentum of 9 MeV/c, which would be well suited to study of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon or antinucleon-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions of ground state mesons composed of $c$ or $b$ quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The valence quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of all ground state heavy mesons that composed of $b$ or $c$ quarks, are discussed; namely, the pseudoscalar $\eta_c(1S)$, $\eta_b(1S)$ and $B_c$, together with the corresponding vector ones, $J/\psi$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $B_c^\ast$. We use a QCD-inspired constituent quark model, which has been applied with success to conventional heavy mesons, so that one advantage here is that all parameters have already been fixed by previous studies. The wave functions of the heavy mesons in the rest frame are obtained by solving the Schr\"odinger equation, then boosted to its light-front based on Susskind's Lorentz transformation. The PDFs at the hadron scale, are then obtained by integrating out the transverse momenta of the modulus square of the light-front wave function. Our study shows how the valence quark distributions differ between pseudoscalar and vector mesons, as well as among charmonia, bottomonia and bottom-charmed mesons. Comparisons with other theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDFs obtained herein are in general narrower but align well with the expected patterns. Moreover, each PDF's point-wise behavior is squeezed with respect to the scale-free parton-like PDF.</description>

      <title>Modern nuclear and astrophysical constraints of dense matter in a renormalized chiral approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram's complexities, including quark deconfinement transitions, liquid-gas phase changes, and critical points, using the chiral mean-field (CMF) model that is able to capture all these features. We introduce a vector meson renormalization within the CMF framework, enabling precise adjustments of meson masses and coupling strengths related to vector meson interactions. Performing a new fit to the deconfinement potential, we are able to replicate recent lattice QCD results, low energy nuclear physics properties, neutron star observational data, and key phase diagram features as per modern constraints. This approach enhances our understanding of vector mesons' roles in mediating nuclear interactions and their impact on the equation of state, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the QCD phase diagram and its implications for nuclear and astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Two-cluster approach to the properties of one- and two-neutron-halo nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new approximate method for obtaining simple wave functions for the ground state of exotic nuclei with a neutron halo. We model the system as a two-cluster structure, treating the core and halo as inert objects. The relative wave function is expressed as a combination of simple harmonic oscillator states, with the oscillator parameter determined from the separation energy. Since these wave functions lack the expected exponential decay, we introduce a simple multiplicative renormalization factor based on the nuclear root mean square radius. This approach, combining oscillator wave functions and the renormalization factor, is then applied to calculate dipole strength distributions $dB(E1,\varepsilon)/d\varepsilon$ and Coulomb dissociation cross section $d\sigma(E1,\varepsilon)/d\varepsilon$ for several $1n$- and $2n$-halo nuclei. The results show excellent agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The configuration interaction relativistic Hartree-Fock (CI-RHF) model is developed in this work. Compared to the conventional configuration interaction shell model calculations, the CI-RHF model can be applied to study the structural properties of a wide range of nuclei without readjusting any parameters, because the effective Hamiltonian for different model space can be deduced consistently from a universal density-dependent Lagrangian based on the Hartree-Fock single-particle basis. The convergence of intermediate-state excitations has been examined in evaluating the effective interactions, and the core-polarization effects are illustrated, by using $^{18}$O as an example. Employing the CI-RHF model, both the bulk properties and low-lying spectra of neon isotopes in the $sd$ shell have been well reproduced without introducing additional parameters besides those well-defined in the phenomenological Lagrangian. Moreover, the study of the isotopic evolution of charge radii and low-lying spectra highlights the shell closure at $N=14$ for neon isotopes.</description>

      <title>Transverse and longitudinal spin alignment from color fields in heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the spin alignment of vector mesons stemming from spin correlation of the quark and antiquark induced by background color fields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The quark-coalescence equation relating the collision kernel of the vector-meson kinetic equation to spin alignment is expanded to the relativistic case. Focusing on the color-octet contribution, the spin alignment for $\phi$ mesons from glasma fields with momentum dependence is investigated, where the scenarios for different spin quantization axes are considered. Moreover, we qualitatively analyze the spin alignment from isotropic color fields in the quark gluon plasma phase for comparison. In particular, we propose that the experimental measurement of spin alignment along the beam direction, dubbed as the longitudinal spin alignment, could be useful to identify the dominance of longitudinal spin correlation potentially led by the glasma effect in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Implications of latest NICER data for the neutron star equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the neutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional impact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined. Including the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base results in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of radii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.1\,M_\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values of $R_{1.4} = 12.1\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the 68\% level), and central densities increase slightly to values of $n_c(1.4\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 = 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation density at the 68\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence established by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure, $\Delta = 1/3-P/\varepsilon &lt; 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to strong.</description>

      <title>Effects of a first-order QCD phase transition on light nucleus production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the baryon density fluctuations of quark matter along the isentropic trajectories corresponding to different $s/\rho_B$ values extracted from Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-200$ GeV, we investigate the effects of the two-phase coexistence region during a first-order phase transition on the light nucleus yield ratio $N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$. The results indicate that the second-order scaled density moment $y_2$, used to quantify density fluctuations, rapidly increases to form a peak when the isentropic trajectories pass through the coexistence region. We extract the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ at chemical freeze-out from the isentropic trajectories at different collision energies and found significant enhancements at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV. This is similar to the trends observed by the STAR experiment, suggesting that the enhancements in the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ observed in the STAR experiment could be explained by the density fluctuations generated in the first-order phase transition region.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the charge-parity violating effects through axion field, we investigate the axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars. The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\odot}$ massive neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is proven that a polarized neutron gets accelerated by internal nuclear forces along the coherent rotation of its spin. A net internal force upon the neutron arises from the chiral weak interactions between its quarks, which results from the simultaneous breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetries by the weak nuclear interaction and the spin polarization of the neutron, respectively. The variation of the neutron's kinetic momentum is accompanied with the transfer of an equivalent linear momentum to the fields of the Z and W-bosons that mediate the interactions, in the opposite direction. The effect is linear in Fermi's constant. Using the simplest hadron models, an upper bound of the order of meters per second is estimated for the velocity variation of the polarized neutron along the spin-flip process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are near-threshold resonances, virtual states or bound states. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be used to unambiguously distinguish between these three scenarios. More concretely, we show that the low-momentum $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions significantly differ in the three scenarios. The high-momentum results exhibit distinct characteristics in the resonant and virtual state scenarios, especially in small collision systems of 1 fm, as produced in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. We hope all these discoveries can stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states discovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a ``snowball in hell'' since it emerges from a hadron resonance gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the ``contact'' that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron resonance gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Collisional corrections to spin polarization from quantum kinetic theory using Chapman-Enskog expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the collisional corrections to the spin polarization pseudo-vector, $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$, using quantum kinetic theory in Chapman-Enskog expansion. We derive the spin Boltzmann equation incorporating M{\o}ller scattering process. We further consider two distinct scenarios using hard thermal loop approximations for simplification. In scenario (I), the vector charge distribution function is treated as off-equilibrium under the validity domain of gradient expansion. Remarkably, the polarization induced by gradients of thermal chemical potential and shear viscous tensors are modified, but $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario does not depend on the coupling constant. In scenario (II), the vector charge distribution function is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Then collisional corrections $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario are at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^{2}\partial^{2})$. Additionally, we evaluate the $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$ using relaxation time approach for comparative analysis. Our results establish the theoretical framework necessary for the future numerical investigations on the interaction corrections to spin polarization.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel analysis of the near-threshold $e^+e^-\to N\bar{N}$ cross sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible existence of nucleon-antinucleon bound states has been studied for decades. We investigate the $e^+e^-\to p\bar{p}$ and $e^+e^-\to n\bar{n}$ cross sections in the nonrelativistic effective field theory framework. The proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron coupled-channel final state interactions are considered and found responsible for near-threshold enhancements. Both the proton-neutron mass difference and the Coulomb interaction between $p$ and $\bar{p}$ are considered, and the $N\bar{N}$ strong interactions are taken into account through a short-distance optical potential. By fitting the low energy constants in the amplitudes to the data for the near-threshold $e^+e^-\to N\bar{N}$ cross sections from the BESIII and SND Collaborations, a $N\bar{N}$ quasi-bound state is found just above the $p\bar{p}$ threshold, and another $N\bar{N}$ pole is found on the unphysical Riemann sheet, farther away from the threshold. The constructed coupled-channel amplitude with Coulomb effects also offers a framework that can be used directly in experimental analyses on fine structures near the $N\bar{N}$ thresholds.</description>

      <title>Nucleon relativistic weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic full weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions inside a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron are systematically studied for the first time, where the second-class current contribution associated with the induced pseudotensor form factor (FF) is included. We clearly demonstrate that the 3D axial charge distribution, being parity-odd in the Breit frame, is in fact related to the induced pseudotensor FF $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than the axial FF $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving hadron, and compare them with their light-front counterparts. We revisit the role played by the Melosh rotation, and understand more easily and intuitively the origins of distortions appearing in light-front distributions (relative to the Breit frame ones) using the conjecture that we propose in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii. We finally illustrate our results in the case of a proton using the weak-neutral axial-vector FFs extracted from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the influence of excitation energy and compound nucleus angular momentum on fission fragment angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the large angular momenta observed for fission fragments is still a question under discussion. To address this, we study isomeric yield ratios (IYR), i.e. the relative population of two or more long-lived metastable states with different spins, of fission products.
  We report on IYR of 17 isotopes produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the IGISOL facility of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a. The fissioning nuclei in this reaction are $^{233,234,235}$U*. We compare our data to IYR from thermal neutron-induced fission of $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U, and we observe statistically significant larger IYR in the $^{232}$Th($\alpha$,f) reaction, where the average compound nucleus (CN) spin is 7.5 $\hbar$, than in $^{233,235}$U(n$_{th}$,f), with average spins 2.5 and 3.5 $\hbar$, respectively.
  To assess the influence of the excitation energy, we study literature data of IYR from photon-induced fission reactions, and find that the IYR are independent of the CN excitation energy. We conclude that the different IYR must be explained by the different CN spin alone. This implies that the FF angular momentum only partly comes from the fission process itself, and is in addition influenced by the angular momentum present in the CN.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>
