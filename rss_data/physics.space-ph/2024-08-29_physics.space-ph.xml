      <title>Catastrophic cooling in optically thin plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar corona is the prototypical example of a low density environment heated to high temperatures by external sources. The plasma cools radiatively, and because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to model the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by modifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the local heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and even multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these source terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling of the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate, much simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these source terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The linear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953), and we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization equilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic cooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an alternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium character, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with the production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas.</description>

      <title>The impacts of solar wind on the Martian upper atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the first in-situ measurements of the altitude profile of upper atmospheric density and composition were carried out by the Viking lander missions in 1976, similar data are continuously gathered by MAVEN and MOM spacecraft orbiting Mars since their launch in September 2014 with mass spectrometers and other related payloads. Using near-simultaneous observations by the two orbiters, it is seen that both data sets indicate significant day-to-day variations of Argon density profiles in the thermosphere-exosphere, 150-300 km region, during the period 1-15, June 2018, when the solar EUV radiation did not show any appreciable change but the solar wind energetic particle fluxes did so. Extending this study to include the other parent atmospheric constituents carbon dioxide, helium, nitrogen and their photochemical products atomic oxygen, and carbon monoxide during the same period it is found that the density profiles of carbon dioxide and atomic oxygen also show similar variations with carbon dioxide densities showing an increasing trend similar to Argon, but a reversal of this trend for atomic oxygen densities. Using insitu and near simultaneous measurements of solar EUV fluxes and the solar wind plasma velocities and densities near MAVEN periapsis it is noted that, unlike the solar EUV radiation, solar wind parameters showed a decrease by a factor of 2-3. Hence, it is inferred that the energetic and penetrating solar wind charged particle impact-driven dissociation, ionisation and ion-chemical processes could decrease the carbon dioxide densities leading to an increase in atomic oxygen densities. This result is also discussed from the considerations of the proton gyro radius effect, pickup ions, sputtering, energetic neutral atoms driven ionisation and ion losses. Further data and modelling efforts would be necessary to confirm this finding.</description>
