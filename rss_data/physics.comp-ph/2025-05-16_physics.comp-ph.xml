      <title>Neural models for prediction of spatially patterned phase transitions: methods and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models' capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model generalization.</description>

      <title>PyLIT: Reformulation and implementation of the analytic continuation problem using kernel representation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations are a cornerstone for studying quantum many-body systems. The analytic continuation (AC) needed to estimate dynamic quantities from these simulations is an inverse Laplace transform, which is ill-conditioned. If this inversion were surmounted, then dynamical observables (e.g. dynamic structure factor (DSF) $S(q,\omega)$) could be extracted from the imaginary-time correlation functions estimates.
  Although of important, the AC problem remains challenging due to its ill-posedness. To address this challenge, we express the DSF as a linear combination of kernel functions with known Laplace transforms that have been tailored to satisfy its physical constraints. We use least-squares optimization regularized with a Bayesian prior to determine the coefficients of this linear combination. We explore various regularization term, such as the commonly used entropic regularizer, as well as the Wasserstein distance and $L^2$-distance as well as techniques for setting the regularization weight. A key outcome is the open-source package PyLIT (\textbf{Py}thon \textbf{L}aplace \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{T}ransform), which leverages Numba and unifies the presented formulations. PyLIT's core functionality is kernel construction and optimization.
  In our applications, we find PyLIT's DSF estimates share qualitative features with other more established methods. We identify three key findings. Firstly, independent of the regularization choice, utilizing non-uniform grid point distributions reduced the number of unknowns and thus reduced our space of possible solutions. Secondly, the Wasserstein distance, a previously unexplored regularizer, performs as good as the entropic regularizer while benefiting from its linear gradient. Thirdly, future work can meaningfully combine regularized and stochastic optimization.

      <title>Brownian Dynamics Simulations of Inclusions in an Active Fluid Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out two-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations of the behavior of rigid inclusion particles immersed in an active fluid bath. The active fluid is modeled as a collection of self-propelled circular disks interacting via a soft repulsive potential and a nematic alignment interaction. The fluid is characterized by its nematic order, polar order and orientational correlation length. The active fluid bath transitions from the isotropic to the nematic phase with increasing number density, increasing nematic interaction strength or increasing P\'eclet number. The inclusion particles are modeled as rigid assemblies of passive circular disks. Four types of inclusions are considered: a rod-like $I$ shape, a boomerang-like $L$ shape, and stair-like shapes $Z$ and $Z^*$, with opposite handedness. When inclusions are introduced into the active fluid bath, their diffusion is significantly enhanced by the force and torque exerted by the active fluid particles and the chiral inclusion particles exhibit constant rotational drift. These diffusion and rotation enhancements increase as the swimming speed of the active fluid particles increases. The translational motion of the inclusion particles also couples with their orientational motion, and the correlation is modulated by the active fluid particles' swimming speed. This work paves the way for future simulations of inclusions in active fluid baths and suggests potential avenues for controlling transport properties in active materials.</description>

      <title>Strontium I, III, IV and V: Electron Impact Excitation Data for Kilonovae and White Dwarf Diagnostic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium (Sr) emissions have been observed across a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from kilonovae (KNe) events to white dwarf (WD) stars. Precise and extensive atomic data for low ionisation stages of Sr is required for accurate theoretical modelling and to improve our understanding of evolutionary pathways. We calculated energy levels, Einstein A coefficients and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for Sr I, Sr III, Sr IV and Sr V at the temperature and density ranges of interest in KNe and WD research. We developed new target structures using the GRASP0 and AUTOSTRUCTURE packages. The energies and A-values arising from the new structures were found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical equivalents reported in the literature. Maxwellian averaged electron impact collision strengths were calculated using the R-matrix approach, as applied through the DARC and RMBP coding packages. These are presented in adf04 file format. The new data sets allowed us to construct synthetic spectra for the first five ionisation stages of Sr and probe possible density and temperature diagnostic lines. The synthetic spectra within the KNe regime revealed possible Sr IV and Sr V candidate lines at 1027.69nm and 1203.35nm respectively. These may provide useful benchmarks for determining the extent of Sr ionisation that can be reached in an evolving KNe event. Additional diagnostic lines were found to be poor across the Sr ion stages for both KNe and WD regimes due to most levels being in either coronal or Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions.</description>

      <title>Nature-inspired optimization, the Philippine Eagle, and cosmological parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) belongs to a class of nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms that leverage concepts from natural selection to perform optimization tasks. In cosmology, the standard method for estimating parameters is the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, renowned for its reliability in determining cosmological parameters. This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$CDM model, we explore the impact of GA's key hyperparameters -- such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate -- on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Dynamics in Physical Modelling Synthesis using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Power Law Behavior in the Spatial and Frequency Domain Governing Thermal Slip at a Liquid/Solid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated chips for power intensive graphics and computer processing applications dissipate so much heat nowadays that liquid based cooling has become practically essential to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway. Fortunately, cooling schemes based on immersion technology or microfluidic networks are proving effective. However, further progress ultimately requires tackling the intrinsic thermal impedance caused by the discontinuity in properties across the liquid/solid (L/S) interface. Since experimental tools still lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for this purpose and given there are no analytic models for phonon propagation across the L/S interface, researchers have come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The goal of this computational study was to determine whether there exist compact general equations for the thermal slip length based on correlated behavior in the L/S contact zone. The results reveal power law equations for the thermal slip length incorporating the influence of molecular interaction parameters, local temperature, long range translational order and peak vibrational frequencies. These findings offer a promising route forward directed at the influence of surface localized phonons in the L/S contact zone.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Micro-Void Development within Large Scale Additively Manufactured Polymer Composite Deposition Beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the growing level of technological advancement that characterizes extrusion-deposition additive manufacturing technology, there remains a significant knowledge gap in fully understanding the process-structure-property relationship involved in this technology. Modeling the polymer melt flow extrusion-deposition process is important in understanding the development of the inherent microstructure within the print beads, particularly the micro-voids formation and growth which significantly affects the resulting material properties and part performance. The current research presents a computational-based approach for investigating process-induced micro-voids and their impact on print properties. We develop a multiscale FEA simulation tool to predict global and local flow-fields during the polymer-melt flow process to investigate underlying mechanisms that may promote the micro-void development within the bead microstructure specifically the occurrence of low-pressure regions at sites of stress concentration such as at the tips of suspended fibers and at locations with abrupt changes in flow direction like the die-swell region just after the nozzle exit. The research also investigates potential factors that may influence the growth and development of these micro-voids such as the suspension viscosity and shear-thinning polymer melt rheology, the size and geometry of the reinforcing particles, etc. Furthermore, the research presents a method for quantifying and characterizing micro-voids within printed beads and assessing their impact on the effective material properties. The direct implication of reduced bead porosity levels is the development of high-quality functional components for specialized applications such as light weight &amp; high strength integrity composites widely used in a variety of industries particularly the automobile, aerospace, renewable energy and defense industries.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning with Physics Knowledge for Prediction: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey examines the broad suite of methods and models for combining machine learning with physics knowledge for prediction and forecast, with a focus on partial differential equations. These methods have attracted significant interest due to their potential impact on advancing scientific research and industrial practices by improving predictive models with small- or large-scale datasets and expressive predictive models with useful inductive biases. The survey has two parts. The first considers incorporating physics knowledge on an architectural level through objective functions, structured predictive models, and data augmentation. The second considers data as physics knowledge, which motivates looking at multi-task, meta, and contextual learning as an alternative approach to incorporating physics knowledge in a data-driven fashion. Finally, we also provide an industrial perspective on the application of these methods and a survey of the open-source ecosystem for physics-informed machine learning.</description>

      <title>Neural network-augmented eddy viscosity closures for turbulent premixed jet flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending gradient-type turbulence closures to turbulent premixed flames is challenging due to the significant influence of combustion heat release. We incorporate a deep neural network (DNN) into Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models for the turbulent viscosity and thermal conductivity as nonlinear functions of the local flow state and thermochemical gradients. Our models are optimized over the RANS partial differential equations (PDEs) using an adjoint-based data assimilation procedure. Because we directly target the RANS solution, as opposed to the unclosed terms, successfully trained models are guaranteed to improve the in-sample accuracy of the DNN-augmented RANS predictions. We demonstrate the learned closures for in- and out-of-sample $\textit{a posteriori}$ RANS predictions of compressible, premixed, turbulent jet flames with turbulent Damk\"ohler numbers spanning the gradient- and counter-gradient transport regimes. The DNN-augmented RANS predictions have one to two orders of magnitude lower spatiotemporal mean-squared error than those using a baseline $k$--$\epsilon$ model, even for Damk\"ohler numbers far from those used for training. This demonstrates the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of the PDE-constrained modeling approach for turbulent jet flames over this relatively wide Damk\"ohler number range.</description>
