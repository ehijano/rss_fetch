      <title>Efficiency of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the efficiency of turbulence, a dimensionless parameter that characterises the fraction of the input energy stored into a turbulent flow field. We first show that the inverse of the efficiency provides an upper bound for the dimensionless energy injection in a turbulent flow. We analyse the efficiency of turbulence for different flows using numerical and experimental data. Our analysis suggests that efficiency is bounded from above, and, in some cases, saturates following a power law reminiscent of phase transitions and bifurcations. We show that for the von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n flow the efficiency saturation is insensitive to the details of the forcing impellers. In the case of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection, we show that within the Grossman and Lohse model, the efficiency saturates in the inviscid limit, while the dimensionless kinetic energy injection/dissipation goes to zero. In the case of pipe flow, we show that saturation of the efficiency cannot be excluded, but would be incompatible with the Prandtl law of the drag friction coefficient. Furthermore, if the power law behaviour holds for the efficiency saturation, it can explain the kinetic energy and the energy dissipation defect laws proposed for the shear flows. Efficiency saturation is an interesting empirical property of turbulence that may help in evaluating the ''closeness'' of experimental and numerical data to the true turbulent regime, wherein the kinetic energy saturates to its inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent modelling and simulation of the moving contact line problem in non-isothermal compressible two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the dynamic van der Waals theory, we propose a thermodynamically consistent model for non-isothermal compressible two-phase flows with contact line motion. In this model, fluid temperature is treated as a primary variable, characterized by the proposed temperature equation instead of being obtained from intermediate variables such as total energy density, internal energy density and entropy density. The hydrodynamic boundary conditions, which represent a generalization of the generalized Navier slip boundary condition in non-isothermal flows, are imposed on the proposed model. We then develop the dimensionless form of the model and prove that it rigorously satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Two numerical schemes based on the dimensionless system are constructed: one is fully coupled and thermodynamically consistent, namely strictly satisfying the temporally discrete first and second laws of thermodynamics; the other, designed by extending the multiple scalar auxiliary variable approach to entropy production, is decoupled, linear, and unconditionally entropy-stable. Several numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Plane-marching PSE wavepacket models for perfectly-expanded twin jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of wavepackets in the generation of mixing noise in twin jets is expected by extrapolation of the insights previously obtained from the study of single isolated jets. This work presents wavepacket models for supersonic round twin jets operating at perfectly-expanded conditions, computed via plane-marching parabolized stability equations based on mean flows obtained from the compressible RANS equations. High-speed schlieren visualizations and non-time-resolved PIV measurements are performed to obtain experimental datasets for validating the modelling strategy. The RANS solutions are found to be in good quantitative agreement with the PIV mean-flow measurements, confirming the ability of the approach to capture the interaction between jets at the mean-flow level. The obtained wavepackets consist of toroidal and flapping fluctuations of the twin-jet system, and show similarities with those of single axisymmetric jets. However, for the case of closely-spaced jets, they exhibit deviations in the phase speed of structures travelling in the outer mixing layer and those travelling in the inner one, leading to different non-axisymmetric behaviours. In particular, toroidal twin-jet wavepackets feature tilted ring-like structures with respect to the jet axis, while flapping twin-jet wavepackets are distorted and lose the clean checkerboard pattern typically observed in $m = 1$ modes in axisymmetric jets. A quantitative comparison of the modelled wavepackets with experimentally-educed coherent structures is performed in terms of their structural agreement measured through an alignment coefficient, providing a first validation of the modelling strategy. Alignment coefficients are found to be particularly high in the intermediate range of studied frequencies.</description>

      <title>On the structure and dynamics of secondary flows over multi-column roughness in turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary flows induced by spanwise heterogeneous surface roughness play a crucial role in determining engineering-relevant metrics such as surface drag, convective heat transfer, and the transport of airborne scalars. While much of the existing literature has focused on idealized configurations with regularly spaced roughness elements, real-world surfaces often feature irregularities, clustering, and topographic complexity for which the secondary flow response remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigate multi-column roughness configurations that serve as a regularized analog of roughness clustering. Using large-eddy simulations, we systematically examine the effects of cluster density and local arrangement on secondary flows, and observe that varying the cluster density gives rise to distinct secondary flow polarities. Through a systematic parameter study, we identify the spanwise gap between the edge-most roughness elements of adjacent columns, normalized by the channel half-height, as a key geometric factor governing this polarity. In addition to analyzing the time-averaged structure, we investigate how variations in polarity affect the instantaneous dynamics of secondary flows. Here, we find that the regions of high- and low-momentum fluid created by the secondary flows alternate in a chaotic, non-periodic manner over time. Further analysis of the vertical velocity signal shows that variability in vertical momentum transport is a persistent and intrinsic feature of secondary flow dynamics. Taken together, these findings provide a comprehensive picture of how the geometric arrangement of roughness elements governs both the mean structure and temporal behavior of secondary flows.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability analysis of the chaotic flow past two square cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of the flow past two side-by-side square cylinders (at Reynolds number 200 and gap ratio 1) using tools from dynamical systems theory. The flow is highly irregular due to the complex interaction between the flapping jet emanating from the gap and the vortices shed in the wake. We first perform Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) to understand the flow characteristics. We then conduct Lyapunov stability analysis by linearizing the Navier-Stokes equations around the irregular base flow and find that it has two positive Lyapunov exponents. The Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs) are also computed. Contours of the time-averaged CLVs reveal that the footprint of the leading CLV is in the near-wake, whereas the other CLVs peak further downstream, indicating distinct regions of instability. SPOD of the two unstable CLVs is then employed to extract the dominant coherent structures and oscillation frequencies in the tangent space. For the leading CLV, the two dominant frequencies match closely with the prevalent frequencies in the drag coefficient spectrum, and correspond to instabilities due to vortex shedding and jet-flapping. The second unstable CLV captures the subharmonic instability of the shedding frequency. Global linear stability analysis (GLSA) of the time-averaged flow identifies a neutral eigenmode that resembles the leading SPOD mode of the first CLV, with a very similar structure and frequency. However, while GLSA predicts neutrality, Lyapunov analysis reveals that this direction is unstable, exposing the inherent limitations of the GLSA when applied to chaotic flows.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of freezing efficiency for a moving droplet in the microchannel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In microfluidic devices, droplets serving as carriers for chemical reactors or biomass can form stably encapsulated particles during the freezing process, holding significant importance in pharmaceuticals and microchemical reaction control. This study couples the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method with an enthalpy-porous media phase change model to distinguish the water (ice)-oil two-phase system and the water-ice two-phase system, respectively.The simulation reveals two distinct solidification patterns: Pattern I exhibits a uniform and symmetric pattern, occurring at lower Reynolds numbers (Re) or droplet-to-channel diameter ratios (D/W), resulting in a relatively even solid shell along the interface with synchronized solidification fronts in both flow and spanwise directions, dominated by heat conduction. Pattern II shows a shear-constraint cooperative non-uniform pattern at higher Reynolds numbers and D/W ratios, where flow dynamics and spatial confinement couple, leading to faster solidification at the tail region and an asymmetric solidification front. Through comprehensive analysis of the numerical results, we derived the characteristic behavior of the Stefan number (Ste), Reynolds number (Re), and D/W ratios on the freezing time. We established a unified scaling relation for the freezing time: t_\text{final}\sim18.02 S t e^{-0.91}{ Re }^{-0.12} (D / W)^{1.42} . The results demonstrates that increasing Stefan number and Reynolds number shortens the freezing time, whereas increasing droplet D/W ratio extends it. Furthermore, the fitted coefficients reveals that temperature and droplet size exert a more pronounced influence on droplet freezing. Our results demonstrate good consistency with those in the literature, while indeed incorporating the effects of motion, which represents a novel aspect.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws, a new class of group invariant solutions, and its applications for the Whitham Broer Kaup model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Whitham Broer Kaup (WBK) equations provide a fundamental framework for modeling shallow water wave dynamics, effectively capturing both nonlinear and dispersive effects. In this study, we construct a new class of analytical and numerical solutions for the WBK system using Lie symmetry analysis. By determining an optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras, we obtain symmetry reductions that lead to new kinds of exact wave solutions expressed in hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational forms. The influence of key physical parameters on wave structure is systematically explored, revealing their role in shaping the velocity and surface profiles of the waves. An important aspect of this work is the application of the WBK model to tsunami wave propagation, demonstrating its capability to simulate the generation, evolution, and spatial spreading of long surface waves in coastal regions. This highlights the practical relevance of the WBK equations in geophysical and oceanographic contexts. Additionally, employing the direct multiplier method, we derive a complete set of local conservation laws for the governing WBK model, ensuring the preservation of key physical properties. These findings enhance the understanding of shallow water wave behavior, unify existing research, and provide a framework for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Natural Convection Dynamics in Open-Ended Vertical Channels with Different Aspect Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the thermal and flow fields associated with natural convection is of great importance in the design and manufacture of passive cooling systems, solar collectors, and ventilation systems. The aim of this study is to numerically investigate the naturally driven flow behaviour in open-ended vertical channels. Specifically, laminar airflow (Rayleigh number of 5*10^5) is naturally driven through a vertical channel that is asymmetrically heated with a uniform heat flux of (2043 w/m^2) . The compressible OpenFOAM solver (buoyantPimpleFoam) is employed, and open boundary conditions are applied at both the inlet and outlet to account for the effect of ventilation. The results exhibit good agreement with a numerical benchmark. Furthermore, a study of the airflow through two vertical channels, with two different aspect ratios of 5 and 31.25, is conducted. The results indicate that, in both cases of aspect ratios, the flow accelerates near the heated wall and decelerates near the adiabatic wall, forming a near-constant velocity region around the channel centreline. Increasing the aspect ratio diminishes the reverse flow. However, the flow pattern near the heated wall remains largely unaffected by aspect ratio changes. Additionally, the fluid behaviour downstream significantly affects velocity measurements at the inlet.</description>

      <title>A second-order particle Fokker-Planck-Master method for diatomic gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is widely used to describe rarefied gas flows. The DSMC method accounts for the transport and collisions of computational particles, resulting in higher computational costs in the continuum regime. The Fokker-Planck (FP) model approximates particle collisions as Brownian motion to reduce computational cost. Advanced FP models have been developed to enhance physical fidelity, ensuring the correct Prandtl number and the H-theorem. The FP model has further been extended to handle diatomic gases, such as the Fokker-Planck-Master (FPM) model. Alongside these developments in modeling, computational efficiency has also been improved by achieving second-order spatial and temporal accuracy, as demonstrated in the unified stochastic particle FP (USP-FP) method. However, these accuracy improvements have not yet been extended to diatomic gases, which are essential for engineering applications such as atmospheric reentry. This study proposes a unified stochastic particle Fokker-Planck-Master (USP-FPM) method for diatomic gases that achieves second-order accuracy in both time and space. Temporal accuracy is enhanced by reproducing second-order energy, viscous stress, and heat flux relaxations. Spatial accuracy is improved by employing a first-order polynomial reconstruction method. Three test cases are investigated: homogeneous relaxation, Poiseuille flow, and hypersonic flow around a cylinder. The results show that the USP-FPM method provides accurate solutions even with coarser cell sizes and larger time steps compared to the DSMC and FPM methods. In particular, for the hypersonic flow around a cylinder, the USP-FPM method achieves a speed-up factor of 28 compared to the DSMC method, while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>LinguaFluid: Language Guided Fluid Control via Semantic Rewards in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.</description>

      <title>Flexible floaters align with the direction of wave propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the slow, second order motion of thin flexible floating strips drifting in surface gravity waves. We introduce a diffractionless model (Froude-Krylov approximation) that neglects viscosity, surface tension, and radiation effects. This model predicts a mean yaw moment that favors a longitudinal orientation of the strip, along the direction of wave propagation. The physical mechanism for this angular drift is analog to that of the standard linear Stokes drift: it originates from a slight imbalance between the stronger acceleration on the wave crests (that favors the longitudinal orientation) and the wave troughs (that favors the transverse orientation). Laboratory experiments with thin rectangular strips of polypropylene show a systematic rotation of the strips toward the longitudinal orientation, in good agreement with our model. We finally observe that the mean angular velocity toward the stable longitudinal orientation decreases as the strip length increases, an effect likely due to dissipation, which is not accounted for in our inviscid model.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Ship Motion Prediction Capabilities of the Open-Source Model NEMOH Against Field Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate ship motion prediction is critical for safe and efficient maritime operations, particularly in open ocean environments. This study evaluates the capability of NEMOH, an open-source potential flow boundary element solver, as an example of a ship motion prediction tool for real-world open ocean conditions. A linear model, known as the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO), is obtained using NEMOH, and is combined with the wave directional spectrum derived from the WaMoS-II marine radar on the research vessel Akademik Tryoshnikov during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) to predict ship motion responses in the frequency domain. Predictions of heave, pitch and roll are benchmarked against concurrent ship motion observations recorded by an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU). The comparisons, based on the zeroth order moment of the ship motion spectrum, demonstrate a reliable heave prediction (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.89, scatter index SI=0.41), a reasonable pitch prediction (r=0.80, SI=0.47), and an acceptable roll prediction (r=0.63, SI=0.84). More significant discrepancies for pitch and roll are identified under specific extreme sea conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of NEMOH, offering insights into its applicability for real-world maritime operations.</description>

      <title>Active biphasic heat transfer enhancement in vertical natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical natural convection (VC), often cannot meet the high heat transfer demands due to the inherent misalignment of the direction of buoyancy (vertical) with the direction of the heat transfer (horizontal). Here we applied a novel strategy on a water based VC system to enhance the heat transfer. By adding 2% of the total volume with a low-boiling-temperature liquid (HFE-7000) and introducing a gas-liquid layer on top of the VC cell, we create a self-sustained state of pseudo-turbulence with evaporating, circulating and condensing biphasic bubbles. The system achieves 246% heat transfer enhancement at constant superheat $T_{sup}\approx6.4 \text{K}$ when the liquid in the full nucleate boiling state. Using shadowgraphy and Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) methods, we validate that the bubbles and biphasic particles induced agitation enhances the heat flux and modifies the temperature field of the heat transfer.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new robust formulation for local correlation-based laminar-to-turbulent transition models. This mechanism is incorporated into Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, coupled with the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model, considering both $\gamma$ and $\gamma$-${\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}_{\theta,t}}$ transition frameworks. In this context, special attention is placed on numerical stabilization of the $\gamma$ transport equation, which is identified as the root cause of instabilities observed in both $\gamma$ and $\gamma$-${\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}_{\theta,t}}$ based models. To this end, the intermittency equation is reformulated in logarithmic form and further stabilized through an energy--based limiting to bound excessively high positive values. In order to suppress unphysical pressure oscillations in the transition region, a gradient-driven artificial viscosity is also introduced. Additionally, the SA equation is augmented with strain-rate modulated production and rotation correction terms. The presented approach has demonstrated consistent effectiveness and robustness in the simulation of flow fields around airfoils over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, making it suitable for practical aerodynamic design applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>
