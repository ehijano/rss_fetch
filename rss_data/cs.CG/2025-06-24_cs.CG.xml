      <title>Optimal Parallel Algorithms for Convex Hulls in 2D and 3D under Noisy Primitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy primitives model, each primitive comparison performed by an algorithm, e.g., testing whether one value is greater than another, returns the incorrect answer with random, independent probability p &lt; 1/2 and otherwise returns a correct answer. This model was first applied in the context of sorting and searching, and recent work by Eppstein, Goodrich, and Sridhar extends this model to sequential algorithms involving geometric primitives such as orientation and sidedness tests. However, their approaches appear to be inherently sequential; hence, in this paper, we study parallel computational geometry algorithms for 2D and 3D convex hulls in the noisy primitives model. We give the first optimal parallel algorithms in the noisy primitives model for 2D and 3D convex hulls in the CREW PRAM model. The main technical contribution of our work concerns our ability to detect and fix errors during intermediate steps of our algorithm using a generalization of the failure sweeping technique.</description>

      <title>Continuous Map Matching to Paths under Travel Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of map matching with travel time constraints. Given a sequence of $k$ spatio-temporal measurements and an embedded path graph with travel time costs, the goal is to snap each measurement to a close-by location in the graph, such that consecutive locations can be reached from one another along the path within the timestamp difference of the respective measurements. This problem arises in public transit data processing as well as in map matching of movement trajectories to general graphs. We show that the classical approach for this problem, which relies on selecting a finite set of candidate locations in the graph for each measurement, cannot guarantee to find a consistent solution. We propose a new algorithm that can deal with an infinite set of candidate locations per measurement. We prove that our algorithm always detects a consistent map matching path (if one exists). Despite the enlarged candidate set, we also demonstrate that our algorithm has superior running time in theory and practice. For a path graph with $n$ nodes, we show that our algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n \log {nk})$ and under mild assumptions in $\mathcal{O}(k n ^\lambda + n \log^3 n)$ for $\lambda \approx 0.695$. This is a significant improvement over the baseline, which runs in $\mathcal{O}(k n^2)$ and which might not even identify a correct solution. The performance of our algorithm hinges on an efficient segment-circle intersection data structure. We describe how to design and implement such a data structure for our application. In the experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the usefulness of our novel algorithm on a diverse set of generated measurements as well as GTFS data.</description>

      <title>StoryGem: Voronoi treemap Approach for Semantics-Preserving Text Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Word cloud use is a popular text visualization technique that scales font sizes based on word frequencies within a defined spatial layout. However, traditional word clouds disregard semantic relationships between words, arranging them without considering their meanings. Semantic word clouds improved on this by positioning related words in proximity; however, still struggled with efficient space use and representing frequencies through font size variations, which can be misleading because of word length differences. This paper proposes StoryGem, a novel text visualization approach that addresses these limitations. StoryGem constructs a semantic word network from input text data, performs hierarchical clustering, and displays the results in a Voronoi treemap. Furthermore, this paper proposes an optimization problem to maximize the font size within the regions of a Voronoi treemap. In StoryGem, word frequencies map to area sizes rather than font sizes, allowing flexible text sizing that maximizes use of each region's space. This mitigates bias from varying word lengths affecting font size perception. StoryGem strikes a balance between a semantic organization and spatial efficiency, combining the strengths of word clouds and treemaps. Through hierarchical clustering of semantic word networks, it captures word semantics and relationships. The Voronoi treemap layout facilitates gapless visualization, with area sizes corresponding to frequencies for clearer representation. User study across diverse text datasets demonstrate StoryGem's potential as an effective technique for quickly grasping textual content and semantic structures.</description>

      <title>How Hard is it to be a Star? Convex Geometry and the Real Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set is star-shaped if there is a point in the set that can see every other point in the set in the sense that the line-segment connecting the points lies within the set. We show that testing whether a non-empty compact smooth region is star-shaped is $\forall\mathbb{R}$-complete. Since the obvious definition of star-shapedness has logical form $\exists\forall$, this is a somewhat surprising result, based on Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}'s theorem from convex geometry; we study several related complexity classifications in the real hierarchy based on other results from convex geometry.</description>

      <title>TDACloud: Point Cloud Recognition Using Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated, or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the baselines by up to approximately 14%.</description>

      <title>Universal Solvability for Robot Motion Planning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR) problem: given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and p robots, determine whether any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E), achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| + |E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on a and b.</description>

      <title>Local Averaging Accurately Distills Manifold Structure From Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional data are ubiquitous, with examples ranging from natural images to scientific datasets, and often reside near low-dimensional manifolds. Leveraging this geometric structure is vital for downstream tasks, including signal denoising, reconstruction, and generation. However, in practice, the manifold is typically unknown and only noisy samples are available. A fundamental approach to uncovering the manifold structure is local averaging, which is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art provable methods for manifold fitting and denoising. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no works that rigorously analyze the accuracy of local averaging in a manifold setting in high-noise regimes. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses of a two-round mini-batch local averaging method applied to noisy samples drawn from a $d$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$, under a relatively high-noise regime where the noise size is comparable to the reach $\tau$. We show that with high probability, the averaged point $\hat{\mathbf q}$ achieves the bound $d(\hat{\mathbf q}, \mathcal M) \leq \sigma \sqrt{d\left(1+\frac{\kappa\mathrm{diam}(\mathcal {M})}{\log(D)}\right)}$, where $\sigma, \mathrm{diam(\mathcal M)},\kappa$ denote the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise, manifold's diameter and a bound on its extrinsic curvature, respectively. This is the first analysis of local averaging accuracy over the manifold in the relatively high noise regime where $\sigma \sqrt{D} \approx \tau$. The proposed method can serve as a preprocessing step for a wide range of provable methods designed for lower-noise regimes. Additionally, our framework can provide a theoretical foundation for a broad spectrum of denoising and dimensionality reduction methods that rely on local averaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Computing Betti tables and minimal presentations of zero-dimensional persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Betti tables of a multigraded module encode the grades at which there is an algebraic change in the module. Multigraded modules show up in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, and in particular in topological data analysis, where they are known as persistence modules, and where their Betti tables describe the places at which the homology of filtered simplicial complexes changes. Although Betti tables of singly and bigraded modules are already being used in applications of topological data analysis, their computation in the bigraded case (which relies on an algorithm that is cubic in the size of the filtered simplicial complex) is a bottleneck when working with large datasets. We show that, in the special case of zero-dimensional homology (relevant for clustering and graph classification) Betti tables of bigraded modules can be computed in log-linear time. We also consider the problem of computing minimal presentations, and show that minimal presentations of zero-dimensional persistent homology can be computed in quadratic time, regardless of the grading poset.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Arc Cover Problem and its Applications to Contiguous Art Gallery, Polygon Separation, and Shape Carving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the following problems are in $\textsf{P}$:
  1. The contiguous art gallery problem -- a variation of the art gallery problem where each guard can protect a contiguous interval along the boundary of a simple polygon. This was posed at the open problem session at CCCG '24 by Thomas C. Shermer.
  2. The polygon separation problem for line segments -- For two sets of line segments $S_1$ and $S_2$, find a minimum-vertex convex polygon $P$ that completely contains $S_1$ and does not contain or cross any segment of $S_2$.
  3. Minimizing the number of half-plane cuts to carve a 3D polytope.
  To accomplish this, we study the analytic arc cover problem -- an interval set cover problem over the unit circle with infinitely many implicitly-defined arcs, given by a function.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomy features. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. For post-MI women, the heart is positioned more posteriorly and vertically, than in men (with healthy women yet more vertical). Post-MI women exhibit less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS is associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women is striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women (but not in men). Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</description>
