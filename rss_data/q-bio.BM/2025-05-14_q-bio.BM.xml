      <title>High-throughput Screening of the Mechanical Properties of Peptide Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptides are recognized for their varied self-assembly behaviors, forming a wide array of structures and geometries, such as spheres, fibers, and hydrogels, each presenting a unique set of material properties. The functionalities of these materials hold exceptional interest for applications in biology, medicine, photonics, nanotechnology and the food industry. In specific, the ability to exploit peptides as viable and sustainable mechanical materials requires sequence design that enables superior performance, notably a high Young's modulus. As the peptide sequence space is vast, however, even a slight increase in sequence length leads to an exponential increase in the number of potential peptide sequences to be characterized. Here, we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, atomic force microscopy experiments and machine learning models to correlate the sequence length and composition with the mechanical properties of self-assembled peptides. We calculate the Young's modulus for all possible amino acid sequences of di- and tripeptides using high-throughput coarse-grained methods, and validate these calculations through in-situ mechanical characterization. For pentapeptides, we select and calculate properties for a subset of sequences to train a machine learning model, which allows us to predict the modulus for other sequences. The combined workflow not only identifies promising peptide candidates with exceptional mechanical performances, but also extends current understanding of the sequence-to-function relationships for peptide materials, for specific applications.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Review of RNA Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given usefulness of protein language models (LMs) in structure and functional inference, RNA LMs have received increased attentions in the last few years. However, these RNA models are often not compared against the same standard. Here, we divided RNA LMs into three classes (pretrained on multiple RNA types (especially noncoding RNAs), specific-purpose RNAs, and LMs that unify RNA with DNA or proteins or both) and compared 13 RNA LMs along with 3 DNA and 1 protein LMs as controls in zero-shot prediction of RNA secondary structure and functional classification. Results shows that the models doing well on secondary structure prediction often perform worse in function classification or vice versa, suggesting that more balanced unsupervised training is needed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Quantum Mechanics for Proteins (QMProt), a dataset developed to support quantum computing applications in protein research. QMProt contains precise quantum-mechanical and physicochemical data, enabling accurate characterization of biomolecules and supporting advanced computational methods like molecular fragmentation and reassembly. The dataset includes 45 molecules covering all 20 essential human amino acids and their core structural elements: amino terminal groups, carboxyl terminal groups, alpha carbons, and unique side chains. QMProt primarily features organic molecules with up to 15 non-hydrogen atoms (C, N, O, S), offering comprehensive molecular Hamiltonians, ground state energies, and detailed physicochemical properties. Publicly accessible, QMProt aims to enhance reproducibility and advance quantum-enhanced simulations in molecular biology, biochemistry, and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the potential energy surface for the conformational interconversion of the amyloid $\beta$ peptide at the fibril end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of amyloid fibrils comprising amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides is associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we theoretically investigated the A$\beta$ structure at the fibril end using the density functional theory calculation. Several twisted conformations were identified as local minima in which a part of the peptide chain bends upward while the rest remains bound to the lower A$\beta$ monomer. Fibril-to-twisted conformational transition exhibited endothermic behavior, with endothermic energy increasing as more backbone hydrogen bonds were broken. In addition, the loss of van der Waals interaction from the hydrophobic sidechain contributed to endothermicity. The nudged elastic band method was applied to analyze the potential energy surface connecting the fibril and twisted conformations. Comparison of the activation barriers between different twisted conformations revealed that certain twisted conformations returned relatively easily to the fibril conformation, whereas others encountered a higher activation barrier and reverted less readily. Detailed structural analysis revealed that the twisted conformation's propensity to return originates from the local steric hindrance imposed by the sidechain near the torsional axis.</description>

      <title>Fragment-Masked Diffusion for Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 985 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 95.4\%, with an average efficacy increase of 7.5\%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>

      <title>Graph-structured Small Molecule Drug Discovery Through Deep Learning: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their excellent drug-like and pharmacokinetic properties, small molecule drugs are widely used to treat various diseases, making them a critical component of drug discovery. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning (DL) techniques, DL-based small molecule drug discovery methods have achieved excellent performance in prediction accuracy, speed, and complex molecular relationship modeling compared to traditional machine learning approaches. These advancements enhance drug screening efficiency and optimization and provide more precise and effective solutions for various drug discovery tasks. Contributing to this field's development, this paper aims to systematically summarize and generalize the recent key tasks and representative techniques in graph-structured small molecule drug discovery in recent years. Specifically, we provide an overview of the major tasks in small molecule drug discovery and their interrelationships. Next, we analyze the six core tasks, summarizing the related methods, commonly used datasets, and technological development trends. Finally, we discuss key challenges, such as interpretability and out-of-distribution generalization, and offer our insights into future research directions for small molecule drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching for Controllable Biological Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing biological sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, functional and biophysical criteria remains a central challenge in biomolecule engineering. While discrete flow matching models have recently shown promise for efficient sampling in high-dimensional sequence spaces, existing approaches address only single objectives or require continuous embeddings that can distort discrete distributions. We present Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching (MOG-DFM), a general framework to steer any pretrained discrete flow matching generator toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs across multiple scalar objectives. At each sampling step, MOG-DFM computes a hybrid rank-directional score for candidate transitions and applies an adaptive hypercone filter to enforce consistent multi-objective progression. We also trained two unconditional discrete flow matching models, PepDFM for diverse peptide generation and EnhancerDFM for functional enhancer DNA generation, as base generation models for MOG-DFM. We demonstrate MOG-DFM's effectiveness in generating peptide binders optimized across five properties (hemolysis, non-fouling, solubility, half-life, and binding affinity), and in designing DNA sequences with specific enhancer classes and DNA shapes. In total, MOG-DFM proves to be a powerful tool for multi-property-guided biomolecule sequence design.</description>
