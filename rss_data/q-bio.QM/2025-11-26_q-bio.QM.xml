      <title>Masked Autoencoder Joint Learning for Robust Spitzoid Tumor Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of spitzoid tumors (ST) is critical to ensure a favorable prognosis and to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Epigenetic data, particularly DNA methylation, provide a valuable source of information for this task. However, prior studies assume complete data, an unrealistic setting as methylation profiles frequently contain missing entries due to limited coverage and experimental artifacts. Our work challenges these favorable scenarios and introduces ReMAC, an extension of ReMasker designed to tackle classification tasks on high-dimensional data under complete and incomplete regimes. Evaluation on real clinical data demonstrates that ReMAC achieves strong and robust performance compared to competing classification methods in the stratification of ST. Code is available: https://github.com/roshni-mahtani/ReMAC.</description>

      <title>Parallelism in Neurodegenerative Biomarker Tests: Hidden Errors and the Risk of Misconduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomarkers are critical tools in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. Reliable quantification depends on assay validity, especially the demonstration of parallelism between diluted biological samples and the assay's standard curve. Inadequate parallelism can lead to biased concentration estimates, jeopardizing both clinical and research applications. Here we systematically review the evidence of analytical parallelism in body fluid (serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid) biomarker assays for neurodegeneration and evaluate the extent, reproducibility, and reporting quality of partial parallelism.
  This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024568766) and conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We included studies published between December 2010 to July 2024 without language restrictions. ...
  In conclusion, partial parallelism was infrequently observed and inconsistently reported in most biomarker assays for neurodegeneration. Narrow dilution ranges and variable methodologies limit generalizability. Transparent reporting of dilution protocols and adherence to established analytical validation guidelines is needed. This systematic review has practical implications for clinical trial design, regulatory approval processes, and the reliability of biomarker-based diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Blini: lightweight nucleotide sequence search and dereplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blini is a tool for quick lookup of nucleotide sequences in databases, and for quick dereplication of sequence collections. It is meant to help clean and characterize large collections of assembled contigs or long sequences that would otherwise be too big to search with online tools, or too demanding for a local machine to process. Benchmarks on simulated data demonstrate that it is faster than existing tools and requires less RAM, while preserving search and clustering accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spanning Tree Basis for Unbiased Averaging of Network Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been a paradigm shift from the study of local task-related activation to the organization and functioning of large-scale functional and structural brain networks. However, a long-standing challenge in this large-scale brain network analysis is how to compare network organizations irrespective of their complexity. The maximum spanning tree (MST) has served as a simple, unbiased, standardized representation of complex brain networks and effectively addressed this long-standing challenge. This tree representation, however, has been limited to individual networks. Group-level trees are always constructed from the average network or through a bootstrap procedure. Constructing the group-level tree from the average network introduces bias from individual subjects with outlying connectivities. The bootstrap method can be computationally prohibitive if a good approximation is desired. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral representation of trees using the spanning tree basis. This spectral representation enables us to compute the average MST and demonstrate that this average tree captures the global properties of all the MSTs in the group and also overlaps with the union of the shortest paths in the functional brain networks.</description>

      <title>Mechano-chemical modeling of glia initiated secondary injury of neurons under mechanical load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) results from an impact or concussion to the head with the injury being specifically characterized through pathological degradation at various biological length scales. Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions. This framework is an attempt to quantify secondary injury and thus assist in developing targeted TBI treatments.</description>

      <title>Development of a fully deep learning model to improve the reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives. The aim of the present study was to develop a fully deep learning model to reduce the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction. Methods. Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p&gt;0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion. AI models can be designed to automatically classify the position of unerupted maxillary canines.</description>

      <title>Mamba-based Deep Learning Approach for Sleep Staging on a Wireless Multimodal Wearable System without Electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Study Objectives: We investigate a Mamba-based deep learning approach for sleep staging on signals from ANNE One (Sibel Health, Evanston, IL), a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography (ECG), triaxial accelerometry, and chest temperature, and finger photoplethysmography and finger temperature.
  Methods: We obtained wearable sensor recordings from 357 adults undergoing concurrent polysomnography (PSG) at a tertiary care sleep lab. Each PSG recording was manually scored and these annotations served as ground truth labels for training and evaluation of our models. PSG and wearable sensor data were automatically aligned using their ECG channels with manual confirmation by visual inspection. We trained a Mamba-based recurrent neural network architecture on these recordings. Ensembling of model variants with similar architectures was performed.
  Results: After ensembling, the model attains a 3-class (wake, non rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep, rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) balanced accuracy of 84.02%, F1 score of 84.23%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 72.89%, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) score of 73.00%; a 4-class (wake, light NREM [N1/N2], deep NREM [N3], REM) balanced accuracy of 75.30%, F1 score of 74.10%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 61.51%, and MCC score of 61.95%; a 5-class (wake, N1, N2, N3, REM) balanced accuracy of 65.11%, F1 score of 66.15%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 53.23%, MCC score of 54.38%.
  Conclusions: Our Mamba-based deep learning model can successfully infer major sleep stages from the ANNE One, a wearable system without electroencephalography (EEG), and can be applied to data from adults attending a tertiary care sleep clinic.</description>

      <title>CORE -- A Cell-Level Coarse-to-Fine Image Registration Engine for Multi-stain Image Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</description>

      <title>Explainable deep learning framework for cancer therapeutic target prioritization leveraging PPI centrality and node embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed an explainable deep learning framework integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) network centrality metrics with node embeddings for cancer therapeutic target prioritization. A high-confidence PPI network was constructed from STRING database interactions, computing six centrality metrics: degree, strength, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient. Node2Vec embeddings captured latent network topology. Combined features trained XGBoost and neural network classifiers using DepMap CRISPR essentiality scores as ground truth. Model interpretability was assessed through GradientSHAP analysis quantifying feature contributions. We developed a novel blended scoring approach combining model probability predictions with SHAP attribution magnitudes for enhanced gene prioritization. Our framework achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUROC of 0.930 and AUPRC of 0.656 for identifying the top 10\% most essential genes. GradientSHAP analysis revealed centrality measures contributed significantly to predictions, with degree centrality showing strongest correlation ($\rho$ = -0.357) with gene essentiality. The blended scoring approach created robust gene prioritization rankings, successfully identifying known essential genes including ribosomal proteins (RPS27A, RPS17, RPS6) and oncogenes (MYC). This study presents a human-based, combinatorial in silico framework successfully integrating network biology with explainable AI for therapeutic target discovery. The framework provides mechanistic transparency through feature attribution analysis while maintaining state-of-the-art predictive performance. Its reproducible design and reliance on human molecular datasets demonstrate a reduction-to-practice example of next-generation, animal-free modeling for cancer therapeutic target discovery and prioritization.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic causal network of seagrass-bacteria-algae-diatoms interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seagrass meadows contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems, reduction in global warming impacts and pathogen controls. However, the decline in seagrass habitats due to environmental loads has become an urgent global issue. One way to address this issue is to better understand healthy seagrass habitats. Here, we estimate the structural characteristics of symbiotic and metabolic systems in sediments from eight coastal regions of Japan, with each region containing both seagrass-covered areas and adjacent unvegetated areas. Notably, seagrasses commonly maintain a balanced symbiotic relationship characterized by a positive association with cable bacteria (Desulfobulbaceae), nitrogen-cycling bacteria (Hyphomonadaceae), and coral algae (Corallinophycidae) and a negative association with diatoms (Diatomea). Furthermore, seagrass growth conditions influence metabolic pathways by activating nitrogen-related metabolism while attenuating methanogenesis. Our findings highlight the crucial roles of marine plants and their symbiotic systems in ensuring environmental conservation within the context of blue carbon storage across environmental gradients.</description>
