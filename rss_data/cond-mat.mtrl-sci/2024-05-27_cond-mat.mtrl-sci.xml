      <title>Studies of Ni-Cr complexation in FLiBe molten salt using machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nuclear and/or solar applications that involve molten salts, impurities frequently enter the salt as either fission products or via corrosion. Impurities can interact and make complexes, but the impact of such complexation on the properties of the salts and corrosion rates has not been understood. Common impurities in molten salts, such as FLiBe, include Cr, Ni, and Fe. Here, we investigate the complexation of Cr and Ni in FLiBe using molecular dynamics based on a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) fitted using the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) method. The MLIP allows us to overcome the challenges of simultaneously needing accurate energetics and long time scale to study complexation. We demonstrate that impurity behavior is more difficult to capture than that of concentrated elements with MLIPs due to less sampling in training data, but that this can be overcome by using active learning strategies to obtain a robust fit. Our findings suggest that there is a weak but potentially significant binding free energy between CrF2 and NiF2 in eutectic FLiBe of -0.112 eV. Under certain conditions this binding creates a significant short-range order between the species and lowers the redox potential of NiF2 in the presence of CrF2 in FLiBe, making Ni dissolution more favorable in the presence of Cr as compared to its dissolution in pure FLiBe. However, we find little impact of this complexation on the diffusivity of Ni and Cr. Overall, the methodology presented here suggests an approach to modeling complexation with MLIPs and suggests that interactions between dissolved cations could be playing a significant role in some salt thermophysical properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic single wall CrI3 nanotubes encapsulated within multiwall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrI3 is a layered ferromagnetic insulator that has recently attracted enormous interest as it was the first example of a stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, paving the way towards the study of two-dimensional magnetic materials and their use as building blocks of hybrid van der Waals layered heterostructures. Here we go one step down in the dimensionality ladder and report the synthesis and characterization of a tubular one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure where CrI3 nanotubes are encapsulated within multiwall carbon nanotubes, integrating a magnetic insulator and a conductor. By means of the capillary filling of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), we obtained single-wall CrI3 nanotubes with diameters ranging between 2 nm and 10 nm, with an average of 5.3 nm. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy in combination with spectroscopic techniques we confirm the structure and chemical composition of the nanotubes. SQUID measurements, combined with element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) indicate unequivocally that the Cr atoms in encapsulated CrI3 nanotubes are magnetic with a collective state compatible with a radial magnetization state predicted both by first-principles calculations and a model Hamiltonian. Our results represent a step forward in establishing 1D van der Waals heterostructures as a playground for the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states arising from the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and curvature in tubular geometries.</description>

      <title>Critical Assessment of Mass and Lattice Disorder in Thermal Conductivity Prediction for Medium and High Entropy Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium and high entropy ceramics, with their distinctive disordered structures, exhibit ultra-low thermal conductivity and high temperature stability. These properties make them strong contenders for next generation thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials. However, predicting their thermal conductivity has been challenging, primarily due to their unique phonon scattering mechanisms. Apart from the conventional phonon-phonon scattering mechanism, the phonon-disorder scattering, comprising both mass and force constant disorder, are also expected to make significant contribution in determining the thermal conductivity of medium and high entropy ceramics. However, it remains challenging to quantify the phonon-disorder contribution, particular in the aspect of force constant disorder. Here we demonstrated a relationship between the lattice disorder, a quantity more readily calculable, with force constant disorder, rendering it possible to substitute the force constant disorder by lattice disorder. Based on this relationship and drawing inspiration from Klement's equation of static imperfection, we have developed a model that quantitatively assesses the connection between disorder and thermal conductivity. Applying our model to the medium/high entropy rocksalt and pyrochlore oxides as representatives, we found good alignment between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of thermal conductivities, confirming the validity of our model. The model developed offers a critical predictive tool for rapid screening of TBC materials based on medium and high entropy ceramics.</description>

      <title>Computational toolkit for predicting thickness of 2D materials using machine learning and autogenerated dataset by large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thickness of 2D materials not only plays a crucial role in determining the performance of nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices but also introduces complexities in predicting volume-dependent properties such as energy storage capacity, due to the intrinsic vacuum within these materials. Although a plethora of experimental techniques, including but not limited to optical contrast, Raman spectroscopy, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, near-field optical imaging, and hyperspectral imaging, facilitate the measurement of 2D material thickness, comprehensive data for many materials remains elusive. Over the last decade, the exponential proliferation of 2D materials and their heterostructures has outstripped the capabilities of conventional experimental and computational approaches. In this evolving landscape, machine learning (ML) has emerged as an indispensable tool, offering novel avenues to augment these traditional methodologies. Addressing the critical gap, we introduce THICK2D - Thickness Hierarchy Inference and Calculation Kit for 2D Materials. This Python-based computational framework harnesses an autogenerated thickness database, developed using large language models (LLMs), and advanced ML algorithms to facilitate the rapid and scalable estimation of material thickness, relying solely on crystallographic data. To demonstrate the utility and robustness of THICK2D, we successfully employed the toolkit to predict the thickness of more than 8000 2D-based materials, sourced from two extensive 2D material databases. THICK2D is disseminated as an open-source utility, accessible on GitHub https://github.com/gmp007/THICK2D, and archived on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11216648}{10.5281/zenodo.11216648.</description>

      <title>Procedural Construction of Atomistic Polyurethane Block Copolymer Models for High Throughput Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, methods are presented to automatically generate a fully atomistic LAMMPS models of arbitrary linear multiblock polyurethane copolymers. The routine detailed here receives as parameters the number of repeat units per hard block, the number of units in a soft block, and the number of soft blocks per chain, as well as chemical formulae of three monomers which will form the hard component, soft component, and chain extender. A routine is detailed for converting the chemical structure of a free monomer to the urethane bonded repeat units in a polymer. The python package RadonPy is leveraged to assemble these units into blocks, and the blocks into copolymers. Care is taken in this work to ensure that plausible atomic charges are assigned to repeat units in different parts of the chain. The static structure factor is calculated for a variety of chemistries, and the results compared with wide angle x-ray scattering data from experiments with corresponding composition. The generated models reproduce the amorphous halo observed in the scattering data as well as some of the finer details. Structure factor calculations are decomposed into the partial structure factors to interrogate the structural properties of the two block types separately. Parametric surveys are carried out of the effects of various parameters, including temperature, soft block length, and block connectivity on the observed structure. The routine detailed here for constructing models is robust enough to be executed automatically in a high throughput workflow for material design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Electric Polarization and Magnetic Properties of (NH$_4$)$_{1-x}$K$_x$I (x = 0.05-0.17)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While all of the polymorphs of pure NH$_4$I and KI are non-polar, we identify that (NH$_4$)$_{0.95}$K$_{0.05}$I is ferroelectric and (NH$_4$)$_{0.87}$K$_{0.13}$I and (NH$_4$)$_{0.83}$K$_{0.17}$I are pyroelectric through measurements of their pyroelectric current and complex dielectric constant. The order to disorder phase transitions occur near 245 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that the proton orbitals of the NH$_4$$^+$ continue to become ordered in the ground state in the (NH$_4$)$_{1-x}$K$_x$I system up to x &lt;= 0.17. The polar phases are proposed to stem from K$^+$ ions disrupting the symmetry of proton-orbital-lattice interactions between the NH$_4$$^+$ and I$^-$ ions. Our work introduces a new pathway for the ordered phases of ammonium-based compounds to potentially become ferroelectric.</description>

      <title>Inducing ferroelectricity in NH$_4$I and NH$_4$Br via partial replacement of protons by deuterons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While all of the polymorphs of NH$_4$I and NH$_4$Br are non-polar, a reversible electric polarization is established in the ordered $\gamma$ phases of (NH$_4$)$_{0.73}$(ND$_4$)$_{0.27}$I and (NH$_4$)$_{0.84}$(ND$_4$)$_{0.16}$Br (where D is $^2$H) via $dc$ electric fields. The presence of two groups of orbital magnetic moments appears to be responsible for the asymmetric lattice distortions. Our findings provide an alternative pathway for hydrogen-based materials to potentially add a ferroelectric functionality.</description>

      <title>Optical study of the charge dynamics evolution in the topological insulators MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and Mn(Bi$_{0.74}$Sb$_{0.26}$)$_2$Te$_4$ under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The van der Waals material MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and the related Sb-substituted compounds Mn(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_4$ are prominent members of the family of magnetic topological insulators, in which rare quantum mechanical states can be realized. In this work, we study the evolution of the charge dynamics in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and the Sb-substituted compound Mn(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_4$ with $x=0.26$ under hydrostatic pressure. For MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the pressure dependence of the screened plasma frequency, the dc conductivity, and the reflectance at selected frequencies shows weak anomalies at $\sim$2 and $\sim$4~GPa, which might be related to an electronic phase transition driven by the enhanced interlayer interaction. We observe a pressure-induced decrease in the optical gap, consistent with the decrease in and closing of the energy gap reported in the literature. Both studied materials show an unusual decrease in the low-energy optical conductivity under pressure, which we attribute to a decreasing spectral weight of the Drude terms describing the free charge carrier excitations. Our results suggest a localization of conduction electrons under pressure, possibly due to hybridization effects.</description>

      <title>Question Answering models for information extraction from perovskite materials science literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific text is a promising source of data in materials science, with ongoing research into utilising textual data for materials discovery. In this study, we developed and tested a novel approach to extract material-property relationships from scientific publications using the Question Answering (QA) method. QA performance was evaluated for information extraction of perovskite bandgaps based on a human query. We observed considerable variation in results with five different large language models fine-tuned for the QA task. Best extraction accuracy was achieved with the QA MatBERT and F1-scores improved on the current state-of-the-art. This work demonstrates the QA workflow and paves the way towards further applications. The simplicity, versatility and accuracy of the QA approach all point to its considerable potential for text-driven discoveries in materials research.</description>

      <title>High-field magnetoelectric coupling and successive magnetic transitions in Mn-doped polar antiferromagnet Ni3TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the 3d transition metal ions doped polar Ni3TeO6, Mn-doped Ni3TeO6 has stimulated great interest due to its high magnetic ordering temperature and complex magnetic phases, but the mechanism of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling is far from understood. Herein we report our systematic investigation of the chemical control of magnetism, metamagnetic transition, and ME properties of Ni3-xMnxTeO6 single crystals in high magnetic field (H) up to 52 T. We present a previously unreported weak ferromagnetic behavior appeared in the ab plane below 9.5 K in addition to the incommensurate helical and commensurate collinear antiferromagnetic states. In the low-field region, a spin-flop type metamagnetic transition without any hysteresis occurs at Hc1 for H // c, while another metamagnetic transition accompanied with a change in electric polarization is observed at Hc2 in the high-field region both for H // c and H // ab above 30 K, which can be attributed to the sudden rotation of magnetic moments at Ni2 sites. The ME measurements reveal that a first-order ME effect is observed in the low-T and low-H regions, while a second-order ME coupling term appears above 30 K in the magnetic field range of Hc1 &lt; H &lt; Hc2 for H // c and H &lt; Hc2 for H // ab, both becoming significant with increasing temperature. Eventually, they are dominated by the second-order ME effect near the antiferromagnetic transition temperature. The present work demonstrates that Ni3-xMnxTeO6 is an exotic magnetoelectric material compared with Ni3TeO6 and its derivatives, thereby providing insights to better understand the magnetism and ME coupling in Ni3TeO6 and its derivatives.</description>

      <title>The paramagnetic Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we derive an expression for magnetic dipole transitions that is analogous to the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation for dielectric polar lattice vibrations. We thereby define transverse and longitudinal optical frequencies at which paramagnetic resonance and antiresonance occurs, respectively. The relation found here thus permits non-invasive optical analysis of static magnetization properties in paramagnetic materials. Validated through terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance ellipsometry and superconducting quantum interference device measurements on Iron-doped Gallium Nitride, our findings show very good agreement between theory and experiment. We term the excitations associated with the paramagnetic transitions as paramagnetic polaritons which may find use in future photonic applications</description>

      <title>Short range order and topology of Te-rich amorphous Ge-Sb-Te alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of evaporated amorphous Ge$_x$Sb$_x$Te$_{100-2x}$ ($x =$ 6, 9, 13) alloys was investigated by neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) at the Ge, Sb and Te K-edges. Large scale structural models were generated by fitting the experimental datasets (5 for each composition) simultaneously in the framework of the reverse Monte Carlo simulation technique. It was found that the alloys are chemically ordered (Ge and Sb have predominantly Te neighbors) and within the experimental uncertainty each component satisfies the $8-N$ rule. A comparison with the pair correlation functions of melt quenched Ge$_{20}$Te$_{80}$ revealed that the first minimum of $g_{\mathrm{TeTe}}(r)$ is shallower in the ternary alloys than in Ge$_{20}$Te$_{80}$. On the other hand, the separation of the first and second coordination environments of Ge atoms is stronger in the Ge-Sb-Te alloys investigated.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deep Neural Network Approach To Solve Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems poses a significant challenge in physics due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space with the number of particles. Traditional methods often struggle with large system sizes and frustrated lattices. In this research article, we present a novel algorithm that leverages the power of deep neural networks combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to address these limitations. Our method introduces a neural network architecture specifically designed to represent bosonic quantum states on a 1D lattice chain. We successfully achieve the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating the superiority of the adaptive momentum optimizer for convergence speed and stability. Notably, our approach offers flexibility in simulating various lattice geometries and potentially larger system sizes, making it a valuable tool for exploring complex quantum phenomena. This work represents a substantial advancement in the field of quantum simulation, opening new possibilities for investigating previously challenging systems.</description>

      <title>Absence of Long-Range Magnetic Ordering in a Trirutile High-Entropy Oxide (Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2)Ta2O6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionalities of solid-state materials are usually considered to be dependent on their crystal structures. The limited structural types observed in the emerged high-entropy oxides put constraints on exploration of their physical properties and potential applications. Herein, we synthesized the first high-entropy oxide in a trirutile structure, (Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2)Ta2O6, and investigated its magnetism. The phase purity and high-entropy nature were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated divalent Mn, Co and Cu along with coexistence of divalent and trivalent Fe and Ni. Magnetic properties measurements showed antiferromagnetic coupling and potential short-range magnetic ordering below ~ 4 K. The temperature-dependent heat capacity data measured under zero and high magnetic field confirmed the short-range magnetic ordering and a possible low-temperature phonon excitation. Moreover, the possible reasons for the absence of long-range magnetic ordering are concluded from a molecular orbital perspective. The discovery of the first trirutile high-entropy oxide opens a new way for studying the relationship between the highly disordered atomic arrangement and their magnetic interaction. Furthermore, it provides a new direction for exploring functionalities of high-entropy oxides.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deep Neural Network Approach To Solve Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for interacting many-body quantum systems faces computational challenges due to exponential scaling with system size. This complexity limits the study of important phenomena in materials science and physics. We develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-driven algorithm to simulate fermionic systems on lattices. Our method uses Pauli matrices to represent quantum states, incorporates Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and leverages an adaptive momentum optimizer. We demonstrate the algorithm's accuracy by simulating the Heisenberg Hamiltonian on a one-dimensional lattice, achieving results with an error in the order of $10^{-4}$ compared to exact diagonalization. Furthermore, we successfully model a magnetic phase transition in a two-dimensional lattice under an applied magnetic field. Importantly, our approach avoids the sign problem common to traditional Fermionic Monte Carlo methods, enabling the investigation of frustrated systems. This work demonstrates the potential of ANN-based algorithms for efficient simulation of complex quantum systems, opening avenues for discoveries in condensed matter physics and materials science.</description>

      <title>Ligand Field Exciton Annihilation in Bulk CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals material CrCl3 exhibits very strongly bound ligand field excitons that control optoelectronic applications and are connected with magnetic ordering by virtue of their d-orbital origin. Time-resolved photoluminescence of these exciton populations at room temperature shows that their relaxation is dominated by exciton-exciton annihilation and that the spontaneous decay lifetime is very long. These observations allow the rough quantification of the exciton annihilation rate constant and contextualization in light of a recent theory of universal scaling behavior of the annihilation process.</description>

      <title>Inductive detection of inverse spin-orbit torques in magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization via Magnetic torques is one of the most important phenomena in spintronics. In thin films, conventionally, a charge current flowing in a heavy metal is used to generate transverse spin currents and to exert torques on the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic thin film layer. Here, in contrast to the typically employed heavy metals, we study spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnetic heterostructures with large spin-orbit interaction that function as the torque-generating layers. In particular, we chose perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) multilayers [Co/Ni] and [Co/Pt] as the torque-generating layers and drive magnetization dynamics in metallic ferromagnetic thin film $\mathrm{Co_{20}Fe_{60}B_{20}}$ (CoFeB) layers with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). We investigate the spin dynamics driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) and the concomitant charge current generation by the inverse SOT process using an inductive technique based on a vector network analyzer. In our experimental findings, we find that the SOTs generated by our multilayers are of a magnitude comparable to those produced by Pt, consistent with first-principles calculations. Furthermore, we noted a significant correlation between the SOT and the thickness of the CoFeB layer.</description>

      <title>First-principles studies of fermiology in topological phases of bulk ZrTe$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators have been studied intensively over the last decades. Among these materials, three-dimensional (3D) zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe$_5$) stands out as one of the most intriguing for both theoretical and experimental studies because of its diverse range of distinct topological phases. In this work, we employ density functional theory to study the electronic structure and quantum oscillations exhibited by various topological phases of 3D bulk ZrTe$_5$. We have discovered that by analyzing combined patterns in band structures, Fermi surfaces, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations we can determine the corresponding topological phase without relying on the conventional calculation of topological invariants or boundary state contributions. This approach facilitates the identification of topological phases in ZrTe$_5$ directly from experimental quantum oscillation measurements. Using this method, we have analyzed the entire process of topological phase transition, revealing changes in the topology of the Fermi pockets and validating the shapes deduced from the experimental data for the topological phases.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Synchronization-Induced Patterns in Two-dimensional Magnetic Rod Systems under Rotating Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two-dimensional assemblies of rod-shaped magnetic colloids under the influence of an external rotating magnetic field. Using Molecular Dynamics, we simulate the formation of patterns that emerge based on the synchronization degree between the magnetic rods and the rotating field. We then explore the structural and dynamic characteristics of the resulting steady states, examining their evolution as a function of changes in the rods' aspect ratio, the strength of the external magnetic field, and its rotation frequency. Three distinct synchronization regimes of the rods with the magnetic field are clearly observed. A detailed set of phase diagrams illustrates the complex relationship between the magnitude of the external magnetic field and its rotation frequency and how these parameters govern the formation of unique self-organized structures.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at internal and twistronic twin boundaries of van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, rhombohedral MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarization, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that the introduction of a twist at the twinned interface, with a `magic' angle $\theta^* \approx 3^{\circ}$, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, due to commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density.</description>

      <title>Imaging topological polar structures in marginally twisted 2D semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moire superlattices formed in van der Waals heterostructures due to twisting, lattice mismatch and strain present an opportunity for creating novel metamaterials with unique properties not present in the individual layers themselves. Ferroelectricity for example, arises due to broken inversion symmetry in twisted and strained bilayers of 2D semiconductors with stacking domains of alternating out-of-plane polarization. However, understanding the individual contributions of twist and strain to the formation of topological polar nanostructures remains to be established and has proven to be experimentally challenging. Inversion symmetry breaking has been predicted to give rise to an in-plane component of polarization along the domain walls, leading to the formation of a network of topologically non-trivial merons (half-skyrmions) that are Bloch-type for twisted and Neel-type for strained systems. Here we utilise angle-resolved, high-resolution vector piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to spatially resolve polarization components and topological polar nanostructures in marginally twisted bilayer WSe2, and provide experimental proof for the existence of topologically non-trivial meron/antimeron structures. We observe both Bloch-type and Neel-type merons, allowing us to differentiate between moire superlattices formed due to twist or heterogeneous strain. This first demonstration of non-trivial real-space topology in a twisted van der Waals heterostructure opens pathways for exploring the connection between twist and topology in engineered nano-devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-accuracy microwave sensing is widely demanded in various fields, ranging from cosmology to microwave quantum technology. Quantum receivers based on inorganic solid-state spin systems are promising candidates for such purpose because of the stability and compatibility, but their best sensitivity is currently limited to a few pT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$. Here, by utilising an enhanced readout scheme with the state-of-the-art solid-state maser technology, we develop a robust microwave quantum receiver functioned by organic molecular spins at ambient conditions. Owing to the maser amplification, the sensitivity of the receiver achieves 6.14 $\pm$ 0.17 fT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ which exceeds three orders of magnitude than that of the inorganic solid-state quantum receivers. The heterodyne detection without additional local oscillators improves bandwidth of the receiver and allows frequency detection. The scheme can be extended to other solid-state spin systems without complicated control pulses and thus enables practical applications such as electron spin resonance spectroscopy, dark matter searches, and astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>i-PI 3.0: a flexible, efficient framework for advanced atomistic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale simulations have progressed tremendously over the past decade, largely due to the availability of interatomic potentials based on machine-learning algorithms. These potentials enable the combination of the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with extensive length and time scales. In this paper, we present a new release of the i-PI code that allows the community to fully benefit from the rapid developments in the field. i-PI is a Python software that facilitates the integration of different methods and different software tools by using a socket interface for inter-process communication. The current framework is flexible enough to support rapid prototyping and the combination of various simulation techniques, while maintaining a speed that prevents it from becoming the bottleneck in most workflows. We discuss the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities. For this release, we also improved some computational bottlenecks of the implementation, reducing the overhead associated with using i-PI over a native implementation of molecular dynamics techniques. We show numerical benchmarks using widely adopted machine learning potentials, such as Behler-Parinello, DeepMD and MACE neural networks, and demonstrate that such overhead is negligible for systems containing between 100 and 12000 atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring new Hall effect is always a fascinating research topic. The ordinary Hall effect and the quantum Hall effect, initially discovered in two-dimensional (2D) non-magnetic systems, are the phenomena that a transverse current is generated when a system carrying an electron current is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the currents. In this work, we propose the electric counterparts of these two Hall effects, termed as electric Hall effect (EHE) and quantum electric Hall effect (QEHE). The EHE and QEHE emerge in 2D magnetic systems, where the transverse current is generated by applying an electric gate-field instead of a magnetic field. We present a symmetry requirement for intrinsic EHE and QEHE. With a weak gate-field, we establish an analytical expression of the intrinsic EHE coefficient. We show that it is determined by intrinsic band geometric quantities: Berry curvature and its polarizability which consists of both intraband and interband layer polarization. Via first-principles calculations, we investigate the EHE in the monolayer Ca(FeN)$_2$, where significant EHE coefficient is observed around band crossings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QEHE can appear in the semiconductor monolayer $\rm BaMn_2S_3$, of which the Hall conductivity exhibits steps that take on the quantized values $0$ and $\pm1$ in the unit of $e^2/h$ by varying the gate-field within the experimentally achievable range. Due to the great tunability of the electric gate-field, the EHE and QEHE proposed here can be easily controlled and should have more potential applications.</description>

      <title>Extended Kohler's scaling, a low temperature anomaly and Isosbestic point in the charge density wave state of 1T-VSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1T-VSe$_2$ is a narrow band transition metal chalcogenide that shows charge density wave (CDW) state below $T_{CDW}$ = 110 K. Here, we have explored the relevance of Kohler's rule and the thermal transport properties of VSe$_2$ across the CDW state. The magnetoresistance (MR) follows Kohler's rule above $T_{CDW}$, while an extended Kohler's rule is employed below $T_{CDW}$. Interestingly, we observed an anomaly in MR at T = 20 K, below which MR value decreases on lowering temperature. This anomaly is also reflected in the slope ($\kappa$) of Kohler's plots and the relative change in the thermal excitation induced carrier density ($n_T$) also. The $T_{CDW}$ remains largely unaffected in both electrical resistivity ($\rho(T)$) and longitudinal Seebeck coefficient ($\it{S_{xx}}$) even under a strong magnetic field of 14 Tesla. However, the application of magnetic field enhances the peak intensity of $\it{S_{xx}}$ at T $\sim$ 60 K. Additionally, $\it{S_{xx}(T)}$ curves measured at different fields exhibit a crossover at T = 20 K, which suggest the existence of unique feature in the CDW state of VSe$_2$ \textit{i.e.} a locally exact isosbestic point.</description>

Abstract: Lablets are autonomous microscopic particles with programmable CMOS electronics that can control electrokinetic phenomena and electrochemical reactions in solution via actuator and sensor microelectrodes. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of optimized singulated lablets (CMOS3) with dimensions 140x140x50 um carrying an integrated coplanar encapsulated supercapacitor as a rechargeable power supply. The lablets are designed to allow docking to one another or to a smart surface for interchange of energy, electronic information, and chemicals. The paper focusses on the digital and analog design of the lablets to allow significant programmable functionality in a microscopic footprint, including the control of autonomous actuation and sensing up to the level of being able to support a complete lablet self-reproduction life cycle, although experimentally this remains to be proven. The potential of lablets in autonomous sensing and control and for evolutionary experimentation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tuning structural modulation and magnetic properties in metal-organic coordination polymers [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three solid solutions of [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$, with $x$ = 0.25 (1), 0.50 (2) and 0.75 (3), were synthesized and their nuclear structures and magnetic properties were characterized using single crystal neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements. At room temperature, all three compounds crystallize in the Pnma orthorhombic space group, akin to the cobalt and nickel end series members. Upon cooling, each compound undergoes distinct series of structural transitions to modulated structures. Compound 1 exhibits a phase transition to a modulated structure analogous to the pure nickel compound, while compound 3 maintains the behaviour observed in the pure cobalt compound, although in both cases the temperatures at which the phase transitions occur differ slightly from the pure phases. Monochromatic neutron diffraction measurements showed that the structural evolution of 2 diverges from that of either parent compound, with the competing hydrogen bond interactions which drive the modulation throughout the series producing a unique sequence of phases. It involves two modulated phases below 96(3) K and 59(3) K, with different q vectors, similar to the pure cobalt compound (with modulated phases below 128 K and 96 K), however it maintains the modulated phase below magnetic order (at 22.5(7) K), resembling the pure nickel compound (which present magnetic order below 34 K), resulting in an improper modulated magnetic structure. Despite these large scale structural changes, magnetometry data reveal that the bulk magnetic properties of these solid solutions form a linear continuum between the end members. Notably, doping of the metal site in these solid solutions allows for tuning of bulk magnetic properties, including magnetic ordering temperature, transition temperatures, and the nature of nuclear phase transitions, through adjustment of metal ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing topological superconductivity by integrating high-transition-temperature ($T_C$) superconductors with topological insulators can open new paths for quantum computing applications. Here, we report a new approach for increasing the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{C}^{onset}$) by interfacing the unconventional superconductor Fe(Te,Se) with the topological insulator Bi-Te system in the low-Se doping regime, near where superconductivity vanishes in the bulk. The critical finding is that the $T_{C}^{onset}$ of Fe(Te,Se) increases from nominally non-superconducting to as high as 12.5 K when $Bi_2Te_3$ is replaced with the topological phase $Bi_4Te_3$. Interfacing Fe(Te,Se) with $Bi_4Te_3$ is also found to be critical for stabilizing superconductivity in monolayer films where $T_{C}^{onset}$ can be as high as 6 K. Measurements of the electronic and crystalline structure of the $Bi_4Te_3$ layer reveal that a large electron transfer, epitaxial strain, and novel chemical reduction processes are critical factors for the enhancement of superconductivity. This novel route for enhancing $T_C$ in an important epitaxial system provides new insight on the nature of interfacial superconductivity and a platform to identify and utilize new electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Probing Berry curvature in magnetic topological insulators through resonant infrared magnetic circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing the quantum geometry and topology in condensed matter systems has relied heavily on static electronic transport experiments in magnetic fields. Yet, contact-free optical measurements have rarely been explored. Magnetic dichroism (MCD), the nonreciprocal absorption of circular polarized light, was theoretically linked to the quantized anomalous Hall effect in magnetic insulators and can identify the bands and momenta responsible for the underlying Berry Curvature (BC). Detecting BC through MCD faces two challenges: First, the relevant inter-band transitions usually generate MCD in the infrared (IR) range, requiring large samples with high quality. Second, while most magnetic materials are metallic, the relation between MCD and BC in metals remains unclear. Here, we report the observation of MCD in the IR range along with the anomalous Hall effect in thin film MnBi2Te4. Both phenomena emerge with a field-driven phase transition from an antiferromagnet to a canted ferromagnet. By theoretically relating the MCD to the anomalous Hall effect via BC in a metal, we show that this transition accompanies an abrupt onset of BC, signaling a topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a doped Chern insulator. Our density functional theory calculation suggests the MCD signal mainly originates from an optical transition at the Brillouin zone edge, hinting at a potential new source of BC away from the commonly considered {\Gamma} point. Our findings demonstrate a novel experimental approach for detecting BC and identifying the responsible bands and momenta, generally applicable to magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Utilizing frustration for milli-Kelvin adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manifold of energetically degenerate configurations arising from competing interactions in frustrated magnets gives rise to an enhanced entropy at lowest temperatures, which can be utilized for adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR). We review structural and magnetic properties of various Yb- and Gd-based oxides featuring frustration related to different triangular moment configurations and (in some cases) structural randomness. In comparison to paramagnetic hydrated salts, which have traditionally been employed for mK-ADR, these novel ADR materials enable cooling to temperatures several times lower than the magnetic interaction strength, significantly enhancing the entropy density and cooling power at a given target temperature. A further advantage is their chemical stability, allowing for a much simpler ADR pill design and ultra-high vacuum applications. For the temperature range between 0.02 and 2 K, a systematic comparison of the field-induced entropy density change is provided, that illustrates the advantages of frustrated magnets for low-temperature ADR.</description>

      <title>Topological interfacial states in ferroelectric domain walls of two-dimensional bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using machine learning methods, we explore different types of domain walls in the recently unveiled single-element ferroelectric, the bismuth monolayer [Nature 617, 67 (2023)]. Remarkably, our investigation reveals that the charged domain wall configuration exhibits lower energy compared to the uncharged domain wall structure. We also demonstrate that the experimentally discovered tail-to-tail domain wall maintains topological interfacial states caused by the change in the Z_2 number between ferroelectric and paraelectric states. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic built-in electric fields in asymmetry DW configurations, we find that the energy of topological interfacial states splits, resulting in an accidental band crossing at the Fermi level. Our study suggests that domain walls in two-dimensional bismuth hold potential as a promising platform for the development of ferroelectric domain wall devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport of Li$_3$PS$_4$ solid electrolytes with ab initio accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast amount of computational studies on electrical conduction in solid state electrolytes is not mirrored by comparable efforts addressing thermal conduction, which has been scarcely investigated despite its relevance to thermal management and (over)heating of batteries. The reason for this lies in the complexity of the calculations: on one hand, the diffusion of ionic charge carriers makes lattice methods formally unsuitable, due to the lack of equilibrium atomic positions needed for normal-mode expansion. On the other hand, the prohibitive cost of large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of heat transport in large systems at ab initio levels has hindered the use of MD-based methods. In this work, we leverage recently developed machine-learning potentials targeting different ab initio functionals (PBEsol, r$^2$SCAN, PBE0) and a state-of-the-art formulation of the Green-Kubo theory of heat transport in multicomponent systems to compute the thermal conductivity of a promising solid-state-electrolyte, Li$_3$PS$_4$, in all its polymorphs ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$). By comparing MD estimates with lattice methods on the low-temperature, non-diffusive $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$, we highlight strong anharmonicities and negligible nuclear quantum effects, hence further justifying MD-based methods even for non diffusive phases. Finally, for the ion-conducting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, where the multicomponent Green-Kubo MD approach is mandatory, our simulations indicate a weak temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, a glass-like behavior due to the effective local disorder characterizing these Li-diffusing phases.</description>

      <title>Water-enhancing gels exhibiting heat-activated formation of silica aerogels for protection of critical infrastructure during catastrophic wildfire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising strategy to address the pressing challenges with wildfire, particularly in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), involves developing new approaches for preventing and controlling wildfire within wildlands. Among sprayable fire-retardant materials, water-enhancing gels have emerged as exceptionally effective for protecting civil infrastructure. They possess favorable wetting and viscoelastic properties that reduce the likelihood of ignition, maintaining strong adherence to a wide array of surfaces after application. Although current water-enhancing hydrogels effectively maintain surface wetness by creating a barricade, they rapidly desiccate and lose efficacy under high heat and wind typical of wildfire conditions. To address this limitation, we developed unique biomimetic hydrogel materials from sustainable cellulosic polymers crosslinked by colloidal silica particles that exhibit ideal viscoelastic properties and facile manufacturing. Under heat activation, the hydrogel transitions into a highly porous and thermally insulative silica aerogel coating in situ, providing a robust protective layer against ignition of substrates, even when the hydrogel fire suppressant becomes completely desiccated. By confirming the mechanical properties, substrate adherence, and enhanced substrate protection against fire, these heat-activatable biomimetic hydrogels emerge as promising candidates for next-generation water-enhancing fire suppressants. These advancements have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to protect homes and critical infrastructure during wildfire.</description>

      <title>Atomistic-informed phase field modeling of magnesium twin growth by disconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nucleation and propagation of disconnections play an essential role during twin growth. Atomistic methods can reveal such small structural features on twin facets and model their motion, yet are limited by the simulation length and time scales. Alternatively, mesoscale modeling approaches (such as the phase field method) address these constraints of atomistic simulations and can maintain atomic-level accuracy when integrated with atomic-level information. In this work, a phase field model is used to simulate the disconnection-mediated twinning, informed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This work considers the specific case of the growth of $\{10\bar{1}2\}$ twin in magnesium. MD simulations are first conducted to obtain the orientation-dependent interface mobility and motion threshold, and to simulate twin embryo growth and collect facet velocities, which can be used for calibrating the continuum model. The phase field disconnections model, based on the principle of minimum dissipation potential, provides the theoretical framework. This model incorporates a nonconvex grain boundary energy, elasticity and shear coupling, and simulates disconnections as a natural emergence under the elastic driving force. The phase field model is further optimized by including the anisotropic interface mobility and motion threshold suggested by MD simulations. Results agree with MD simulations of twin embryo growth in the aspects of final twin thickness, twin shape, and twin size, as well as the kinetic behavior of twin boundaries and twin tips. The simulated twin microstructure is also consistent with experimental observations, demonstrating the fidelity of the model.</description>

      <title>Cluster-based multidimensional scaling embedding tool for data visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new technique for visualizing high-dimensional data called cluster MDS (cl-MDS), which addresses a common difficulty of dimensionality reduction methods: preserving both local and global structures of the original sample in a single 2-dimensional visualization. Its algorithm combines the well-known multidimensional scaling (MDS) tool with the $k$-medoids data clustering technique, and enables hierarchical embedding, sparsification and estimation of 2-dimensional coordinates for additional points. While cl-MDS is a generally applicable tool, we also include specific recipes for atomic structure applications. We apply this method to non-linear data of increasing complexity where different layers of locality are relevant, showing a clear improvement in their retrieval and visualization quality.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Tunable moir\'e bandgap in hBN-aligned bilayer graphene device with in-situ electrostatic gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the years, great efforts have been devoted in introducing a sizable and tunable band gap in graphene for its potential application in next-generation electronic devices. The primary challenge in modulating this gap has been the absence of a direct method for observing changes of the band gap in momentum space. In this study, we employ advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moir\'e potentials. The application of displacement field via in-situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moir\'e potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ~ 20 meV. Theoretical calculations, effectively capture the experimental observations. Our investigation provides a quantitative understanding of how these two mechanisms collaboratively modulate the band gap in bilayer graphene, offering valuable guidance for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Vibrational modes as the origin of dielectric loss at 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz in a-SiC:H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-loss deposited dielectrics are beneficial for the advancement of superconducting integrated circuits for astronomy. In the microwave band ($\mathrm{\sim}$1$\unicode{x2013}$10 GHz) the cryogenic and low-power dielectric loss is dominated by two-level systems. However, the origin of the loss in the millimeter-submillimeter band ($\mathrm{\sim}$0.1$\unicode{x2013}$1 THz) is not understood. We measured the loss of hydrogenated amorphous SiC (a-SiC:H) films in the 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz range using superconducting microstrip resonators and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The agreement between the loss data and a Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion model suggests that vibrational modes above 10 THz dominate the loss in the a-SiC:H above 200 GHz.</description>
