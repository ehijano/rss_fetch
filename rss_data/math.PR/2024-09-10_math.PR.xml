      <title>On the iterations of some random functions with Lipschitz number one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the iterations of $x\mapsto |x-\theta|$ random functions with Lipschitz number one, we represent the dynamics as a Markov chain and prove its convergence under mild conditions. We also demonstrate that the Wasserstein metric of any two measures will not increase after the corresponding induced iterations for measures and identify conditions under which a polynomial convergence rate can be achieved in this metric. We also consider an associated nonlinear operator on the space of probability measures and identify its fixed points through an detailed analysis of their characteristic functions.</description>

      <title>A note on the fluctuations of the resolvent traces of a tensor model of sample covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider a sample covariance matrix of the form $$M_{n}=\sum_{\alpha=1}^m \tau_\alpha {\mathbf{y}}_{\alpha}^{(1)} \otimes {\mathbf{y}}_{\alpha}^{(2)}({\mathbf{y}}_{\alpha}^{(1)} \otimes {\mathbf{y}}_{\alpha}^{(2)})^T,$$ where $(\mathbf{y}_{\alpha}^{(1)},\, {\mathbf{y}}_{\alpha}^{(2)})_{\alpha}$ are independent vectors uniformly distributed on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$ and $\tau_\alpha \in \mathbb{R}_+ $. We show that as $m, n \to \infty$, $m/n^2\to c&gt;0$, the centralized traces of the resolvents, $\mathrm{Tr}(M_n-zI_n)^{-1}-\mathbf{E}\mathrm{Tr}(M_n-zI_n)^{-1}$, $\Im z\ge \eta_0&gt;0$, converge in distribution to a two-dimensional Gaussian random variable with zero mean and a certain covariance matrix. This work is a continuation of Dembczak-Ko{\l}odziejczyk and Lytova (2023), and Lytova (2018).</description>

      <title>Network evolution with Macroscopic Delays: asymptotics and condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the explosion of data and the impact of real-world networks, a wide array of mathematical models have been proposed to understand the structure and evolution of such systems, especially in the temporal context. Recent advances in areas such as distributed cyber-security and social networks have motivated the development of probabilistic models of evolution where individuals have only partial information on the state of the network when deciding on their actions. This paper aims to understand models incorporating \emph{network delay}, where new individuals have information on a time-delayed snapshot of the system. We consider the setting where one has macroscopic delays, that is, the ``information'' available to new individuals is the structure of the network at a past time, which scales proportionally with the current time and vertices connect using standard preferential attachment type dynamics. We obtain the local weak limit for the network as its size grows and connect it to a novel continuous-time branching process where the associated point process of reproductions \emph{has memory} of the entire past. A more tractable `dual description' of this branching process using an `edge copying mechanism' is used to obtain degree distribution asymptotics as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for condensation, where the mass of the degree distribution ``escapes to infinity''. We conclude by studying the impact of the delay distribution on macroscopic functionals such as the root degree.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic delocalization of low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interfaces above a hard floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entropic repulsion of the low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interface in an $n\times n \times n$ box with blue boundary conditions on its bottom face (the hard floor), and red boundary conditions on its other five faces. For Ising, Frohlich and Pfister proved in 1987 that the typical interface height above the origin diverges (non-quantitatively), via correlation inequalities special to the Ising model; no such result was known for Potts. We show for both the Ising and Potts models that the entropic repulsion fully overcomes the potentially attractive interaction with the floor, and obtain a logarithmically diverging lower bound on the typical interface height. This is complemented by a conjecturally sharp upper bound of $\lfloor \xi^{-1}\log n\rfloor$ where $\xi$ is the rate function for a point-to-plane non-red connection under the infinite volume red measure. The proof goes through a coupled random-cluster interface to overcome the potential attractive interaction with the boundary, and a coupled fuzzy Potts model to reduce the upper bound to a simpler setting where the repulsion is attained by conditioning a no-floor interface to lie in the upper half-space.</description>

      <title>Functional approximation of the marked Hawkes risk process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The marked Hawkes risk process is a compound point process for which the occurrence and amplitude of past events impact the future. Thanks to its autoregressive properties, it found applications in various fields such as neuosciences, social networks and insurance.Since data in real life is acquired over a discrete time grid, we propose a strong discrete-time approximation of the continuous-time Hawkes risk process obtained be embedding from the same Poisson measure. We then prove trajectorial convergence results both in some fractional Sobolev spaces and in the Skorokhod space, hence extending the theorems proven in the literature. We also provide upper bounds on the convergence speed with explicit dependence on the size of the discretisation step, the time horizon and the regularity of the kernel.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator for Hidden Markov Models indexed by binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hidden Markov models indexed by a binary tree where the hidden state space is a general metric space. We study the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the model parameters based only on the observed variables. In both stationary and non-stationary regimes, we prove strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLE under standard assumptions. Those standard assumptions imply uniform exponential memorylessness properties of the initial distribution conditional on the observations. The proofs rely on ergodic theorems for Markov chain indexed by trees with neighborhood-dependent functions.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of exchangeable or spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit $N\to\infty$, when synaptic weights scale as $O(1/N)$. This asymptotic behavior has been proven in several works but a general question has remained unanswered: does the $O(1/N)$ scaling of synaptic weights, by itself, suffice to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be exchangeable or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying only a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits (graphons), we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to re-interpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation and Moderate Deviations of Poisson Shot Noises with Application to Compound Generalized Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give explicit bounds on the Wasserstein and the Kolmogorov distances between random variables lying in the first chaos of the Poisson space and the standard Normal distribution, using the results proved by Last, Peccati and Schulte. Relying on the theory developed in the work of Saulis and Statulevicius and on a fine control of the cumulants of the first chaoses, we also derive moderate deviation principles, Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Normal approximation bounds with Cram\'er correction terms for the same variables. The aforementioned results are then applied to Poisson shot-noise processes and, in particular, to the generalized compound Hawkes point processes (a class of stochastic models, introduced in this paper, which generalizes classical Hawkes processes). This extends the recent results availale in the literature regarding the Normal approximation and moderate deviations.</description>

      <title>Enzyme kinetic reactions as interacting particle systems: Stochastic averaging and parameter inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of multistage Michaelis--Menten (MM) type enzyme kinetic reactions describing the conversion of substrate molecules to a product through several intermediate species. The high-dimensional, multiscale nature of these reaction networks presents significant computational challenges, especially in statistical estimation of reaction rates. This difficulty is amplified when direct data on system states are unavailable, and one only has access to a random sample of product formation times. To address this, we proceed in two stages. First, under certain technical assumptions akin to those made in the Quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) literature, we prove two asymptotic results: a stochastic averaging principle that yields a lower-dimensional model, and a functional central limit theorem that quantifies the associated fluctuations. Next, for statistical inference of the parameters of the original MM reaction network, we develop a mathematical framework involving an interacting particle system (IPS) and prove a propagation of chaos result that allows us to write a product-form likelihood function. The novelty of the IPS-based inference method is that it does not require information about the state of the system and works with only a random sample of product formation times. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the efficacy of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of quenched and annealed random walk in mixing random environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of large deviation principles of random walk in strongly mixing environments. The quenched and annealed rate functions have the same zero set whose shape is either a singleton point or a line segment, with an illustrative example communicated and given by F. Rassoul-Agha. Whenever the level of disorder is controlled, the two rate functions agree on compact set at the boundary under mixing conditions and in the interior under finite-dependence condition. Along the line we also indicate that under slightly more refined conditions, there is a phase transition of the difference of two rate functions.</description>

      <title>Random Chowla's Conjecture for Rademacher Multiplicative Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of partial sums of Rademacher random multiplicative functions $(f(n))_n$ evaluated at polynomial arguments. We show that for a polynomial $P\in \mathbb Z[x]$ that is a product of distinct linear factors or an irreducible quadratic satisfying a natural condition, there exists a constant $\kappa_P&gt;0$ such that
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa_P N}}\sum_{n\leq N}f(P(n))\xrightarrow{d}\mathcal{N}(0,1),
  \]
  as $N\rightarrow\infty$, where convergence is in distribution to a standard (real) Gaussian. This confirms a conjecture of Najnudel and addresses a question of Klurman-Shkredov-Xu.
  We also study large fluctuations of $\sum_{n\leq N}f(n^2+1)$ and show that there almost surely exist arbitrarily large values of $N$ such that \[ \Big|\sum_{n\leq N}f(n^2+1)\Big|\gg \sqrt{N \log\log N}. \] This matches the bound one expects from the law of iterated logarithm.</description>

      <title>Finite-time horizon, stopper vs. singular-controller games on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. Compared to the existing literature on this topic, we introduce new probabilistic methods to obtain gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations (PDE) that approximate the variational inequality.</description>

      <title>Valuation Model of Chinese Convertible Bonds Based on Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of pricing Chinese convertible bonds(CCB) by Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming. At each exercising time, we use the state variables of the underlying stock to regress the continuation value, and then we apply standard backward induction to get the coefficients until the moment of time zero, thus the price of the CCB is obtained. We apply the pricing of CCBs by simulation and test the performance of an under-priced strategy: long the 10 most underpriced CCBs and rebalance daily. The result show this strategy significantly outperforms the double-low strategy which is used as a benchmark. In practice, CCB issuers usually use the downward adjustment clause to to avoid financial distress upon put provision. Therefore, we treat the downward adjustment clause as a probabilistic event triggering the put provision. In this way, we combine the downward adjustment clause with put provision in a simple manner.</description>

Abstract: We study the interface of the Ising model in a box of side-length $n$ in $\mathbb Z^3$ at low temperature $1/\beta$ under Dobrushin's boundary conditions, conditioned to stay in a half-space above height $h$ (a hard floor). Without this conditioning, Dobrushin showed in 1972 that typically most of the interface is flat at height $0$. With the floor, for small $h$, the model is expected to exhibit {\it entropic repulsion}, where the typical height of the interface lifts off of $0$. Detailed understanding of the SOS model -- a more tractable height function approximation of 3D Ising -- due to Caputo et al., suggests that there is a single integer value $-h_n^* \sim -c\log n$ of the floor height, delineating the transition between rigidity at height $0$ and entropic repulsion.
  We identify an explicit $h_n^*=( c_\star+o(1))\log n$ such that, for the typical Ising interface above a hard floor at $h$, all but an $\epsilon(\beta)$-fraction of the sites are propelled to be above height $0$ if $h &lt; h_n^*-1$, whereas all but an $\epsilon(\beta)$-fraction of the sites remain at height $0$ if $h\geq h_n^*$. Further, $c_\star$ is such that the typical height of the unconditional maximum is $(2c_\star + o(1))\log n$; this confirms scaling predictions from the SOS approximation.</description>

      <title>Extrema of 3D Potts interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interface between the plus and minus phases in the low temperature 3D Ising model has been intensely studied since Dobrushin's pioneering works in the early 1970's established its rigidity. Advances in the last decade yielded the tightness of the maximum of the interface of this Ising model on the cylinder of side length $n$, around a mean that is asymptotically $c\log n$ for an explicit $c$ (temperature dependent). In this work, we establish analogous results for the 3D Potts and random cluster (FK) models. Compared to 3D Ising, the Potts model and its lack of monotonicity form obstacles for existing methods, calling for new proof ideas, while its interfaces (and associated extrema) exhibit richer behavior. We show that the maxima and minima of the interface bounding the blue component in the 3D Potts interface, and those of the interface bounding the bottom component in the 3D FK model, are governed by 4 different large deviation rates, whence the corresponding global extrema feature 4 distinct constants $c$ as above. Due to the above obstacles, our methods are initially only applicable to 1 of these 4 interface extrema, and additional ideas are needed to recover the other 3 rates given the behavior of the first one.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of Leray-Hopf solutions for stochastic forced Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic forced Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ starting from zero initial condition. The noise is linear multiplicative and the equations are perturbed by an additional body force. Based on the ideas of Albritton, Bru\'e and Colombo \cite{ABC22}, we prove non-uniqueness of local-in-time Leray--Hopf solutions as well as joint non-uniqueness in law for solutions on $\mathbb{R}^{+}$. In the deterministic setting, we show that the set of forces, for which Leray--Hopf solutions are non-unique, is dense in $L^{1}_{t}L^{2}_{x}$. In addition, by a simple controllability argument we show that for every divergence-free initial condition in $L^{2}_{x}$ there is a force so that non-uniqueness of Leray--Hopf solutions holds.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Space-time White Noise and Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book is an introduction to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), using the random field approach pioneered by J.B. Walsh (1986). The volume consists of two blocks: the core matter (Chapters 1 to 5) and the appendices (A, B and C). Chapter 1 introduces the subject, with a discussion of isonormal Gaussian processes, space-time white noise, and motivating examples of SPDEs. Chapter 2 presents a theory of stochastic integration with respect to space-time white noise. Chapter 3 deals with SPDEs with additive noise. In Chapter 4, we study a general class of SPDEs, in which additive and multiplicative nonlinearities appear. In Chapter 5, we present a selection of important topics in the theory of SPDEs, that have been the subject of much research over the last twenty years. Appendix A summarises the main results from the theory of stochastic processes and stochastic analysis that are used throughout the book. Appendix B is devoted to a systematic presentation of properties of fundamental solutions and Green's functions associated to the classical linear differential operators (heat, fractional heat and wave operators). Appendix C is a toolbox section. Each chapter is followed by a "Notes" section, which gives historically important references, original sources and points towards other related important contributions.</description>

      <title>A Stein characterisation of the distribution of the product of correlated normal random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a Stein characterisation of the distribution of the product of two correlated normal random variables with non-zero means, and more generally the distribution of the sum of independent copies of such random variables. Our Stein characterisation is shown to naturally generalise a number of other Stein characterisations in the literature. From our Stein characterisation we derive recursive formulas for the moments of the product of two correlated normal random variables, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables, which allows for efficient computation of higher order moments.</description>

      <title>Hairer-Quastel universality for KPZ -- polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of weakly asymmetric continuous microscopic growth models with polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and a Poisson type noise. We show that they converge to the KPZ equation after proper rescaling and re-centering, where the coupling constant depends nontrivially on all details of the smoothing and growth mechanisms in the microscopic model. This confirms some of the predictions in [HQ18], and provides a first example of Hairer-Quastel type with both a generic nonlinearity (non-polynomial) and a non-Gaussian noise.
  The proof builds on the general discretisation framework of regularity structures ([EH19]), and employs the idea of using the spectral gap inequality to control stochastic objects as developed and systematised in [LOTT21,HS24], together with a new observation on the specific structure of the (discrete) Malliavin derivatives in our situation. This structure enables us to reduce the control of mixed $L^p$ spacetime norms (of arbitrarily large $p$) by certain $L^2$-norms in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Sharp Propagation of Chaos for the Ensemble Langevin Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to revisit propagation of chaos for a Langevin-type interacting particle system used for sampling probability measures. The interacting particle system we consider coincides, in the setting of a log-quadratic target distribution, with the ensemble Kalman sampler, for which propagation of chaos was first proved by Ding and Li. Like these authors, we prove propagation of chaos using a synchronous coupling as a starting point, as in Sznitman's classical argument. Instead of relying on a boostrapping argument, however, we use a technique based on stopping times in order to handle the presence of the empirical covariance in the coefficients of the dynamics. This approach originates from numerical analysis and was recently employed to prove mean field limits for consensus-based optimization and related interacting particle systems. In the context of ensemble Langevin sampling, it enables proving pathwise propagation of chaos with optimal rate, whereas previous results were optimal only up to a positive epsilon.</description>

      <title>On the Gardner Transition in the Ising Pure $p$-Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) for the mean field Ising spin glasses at finite temperature and identify the first critical temperature in Gardner transition. Specifically, Gardner conjectured that for Ising pure $p$-spin glasses with $p\geq 3,$ there are two phase transitions: the Parisi measure is Replica Symmetric (RS) at high temperatures, then transitions to One-Step Replica Symmetry Breaking (1RSB) at a lower temperature, and finally reaches Full Replica Symmetry Breaking (FRSB) at very low temperatures. Our main results verify the first part of the Gardner transition: for any $p \geq 3,$ there exists a unique $\beta^p_1&gt;0$ such that the Parisi measure is RS for $0 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_{1}$ and then 1RSB for $\beta^p_1 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_1+\epsilon_p$ with some $\epsilon_p&gt;0.$ We also provide a computational method to locate $\beta^p_1$ for any $p \geq 3.$</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to the analysis of the global well-posedness and the interior regularity of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with inhomogeneous stochastic boundary conditions. The noise, white in time and coloured in space, can be interpreted as the physical law describing the driving mechanism on the atmosphere-ocean interface, i.e. as a balance of the shear stress of the ocean and the horizontal wind force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the numerical approximation of a class of ergodic Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. These equations are formulated in an infinite horizon framework and provide a probabilistic representation for elliptic Partial Differential Equations of ergodic type. In order to build our numerical scheme, we put forward a new representation of the PDE solution by using a classical probabilistic representation of the gradient. Then, based on this representation, we propose a fully implementable numerical scheme using a Picard iteration procedure, a grid space discretization and a Monte-Carlo approximation. Up to a limiting technical condition that guarantees the contraction of the Picard procedure, we obtain an upper bound for the numerical error. We also provide some numerical experiments that show the efficiency of this approach for small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Graphon branching processes and fractional isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs, Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan introduced a class of branching processes parametrized by a possibly unbounded graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic, a notion introduced by Greb\'ik and Rocha.
  A different class of branching processes was introduced by Hladk\'y, Nachmias, and Tran in relation to uniform spanning trees in finite graphs approximating a given connected graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic up to scalar multiple. Combined with a recent result of Archer and Shalev, this implies that if uniform spanning trees of two dense graphs have a similar local structure, they have a similar scaling limit.
  As a side result we give a characterization of fractional isomorphism for graphs as well as graphons in terms of their connected components.</description>
