      <title>Optimized Signal Estimation in Nanomechanical Photothermal Sensing via Thermal Response Modelling and Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an advanced thermal response model for micro- and nanomechanical systems in photothermal sensing, designed to balance speed and precision. Our model considers the two time constants of the nanomechanical element and the supporting chip, triggered by photothermal heating, enabling precise photothermal input signal estimation through Kalman filtering. By integrating heat transfer and noise models, we apply an adaptive Kalman filter optimized for FPGA systems in real-time or offline. This method, used for photothermal infrared (IR) spectroscopy with nanomechanical resonators and a quantum cascade laser (QCL) in step-scan mode, enhances response speed beyond standard low-pass filters, reducing the effects of drift and random walk. Analytical calculations show the significant impact of the thermal expansion coefficients' ratio on the frequency response. The adaptive Kalman filter, informed by the QCL's input characteristics, accelerates the system's response, allowing rapid and precise IR spectrum generation. The use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and PSD analysis for system identification further refines our approach, promising fast and accurate nanomechanical photothermal sensing.</description>

      <title>Double-layer Thin-film LiNbO3 Longitudinally Excited Shear Wave Resonators with Ultra-large Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient and Spurious-Free Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a double-layer thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3) longitudinally excited shear wave resonator with a theoretical electromechanical coupling coefficient exceeding 60%, RaR close to 28%, and no spurious modes. This ultra-large electromechanical coupling coefficient, which is close to the upper limit of LiNbO3, is much larger than all microwave acoustic resonators reported so far. Based on X-cut thin-film LiNbO3, when the film thickness is in the order of hundreds of nanometers, the frequency of the fundamental mode of the resonator can cover 1GHz to10GHz. The resonator design is convenient and flexible. The resonant frequency can be modulated monotonically by changing either the electrode or the thickness of the thin-film LiNbO3 without introducing additional spurious modes. This ideal resonator architecture is also applicable to LiTaO3. With the development of the new generation of mobile communications, this resonator is expected to become a key solution for future high-performance, ultra-wide-bandwidth acoustic filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, multi-physics topology optimization is employed to achieve the detailed design of a lightweight porous linear actuation mechanism that harnesses energy through laser activation. A multiscale topology optimization methodology is introduced for micro- and macroscale design, considering energy dissipation via heat convection and radiation. This investigation meticulously considers the impact of heat dissipation mechanisms, including thermal conduction, convection, and radiation. Through various numerical cases, we systematically explore the influence of micro-scale considerations on porous design and understand the effects on the topology optimization process by incorporating various microstructural systems. The results demonstrate that porous actuator designs exhibit superior performance compared to solid actuator designs. This study contributes to advancing the understanding of multiscale effects in topology optimization, paving the way for more efficient and lightweight designs in the field of laser-activated porous actuators.</description>

      <title>Charge pumping in hBN-encapsulated graphene driven by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on piezoelectric insulators can generate dynamic periodic potentials inside one-dimensional and two-dimensional materials. These periodic potentials have been utilized or proposed for various applications, including acoustoelectric charge pumping. In this study, we investigate acoustoelectric charge pumping in graphene with very low electrostatic disorder. By employing a graphite top gate on boron-nitride-encapsulated graphene, we adjust the graphene carrier concentration over a broad range, enabling us to examine the acoustoelectric signal in both mixed-carrier and single-carrier regimes. We discuss the benefits of hBN-encapsulated graphene for charge pumping applications and introduce a model that describes the acoustoelectric signal across all carrier concentrations, including at the charge neutrality point. This quantitative model will support future SAW-enabled explorations of phenomena in low-dimensional materials and guide the design of novel SAW sensors.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Inverse Design of Multi-bit Programmable Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging reconfigurable metasurfaces offer various possibilities in programmatically manipulating electromagnetic waves across spatial, spectral, and temporal domains, showcasing great potential for enhancing terahertz applications. However, they are hindered by limited tunability, particularly evident in relatively small phase tuning over 270o, due to the design constraints with time-intensive forward design methodologies. Here, we demonstrate a multi-bit programmable metasurface capable of terahertz beam steering, facilitated by a developed physics-informed inverse design (PIID) approach. Through integrating a modified coupled mode theory (MCMT) into residual neural networks, our PIID algorithm not only significantly increases the design accuracy compared to conventional neural networks but also elucidates the intricate physical relations between the geometry and the modes. Without decreasing the reflection intensity, our method achieves the enhanced phase tuning as large as 300o. Additionally, we experimentally validate the inverse designed programmable beam steering metasurface, which is adaptable across 1-bit, 2-bit, and tri-state coding schemes, yielding a deflection angle up to 68o and broadened steering coverage. Our demonstration provides a promising pathway for rapidly exploring advanced metasurface devices, with potentially great impact on communication and imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>Strategies to enhance THz harmonic generation combining multilayered, gated, and metamaterial-based architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene has unique properties paving the way for groundbreaking future applications. Its large optical nonlinearity and ease of integration in devices notably makes it an ideal candidate to become a key component for all-optical switching and frequency conversion applications. In the terahertz (THz) region, various approaches have been independently demonstrated to optimize the nonlinear effects in graphene, addressing a critical limitation arising from the atomically thin interaction length. Here, we demonstrate sample architectures that combine strategies to enhance THz nonlinearities in graphene-based structures. We achieve this by increasing the interaction length through a multilayered design, controlling carrier density with an electrical gate, and modulating the THz field spatial distribution with a metallic metasurface substrate. Our study specifically investigates third harmonic generation (THG) using a table-top high-field THz source. We measure THG enhancement factors exceeding thirty and propose architectures capable of achieving a two-order-of-magnitude increase. These findings highlight the potential of engineered graphene-based samples in advancing THz frequency conversion technologies for signal processing and wireless communication applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In tissue engineering, 3D scaffolds and chemical treatments are often used for providing a cell-friendly surface for improving cell adhesion and tissue growth. Indeed, the cell adhesion degree can be controlled by physical-chemical changes in the surface of substrates, such as wettability, surface charges and roughness. In this work, we describe the synthesis, characterization and cytocompatibility of photoresins useful for construction of cell scaffolds via two-photon polymerization. Additionally, we have demonstrated a simple surface treatment method that promotes cell adhesion. This method alters the surface charge of the polymer and enhances the adhesion of epithelial cells. Our results indicate an efficient approach for modifying the surface of biocompatible polymer scaffolds with the purpose of enhances the performance of cell functions suitable for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</description>

      <title>Effect of Overheat and Direct Flow Loading on the MEMS Bistable Flow Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the findings from an experimental study of a MEMS flow sensor in which an initially curved, double-clamped bistable microbeam is the primary sensing element. Our research explores how the overheat ratio, direct flow loading, and turbulence-induced vibration affect the sequential snap-through (ST) buckling and snap-back (SB) release of an electrostatically actuated beam heated by an electric current. The sensor is fabricated from highly doped single-crystal silicon using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. Positioned at the chip's edge, the microbeam is exposed to airflow, enabling concurrent dynamic response measurements with a laser Doppler vibrometer and a video camera. Our research demonstrates that the overheat ratio can be significantly lower for this sensing principle than conventional thermal sensing elements, pointing to the potential for substantial energy savings. We also emphasize the significant impact of flow angles and vibrations on the critical ST and SB voltages, which are vital for the flow sensor's output. Additionally, we introduce the first direct experimental observation of the beam profile's time history during the snap-through /snap-back transition. The potential impact of this research lies in developing more robust MEMS flow sensors with enhanced sensitivity and a better understanding of their response to environmental factors, which could have broader applications in fields such as aerospace, environmental monitoring, and industrial process control.</description>

      <title>Piezoresistive snap-through detection for bifurcation-based MEMS sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the piezoresistive method for detecting stability loss events in microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors based on bifurcation. The method involves measuring the resistivity changes of an entire beam to detect snap-through transitions in an electrostatically actuated, bistable double-clamped crystalline Silicon (Si) microbeam. The applicability of the suggested approach in two types of sensors - an ambient air temperature sensor or a mean air velocity sensor, is demonstrated. In both cases the bistable beam, serving as the sensing element, is affected by the electrothermal Joule's heating and air cooling. The measured signal is obtained by monitoring the critical voltages of the snap-through transitions. Piezoresistive sensing is especially suitable for the response monitoring of the exposed to the environment, free-standing heated microbeam sensors, where optical, piezoelectric, or electrostatic interrogation methods are not applicable. The approach can be implemented in various bifurcation microsensors and for response monitoring of bistable actuators.</description>

      <title>Dark excitons and hot electrons modulate exciton-photon strong coupling in metal-organic optical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polaritons, formed as a result of strong hybridization of matter with light, are promising for important applications including organic solar cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. Owing to large binding energies of Frenkel excitons (matter), strong matter-light coupling phenomena are possible at room temperature, high exciton densities, and even with low-quality-factor microcavities. In such cases, due to polaritons' high degree of delocalization, simultaneous effects from dark excitons and hot electrons may affect performance of potential devices. Their understanding, therefore, is of paramount importance, but their disentanglement in optical spectroscopy, however, thus far remained unattainable. Here, we overcome this challenge by careful and systematic analysis of transient polaritonic spectra, supported by analytical models. In doing so, we conclude that dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling and manifest themselves as Fano-like polaritonic gain-loss spectra. Free electrons add additional loss component to and imprint a two-temperature dynamics on the polaritonic response. The developed general methodology can be applied to a variety of other microcavity structures. Our findings are significant for distinguishing polaritons and other excitations in studies of polariton-electron and plasmon-electron coupling phenomena as well as photonic control over photophysical and photochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Thermoelectric Cooling for On-Demand Multi-Hotspot Thermal Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) offer a promising solution for direct cooling of local hotspots and active thermal management in advanced electronic systems. However, TECs present significant trade-offs among spatial cooling, heating and power consumption. The optimization of TECs requires extensive simulations, which are impractical for managing actual systems with multiple hotspots under spatial and temporal variations. In this study, we present a novel machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm for thermoelectric coolers that can achieve global optimal temperature by individually controlling TEC units based on real-time multi-hotspot conditions across the entire domain. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a combination of the Inception module and multi-task learning (MTL) approach to comprehend the coupled thermal-electrical physics underlying the system and attain accurate predictions for both temperature and power consumption with and without TECs. Due to the intricate interaction among passive thermal gradient, Peltier effect and Joule effect, a local optimal TEC control experiences spatial temperature trade-off which may not lead to a global optimal solution. To address this issue, we develop a backtracking-based optimization algorithm using the machine learning model to iterate all possible TEC assignments for attaining global optimal solutions. For any m by n matrix with NHS hotspots (n, m &lt;= 10, 0&lt;= NHS &lt;= 20), our algorithm is capable of providing 52.4% peak temperature reduction and its corresponding TEC array control within an average of 1.64 seconds while iterating through tens of temperature predictions behind-the-scenes. This represents a speed increase of over three orders of magnitude compared to traditional FEM strategies which take approximately 27 minutes.</description>

Abstract: We report the scientific and technical queries regarding the article reported by Kim et al.1 on the mechanical properties of graphene-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composites. Our analysis finds that the current experimental data is insufficient to fully support the conclusions presented in the article. We suggest the enhancement in Youngs modulus and strength of the graphene-PMMA laminates (GPL) samples are mainly due to the heat treatment of the polymer rather than the incorporation of graphene. The Raman spectroscopy data (as per our analysis) for the GPL samples indicates that large cracks and defects were introduced during the hot rolling process used to fabricate the graphene-PMMA composite. We believe that the queries will aid the audience in better understanding the mechanical response of graphene-PMMA composites.</description>

      <title>Phase-stabilised self-injection-locked microcomb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microresonator frequency combs (microcombs) hold great potential for precision metrology within a compact form factor, impacting a wide range of applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, environmental monitoring, time-keeping, navigation and astronomy. Through the principle of self-injection locking, electrically-driven chip-based microcombs with minimal complexity are now feasible. However, phase-stabilisation of such self-injection-locked microcombs, a prerequisite for metrological frequency comb, has not yet been attained. Here, we address this critical need by demonstrating full phase-stabilisation of a self-injection-locked microcomb. The microresonator is implemented in a silicon nitride photonic chip, and by controlling a pump laser diode and a microheater with low voltage signals (less than 1.5 V), we achieve independent control of the comb's offset and repetition rate frequencies. Both actuators reach a bandwidth of over 100 kHz, enabling phase-locking of the microcomb to external frequency references. These results establish photonic chip-based, self-injection-locked microcombs as low-complexity yet versatile sources for coherent precision metrology in emerging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguide-based interferometric circuits are widely employed in optical communications, sensing and computing applications. In particular, glass-based devices are appealing due to the transparency and bio-compatibility of this substrate, or where low-loss interfacing with fiber networks is required. However, fast electro-optic phase modulation is hard to achieve in glass materials. Here, we demonstrate an optical phase and intensity modulator in glass, working in the megahertz range. This modulator exploits the elasto-optic effect inside a mechanical microstructure, brought to oscillation at resonance, and is entirely realized by femtosecond laser micromachining. In detail, we demonstrate 23-dB optical intensity modulation at 1.17 MHz, with an internal optical loss of the phase-modulator component as low as 0.04 dB.</description>

      <title>Octave-spanning Kerr soliton frequency combs in dispersion- and dissipation-engineered lithium niobate microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons from optical microresonators, commonly referred to as soliton microcombs, have been developed for a broad range of applications, including precision measurement, optical frequency synthesis, and ultra-stable microwave and millimeter wave generation, all on a chip. An important goal for microcombs is self referencing, which requires octave-spanning bandwidths to detect and stabilize the comb carrier envelope offset frequency. Further, detection and locking of the comb spacings are often achieved using frequency division by electro-optic modulation. The thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform, with its low loss, strong second- and third-order nonlinearity, as well as large Pockels effect, is ideally suited for these tasks. However, octave-spanning soliton microcombs are challenging to demonstrate on this platform, largely complicated by strong Raman effects hindering reliable fabrication of soliton devices. Here, we demonstrate entirely connected and octave-spanning soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate. With appropriate control over microresonator free spectral range and dissipation spectrum, we show that soliton-inhibiting Raman effects are suppressed, and soliton devices are fabricated with near-unity yield. Our work offers an unambiguous method for soliton generation on strongly Raman-active materials. Further, it anticipates monolithically integrated, self-referenced frequency standards in conjunction with established technologies, such as periodically poled waveguides and electro-optic modulators, on thin-film lithium niobate.</description>

Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>

      <title>Electrically switchable $2^N$-channel wave-front control with N cascaded polarization-dependent metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces with tunable functionalities are greatly desired for modern optical system and various applications. To increase the operating channels of polarization-multiplexed metasurfaces, we proposed a structure of N cascaded dual-channel metasurfaces to achieve 2^N electrically switchable functional channels without intrinsic noise or cross-talk. As proof of principles, we have implemented a 3-layer setup to achieve 8 channels. In success, we have demonstrated two typical functionalities of vortex beam generation with switchable topological charge of l=-3 ~ +4 or l=-1~ -8, and beam steering with the deflecting direction switchable in an 8*1 line or a 4*2 grid. We believe that our proposal would provide a practical way to significantly increase the scalability and extend the functionality of polarization-multiplexed metasurfaces, which are potential for the applications of LiDAR, glasses-free 3D display, OAM (de)multiplexing, and varifocal meta-lens.</description>
