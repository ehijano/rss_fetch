      <title>Odin: Effective End-to-End SLA Decomposition for 5G/6G Network Slicing via Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing plays a crucial role in realizing 5G/6G advances, enabling diverse Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements related to latency, throughput, and reliability. Since network slices are deployed end-to-end (E2E), across multiple domains including access, transport, and core networks, it is essential to efficiently decompose an E2E SLA into domain-level targets, so that each domain can provision adequate resources for the slice. However, decomposing SLAs is highly challenging due to the heterogeneity of domains, dynamic network conditions, and the fact that the SLA orchestrator is oblivious to the domain's resource optimization. In this work, we propose Odin, a Bayesian Optimization-based solution that leverages each domain's online feedback for provably-efficient SLA decomposition. Through theoretical analyses and rigorous evaluations, we demonstrate that Odin's E2E orchestrator can achieve up to 45% performance improvement in SLA satisfaction when compared with baseline solutions whilst reducing overall resource costs even in the presence of noisy feedback from the individual domains.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Multi-source Prefetching Through Adaptive Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The World Wide Web has come to be a great part of our daily life, yet user observed latency is still a problem that needs a proper means of handling. Even though earlier attempts focused on caching as the chief solution to tackling this issue, its success was extremely limited. Prefetching has come to be the primary technique in supplementing caching towards soothing the latency problem associated with the contemporary Internet. However, existing approaches in prefetching are extremely limited in their ability to employ application level web document relationship which is often visible only to the content developer. This is because most approaches are access history based schemes that make future users' access prediction only based on past user access. Attempts to incorporate prefetching schemes that utilize semantic information with those that use users past access history are extremely limited in their extensibility. In this work we present a novel framework that enables integration of schemes from both worlds of prefetching without the need for a major modification to the algorithms. When there is a need/possibility to capture new application level context, a new algorithm could be developed to do so and then it can be integrated into the framework. Since each participating scheme is merely viewed as an algorithm that produces a list of candidate objects that are likely to be accessed in the near future, the framework can entertain any one of the existing prefetching schemes. With its adaptive weight management technique the framework adjusts the effect of each algorithm in the overall prediction to parallel with its observed performance so far. We have found this formwork to be less aggressive than its contemporary counterparts which is extremely important for resource constrained mobile devices that have come to be the major means of access by users of the current web.</description>

      <title>LINC: An In-Network Coding Approach to Tame Packet Loss in Hybrid Wireless-Fiber Backbones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of ultra-low latency applications, such as financial transactions, has driven the development of hybrid backbone networks that rely on fiber, satellite, and microwave links. Despite providing low latencies, these hybrid networks suffer from occasional environmental packet loss caused by poor weather, construction, and line of sight blockage. Paradoxically, today's hybrid backbones rely on conventional transport protocols that take packet loss to signal network congestion, as opposed to transient environmental obstacles. A common approach to address this challenge is to use network coding (NC) between the end hosts to recover from these occasional packet loss events. However, current NC proposals assume full access to the end-hosts' stack to perform end-to-end encoding/decoding operations. In this paper, we introduce LINC, a novel system that provides in-network NC capabilities to mitigate environmental packet loss events without requiring cooperation from the end hosts. LINC uses a systematic block coding approach on a link-by-link basis, encoding and decoding packets inside the network. We model the tradeoff in goodput between end-to-end retransmissions and redundant packets introduced by LINC, and propose an optimization formulation to determine the optimal choice of coding parameters. Our simulations on real-world backbone topologies demonstrate that LINC reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 18% by eliminating unnecessary retransmissions.</description>

      <title>Conducting Mission-Critical Voice Experiments with Automated Speech Recognition and Crowdsourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mission-critical voice (MCV) communications systems have been a critical tool for the public safety community for over eight decades. Public safety users expect MCV systems to operate reliably and consistently, particularly in challenging conditions. Because of these expectations, the Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been interested in correlating impairments in MCV communication systems and public safety user quality of experience (QoE). Previous research has studied MCV voice quality and intelligibility in a controlled environment. However, such research has been limited by the challenges inherent in emulating real-world environmental conditions. Additionally, there is the question of the best metric to use to reflect QoE accurately.
  This paper describes our efforts to develop the methodology and tools for human-subject experiments with MCV. We illustrate their use in human-subject experiments in emulated real-world environments. The tools include a testbed for emulating real-world MCV systems and an automated speech recognition (ASR) robot approximating human subjects in transcription tasks. We evaluate QoE through a Levenshtein Distance-based metric, arguing it is a suitable proxy for measuring comprehension and the QoE. We conducted human-subject studies with Amazon MTurk volunteers to understand the influence of selected system parameters and impairments on human subject performance and end-user QoE. We also compare the performance of several ASR system configurations with human-subject performance. We find that humans generally perform better than ASR in accuracy-related MCV tasks and that the codec significantly influences the end-user QoE and ASR performance.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Intent-Based Networking Scenarios: A GitOps and Nephio Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GitOps has emerged as a foundational paradigm for managing cloud-native infrastructures by enabling declarative configuration, version-controlled state, and automated reconciliation between intents and runtime deployments. Despite its widespread adoption, the performance and scalability of GitOps tools in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) scenarios are insufficiently evaluated. This paper presents a reproducible, metric-driven benchmarking, assessing the latency and resource overheads of three widely used GitOps operators: Argo CD, Flux CD, and ConfigSync. We conduct controlled experiments under both single- and multi-intent scenarios, capturing key performance indicators such as latency and resource consumption. Our results highlight trade-offs between the tools in terms of determinism, resource efficiency, and responsiveness. We further investigate a realistic orchestration scenario, using Nephio as our orchestrator, to quantify the processing latency and overhead in declarative end-to-end deployment pipelines. Our findings can offer valuable insights for tool selection and optimisation in future autonomous network orchestration systems.</description>

      <title>Low-cost Highly-interoperable Multiplatform Campus Network: Experience of YARSI University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To some organizations, building campus network is sometimes considered to be very expensive; and this has made the project uneasy to perform. Moreover, if the organization without sufficient IT knowledge does not have capable IT engineers, leaving this project to third parties without supervision would lead to unexpected larger expenses. For this reason, in the year of 2003, YARSI University formed CMIS (Center for Management Infor-mation System) to perform tasks in designing, operations and maintenance of campus network and its services. By combining Open Source operating system run on a local assembled personal computer as gateway and router, and switching technology from Cisco, we designed a low-cost UTP-based campus network which covering rooms and buildings in YARSI environment. Meanwhile the internet access through several broadband connections and dedicated wireless was shared to more than 100 simultaneous users by a captive portal system. With this strategy, we can significantly reduce cost for purchasing, maintenance and operations of network infrastructure and internet access. Our model in designing low-cost campus network and internet connections could be adopted by rural community or organizations that have limited budget to have internet access.</description>

      <title>Path-Oblivious Entanglement Swapping for the Quantum Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposed Bell pair swapping protocols, an essential component of the Quantum Internet, are planned-path: specific, structured, routing paths are reserved prior to the execution of the swapping process. This makes sense when one assumes the state used in the swapping process is expensive, fragile, and unstable. However, lessons from classical networking have shown that while reservations seem promising in concept, flexible, reservation-light or free approaches often outperform their more restrictive counterparts in well-provisioned networks. In this paper, we propose that a path-oblivious approach is more amenable to supporting swapping as quantum state evolves into a cheaper, more robust form. We formulate the swapping process as a linear program and present and evaluate a fairly naive baseline swapping protocol that tries to balance Bell pairs throughout the network. Preliminary results show that while naive balancing leaves room for improvement, investigating path-oblivious swapping is a promising direction.</description>

      <title>RepCaM++: Exploring Transparent Visual Prompt With Inference-Time Re-Parameterization for Neural Video Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, content-aware methods have been employed to reduce bandwidth and enhance the quality of Internet video delivery. These methods involve training distinct content-aware super-resolution (SR) models for each video chunk on the server, subsequently streaming the low-resolution (LR) video chunks with the SR models to the client. Prior research has incorporated additional partial parameters to customize the models for individual video chunks. However, this leads to parameter accumulation and can fail to adapt appropriately as video lengths increase, resulting in increased delivery costs and reduced performance. In this paper, we introduce RepCaM++, an innovative framework based on a novel Re-parameterization Content-aware Modulation (RepCaM) module that uniformly modulates video chunks. The RepCaM framework integrates extra parallel-cascade parameters during training to accommodate multiple chunks, subsequently eliminating these additional parameters through re-parameterization during inference. Furthermore, to enhance RepCaM's performance, we propose the Transparent Visual Prompt (TVP), which includes a minimal set of zero-initialized image-level parameters (e.g., less than 0.1%) to capture fine details within video chunks. We conduct extensive experiments on the VSD4K dataset, encompassing six different video scenes, and achieve state-of-the-art results in video restoration quality and delivery bandwidth compression.</description>

      <title>Dual Actor DDPG for Airborne STAR-RIS Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study departs from the prevailing assumption of independent Transmission and Reflection Coefficients (TRC) in Airborne Simultaneous Transmit and Reflect Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR-RIS) research. Instead, we explore a novel multi-user downlink communication system that leverages a UAV-mounted STAR-RIS (Aerial-STAR) incorporating a coupled TRC phase shift model. Our key contributions include the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, active beamforming vectors at the base station, and passive RIS TRCs to enhance communication efficiency, while considering UAV energy constraints. We design the TRC as a combination of discrete and continuous actions, and propose a novel Dual Actor Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-DDPG) algorithm. The algorithm relies on two separate actor networks for high-dimensional hybrid action space. We also propose a novel harmonic mean index (HFI)-based reward function to ensure communication fairness amongst users. For comprehensive analysis, we study the impact of RIS size on UAV aerodynamics showing that it increases drag and energy demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DA-DDPG algorithm outperforms conventional DDPG and DQN-based solutions by 24% and 97%, respectively, in accumulated reward. Three-dimensional UAV trajectory optimization achieves 28% higher communication efficiency compared to two-dimensional and altitude optimization. The HFI based reward function provides 41% lower QoS denial rates as compared to other benchmarks. The mobile Aerial-STAR system shows superior performance over fixed deployed counterparts, with the coupled phase STAR-RIS outperforming dual Transmit/Reflect RIS and conventional RIS setups. These findings highlight the potential of Aerial-STAR systems and the effectiveness of our proposed DA-DDPG approach in optimizing their performance.</description>

      <title>A Survey and Evaluation Framework for Secure DNS Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since security was not among the original design goals of the Domain Name System (herein called Vanilla DNS), many secure DNS schemes have been proposed to enhance the security and privacy of the DNS resolution process. Some proposed schemes aim to replace the existing DNS infrastructure entirely, but none have succeeded in doing so. In parallel, numerous schemes focus on improving DNS security without modifying its fundamental two-stage structure. These efforts highlight the feasibility of addressing DNS security as two distinct but compatible stages. We survey DNS resolution process attacks and threats and develop a comprehensive threat model and attack taxonomy for their systematic categorization. This analysis results in the formulation of 14 desirable security, privacy, and availability properties to mitigate the identified threats. Using these properties, we develop an objective evaluation framework and apply it to comparatively analyze 12 secure DNS schemes surveyed in this work that aim to augment the properties of the DNS resolution process. Our evaluation reveals that no single scheme provides ideal protection across the entire resolution path. Instead, the schemes tend to address a subset of properties specific to individual stages. Since these schemes targeting different stages of DNS resolution are complementary and can operate together, combining compatible schemes offers a practical and effective approach to achieving comprehensive security in the DNS resolution process.</description>

      <title>Domino: Dominant Path-based Compensation for Hardware Impairments in Modern WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi sensing faces a critical reliability challenge due to hardware-induced RF distortions, especially with modern, market-dominant WiFi cards supporting 802.11ac/ax protocols. These cards employ sensitive automatic gain control and separate RF chains, introducing complex and dynamic distortions that render existing compensation methods ineffective. In this paper, we introduce Domino, a new framework that transforms channel state information (CSI) into channel impulse response (CIR) and leverages it for precise distortion compensation. Domino is built on the key insight that hardware-induced distortions impact all signal paths uniformly, allowing the dominant static path to serve as a reliable reference for effective compensation through delay-domain processing. Real-world respiration monitoring experiments show that Domino achieves at least 2x higher mean accuracy over existing methods, maintaining robust performance with a median error below 0.24 bpm, even using a single antenna in both direct line-of-sight and obstructed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Active Inference Framework for Closed-Loop Sensing, Communication, and Control in UAV Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a core technology for 6G, and its application to closed-loop sensing, communication, and control (SCC) enables various services. Existing SCC solutions often treat sensing and control separately, leading to suboptimal performance and resource usage. In this work, we introduce the active inference framework (AIF) into SCC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for joint state estimation, control, and sensing resource allocation. By formulating a unified generative model, the problem reduces to minimizing variational free energy for inference and expected free energy for action planning. Simulation results show that both control cost and sensing cost are reduced relative to baselines.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Offshore Open Radio Access Network Using Long Short-Term Memory Models on a Novel Artificial Intelligence-Driven Cloud-Native Data Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Radio Access Network (RAN) is a critical component of modern telecommunications infrastructure, currently evolving towards disaggregated and open architectures. These advancements are pivotal for integrating intelligent, data-driven applications aimed at enhancing network reliability and operational autonomy through the introduction of cognitive capabilities, as exemplified by the emerging Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) standards. Despite its potential, the nascent nature of O-RAN technology presents challenges, primarily due to the absence of mature operational standards. This complicates the management of data and intelligent applications, particularly when integrating with traditional network management and operational support systems. Divergent vendor-specific design approaches further hinder migration and limit solution reusability. These challenges are compounded by a skills gap in telecommunications business-oriented engineering, which remains a key barrier to effective O-RAN deployment and intelligent application development. To address these challenges, Boldyn Networks developed a novel cloud-native data analytics platform, specifically designed to support scalable AI integration within O-RAN deployments. This platform underwent rigorous testing in real-world scenarios, and applied advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve operational efficiency and customer experience. Implementation involved adopting Development Operations (DevOps) practices, leveraging data lakehouse architectures tailored for AI applications, and employing sophisticated data engineering strategies. The platform successfully addresses connectivity challenges inherent in real-world offshore windfarm deployments using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for anomaly detection in network connectivity.</description>

      <title>Building the Self-Improvement Loop: Error Detection and Correction in Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>

Abstract: Error detection and correction are essential for ensuring robust and reliable operation in modern communication systems, particularly in complex transmission environments. However, discussions on these topics have largely been overlooked in semantic communication (SemCom), which focuses on transmitting meaning rather than symbols, leading to significant improvements in communication efficiency. Despite these advantages, semantic errors -- stemming from discrepancies between transmitted and received meanings -- present a major challenge to system reliability. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a comprehensive framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in SemCom systems. We formally define semantic error, detection, and correction mechanisms, and identify key sources of semantic errors. To address these challenges, we develop a Gaussian process (GP)-based method for latent space monitoring to detect errors, alongside a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (HITL-RL) approach to optimize semantic model configurations using user feedback. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in mitigating semantic errors under various conditions, including adversarial attacks, input feature changes, physical channel variations, and user preference shifts. This work lays the foundation for more reliable and adaptive SemCom systems with robust semantic error management techniques.</description>

      <title>Confidence Driven Classification of Application Types in the Presence of Background Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately classifying the application types of network traffic using deep learning models has recently gained popularity. However, we find that these classifiers do not perform well on real-world traffic data due to the presence of non-application-specific generic background traffic originating from advertisements, analytics, shared APIs, and trackers. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art application classifiers overlook such traffic in curated datasets and only classify relevant application traffic. To address this issue, when we label and train using an additional class for background traffic, it leads to additional confusion between application and background traffic, as the latter is heterogeneous and encompasses all traffic that is not relevant to the application sessions. To avoid falsely classifying background traffic as one of the relevant application types, a reliable confidence measure is warranted, such that we can refrain from classifying uncertain samples. Therefore, we design a Gaussian Mixture Model-based classification framework that improves the indication of the deep learning classifier's confidence to allow more reliable classification.</description>
