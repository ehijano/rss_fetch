      <title>Super homology groups of differential forms and vector fields on Euclidean line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arXiv:2105.09738 claims several stuffs. In particular, we recall the following two. (1) Vector fields and differential forms become a Lie superalgebra structure for each manifold. (2) For an n-dimensional Euclidean space, vector fields and differential forms with polynomial coefficients become a double weighted Lie uperalgebra. By using Euler vector field, the Betti numbers are 0 except the last one if the primary weight and the secondary weight are different. Now, a simple question arises: What happens when the primary weight and the secondary weight are equal? This note shall give a complete answer to the question for the case $n=1$.</description>

      <title>The Second Variational Formula for Statistical Biharmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the statistical bi-energy functional and its first variational formula were introduced by the author and H. Furuhata. The Maps satisfying the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation are called statistical biharmonic maps. We present the second variational formula for the statistical bi-energy functional and introduce the notion of stability. If the target statistical manifold is a Hessian manifold, it turns out that the second variational formula can be represented using the Hessian curvature. We provide examples of statistical biharmonic maps into Hessian manifolds that are significant in Hessian and information geometry. We also determine the stability of these statistical biharmonic maps, including the improper affine sphere.</description>

      <title>From tropical curves to special Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any locally planar tropical curve $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (with unit edge weights) can be realized as the limit of the rescaled moment map images of a family of special Lagrangian submanifolds in $T^*T^n$ with respect to the Euclidean structure. This is based on a gluing construction that matches special Lagrangian local models to the combinatorics of $\Gamma$, thereby establishing a direct link between tropical geometry and special Lagrangian geometry.</description>

      <title>Two Fefferman-type constructions involving almost Grassmann structures and path geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Fefferman-type construction that associates an almost Grassmannian structure of type $(2,n+1)$ to every $(n+1)$-dimensional path geometry. We prove that the construction is normal and provide two equivalent characterizing conditions for all almost Grassmannian structures which locally arise from this construction: one in terms of certain parallel tractors and the other in terms of a Weyl connection of an almost Grassmann structure. We prove that the latter condition is independent of the choice of Weyl connection.
  We then introduce a related Fefferman-type construction associating an almost Grassmannian structure of type $(2,n+1)$ to every almost Grassmannian structure of type $(2,n)$. We prove that this construction is non-normal and characterize all almost Grassmannian structures which locally arise in this way in Cartan geometric terms.</description>

      <title>The Classification of Rotationally symmetric hypersurfaces in the Heisenberg groups $H_{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the fundamental theorems for rotationally symmetric hypersurfaces, and thus, together with the earlier results in [3] and [4], provide a complete classification of umbilic hypersurfaces in the Heisenberg groups $H_{n}$. In addition, we give a complete description of generating curves for rotationally symmetric hypersurfaces with constant $p$-mean curvature $H=c$ (including $H=0$) in the Heisenberg group $H_{n}$. We also establish the validity of Alexandrov's theorem for rotationally symmetric hypersurfaces in $H_n$.</description>

      <title>Reshetnyak Majorisation and discrete upper curvature bounds for Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analogue to the Majorisation Theorem of Reshetnyak in the setting of Lorentzian length spaces with upper curvature bounds: given two future-directed timelike rectifiable curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with the same endpoints in a Lorentzian length space $X$, there exists a convex region in $\mathbb{L}^2(K)$ bounded by two future-directed causal curves $\bar \alpha$ and $\bar \beta$ with the same endpoints and a 1-anti-Lipschitz map from that region into $X$ such that $\bar \alpha$ and $\bar \beta$ are respectively mapped $\tau$-length-preservingly onto $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A special case of this theorem leads to an interesting characterisation of upper curvature bounds via four-point configurations which is truly suitable for a discrete setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish positive energy theorems for complete spin initial data sets with charge in dimensions $n \geq 4$, under a dominant energy condition and assuming the existence of at least one asymptotically flat end. Our results, formulated in the purely electric case, extend the classical theorems of Gibbons--Hull~\cite{GibbonsHull}, Gibbons--Hawking--Horowitz--Perry~\cite{GibbonsHawkingHorowitzPerry}, and Bartnik--Chru\'sciel~\cite{BartnikChrusciel}.</description>

      <title>Joyce structures from quadratic differentials on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by known examples of Joyce structures on spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials, we consider the isomonodromic deformations of particular second-order linear ODEs with rational potential. We show the infinitesimal isomonodromic deformations are the kernel of a closed $2$-form arising from the intersection pairing of an algebraic curve defined by the potential. This observation enables us to construct Joyce structures on a class of moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere, and provides a new, geometric description of the hyper-K\"ahler structures of previously computed examples. We focus on the case of moduli of quadratic differentials with poles of odd orders, where we obtain a complex hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry. We also include an example corresponding to the moduli space of quadratic differentials with four simple poles, which is a version of the classical isomonodromy problem that leads to the Painlev\'{e} VI equation.</description>

      <title>Averaged dynamics of ultra-relativisitc charged particles beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4184</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.4184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider the suitability of using the charged cold fluid model in the description of ultra-relativistic beams. The method that we have used is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and differential geometry of second order differential equations are explained. Then an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the Lorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on the space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the averaged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams described by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are similar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by the simpler {\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of these models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on the Vlasov equation and {\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The averaged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This fact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged charged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\it diameter of the distribution function}, by powers of the {\it energy of the beam} and by the time of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov equation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same. Finally, as an application of the {\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we re-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the Jacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation.</description>

      <title>Integral formulas for under/overdetermined differential operators via recovery on curves and the finite-dimensional cokernel condition I: General theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new versatile method for constructing solution operators (i.e., right-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for a wide class of underdetermined PDEs $P u = f$, which are regularizing of optimal order and, more interestingly, whose integral kernels have certain prescribed support properties. By duality, we simultaneously obtain integral representation formulas (i.e., left-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for overdetermined PDEs $P^{\ast} v = g$ with analogous properties, which lead to Poincar\'e- or Korn-type inequalities. Our method applies to operators such as the divergence, linearized scalar curvature, and linearized Einstein constraint operators (which are underdetermined), as well as the gradient, Hessian, trace-free part of the Hessian, Killing, and conformal Killing operators (which are overdetermined).
  The starting point for our construction is a condition - dubbed the recovery on curves condition (RC) - that leads to Green's functions for $P$ supported on prescribed curves. Then the desired integral solution operators (and, by duality, integral representation formulas) are obtained by taking smooth averages over a suitable family of curves. This procedure generalizes the previous constructions of Bogovskii, Oh-Tataru, and Reshetnyak. We furthermore identify a simple algebraic sufficient condition for (RC), namely, that the principal symbol $p(x, \xi)$ of $P$ is full-rank for all non-zero complex vectors $\xi$ (as opposed to real, as in ellipticity). When the principal symbol has constant coefficients, this is equivalent to (RC) and also to the condition that the formal cokernel of $P$ (without any boundary conditions) is finite-dimensional; for this reason, we call it the finite-dimensional cokernel condition (FC). We give a short proof that all operators above satisfy (FC), and thus (RC).
  Various applications will be considered in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Approximation by invariant Dirac measures on non-positively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of probability measures invariant under the geodesic flow, defined on the unit-tangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature. Building on a previous work by Coud\`ene and Schapira we introduce the set of \textit{weakly regular} vectors, denoted by $\mathcal{R}_w$: a vector in the unit tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold is weakly regular if for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, its $\epsilon$-stable set and $\epsilon$-unstable set both intersect the set $\Omega_{NF}$ of non-wandering vectors whose orbit does not bound a flat strip. We show that every ergodic probability measure supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$ can be approximated by Dirac measures supported on periodic orbits in $\Omega_{NF}$. As a consequence, ergodicity is a generic property in the space of invariant measures supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$. We illustrate our findings using a famous example of rank-one manifold attributed to Heintze and Gromov, demonstrating that in this setting the inclusion $\Omega_{NF} \subset \mathcal{R}_w$ is proper and $\mathcal{R}_w$ is the maximal subset of the unit-tangent bundle satisfying the density property stated above. Finally, as a consequence of our main result, we describe the topology of the closure of the set of ergodic probability measures and provide a complete decomposition of the space of finite invariant measures on the unit-tangent bundle of the Heintze-Gromov manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.14584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1802.02833 Guichard and Wienhard introduced the notion of $\Theta$-positivity, a generalization of Lusztig's total positivity to real Lie groups that are not necessarily split. Based on this notion, we introduce in this paper $\Theta$-positive representations of surface groups. We prove that $\Theta$-positive representations are $\Theta$-Anosov. This implies that $\Theta$-positive representations are discrete and faithful and that the set of $\Theta$-positive representations is open in the representation variety. We show that the set of $\Theta$-positive representations is closed within the set of representations that do not virtually factor through a parabolic subgroup. From this we deduce that for any simple Lie group $\mathsf G$ admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure there exist components consisting of $\Theta$-positive representations. More precisely we prove that the components parametrized using Higgs bundles methods in arXiv:2101.09377 consist of $\Theta$-positive representations.</description>

      <title>Rigid models for 2-gerbes I: Chern-Simons geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of constructing explicit geometric string structures, we give a rigid model for bundle 2-gerbes, and define connective structures thereon. This model is designed to make explicit calculations easier in applications to physics. To compare to the existing definition, we give a functorial construction of a bundle 2-gerbe as in the literature from our rigid model, including with connections. As an example we prove that the Chern--Simons bundle 2-gerbe from the literature, with its connective structure, can be rigidified -- it arises, up to isomorphism in the strongest possible sense, from a rigid bundle 2-gerbe with connective structure via this construction. Further, our rigid version of 2-gerbe trivialisation (with connections) gives rise to trivialisations (with connections) of bundle 2-gerbes in the usual sense, and as such can be used to describe geometric string structures.</description>

      <title>Harmonic $1$-forms on real loci of Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study whether there exist nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-forms on the real locus of some carefully constructed examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which would then give rise to potentially new examples of $G_2$-manifolds and an explicit description of their metrics. We do this in two steps: first, we use a neural network to compute an approximate Calabi-Yau metric on each manifold. Second, we use another neural network to compute an approximately harmonic $1$-form with respect to the approximate metric, and then inspect the found solution. On two manifolds existence of a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form can be ruled out using differential geometry. The real locus of a third manifold is diffeomorphic to $S^1 \times S^2$, and our numerics suggest that when the Calabi-Yau metric is close to a singular limit, then it admits a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form. We explain how such an approximate solution could potentially be used in a numerically verified proof for the fact that our example manifold must admit a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a 1-connected non-conformally flat conformal Lorentzian manifold $(M,c)$ admits a connected essential transitive group of conformal transformations, then there exists a metric $g\in c$ such that $(M,g)$ is a complete homogeneous plane wave. This finishes the classification of 1-connected Lorentzian manifolds, which admit transitive essential conformal group. We also prove that the group of conformal transformations of a non-conformally flat 1-connected homogeneous plane wave $(M,g)$ consists of homotheties, and it is a 1-dimensional extension of the group of isometries.</description>

      <title>The coisotropic embedding theorem for pre-symplectic manifolds: an alternative proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative proof of the Coisotropic Embedding Theorem in which the geometric choice of a connection is recast as the algebraic choice of an embedding into the cotangent bundle. The symplectic thickening is then identified as the submanifold determined by the Hamiltonian momenta conjugate to the kernel directions of the pre-symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Holonomy of K-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the horizontal holonomy group of a K-contact sub-Riemannian manifold either coincides with the holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold, or it is a codimension-one normal subgroup of the later group. The question of existence of parallel horizontal spinors, examples, and consequences are discussed.</description>

      <title>Free energy of the Coulomb gas in the determinantal case on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>A KK-theoretic perspective of quantization commutes with reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.00643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reframe Paradan-Vergne's approach to quantization commutes with reduction in KK-theory through a recent formalism introduced by Kasparov, focusing more especially the index theoretic parts that lead to their "Witten non-abelian localization formula". While our method uses the same ingredients as their's in spirit, interesting conceptual simplifications occur, and the relationship to the Ma-Tian-Zhang analytic approach becomes quite transparent.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow of phase transitions with fixed contact angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gradient flow of the Allen-Cahn equation with fixed boundary contact angle in Euclidean domains for initial data with bounded energy. Under general assumptions, we establish both interior and boundary convergence properties for the solutions and associated energy measures. Under various boundary non-concentration assumptions, we show that, for almost every time, the associated limiting varifolds satisfy generalised contact angle conditions and have bounded first variation, as well as deducing that the trace of the limit of the solutions coincides with the limit of their traces. Moreover, we derive an Ilmanen type monotonicity formula, for initial data with bounded energy, valid for the associated energy measures up to the boundary.</description>
