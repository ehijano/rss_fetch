      <title>Fourier transforms of orthogonal structures on the paraboloid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to obtain Fourier transforms of multivariate orthogonal structures on the paraboloid such as Laguerre polynomials on the paraboloid and Jacobi polynomials on the paraboloid, and to define two new families of multivariate orthogonal functions by using Parseval's identity. In addition, some contiguous relations for these families of functions are given, and the obtained results are expressed in terms of the continuous Hahn polynomials.</description>

      <title>Orlicz spaces and the uncertainty principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a finite signal. The classical uncertainty principle tells us that the product of the support of $f$ and the support of $\hat{f}$, the Fourier transform of $f$, must satisfy $|supp(f)|\cdot|supp(\hat{f})|\geq |G|$. Recently, Iosevich and Mayeli improved the uncertainty principle for signals with Fourier supported on generic sets. This was done by employing the Fourier restriction theory in $L^p$ spaces. In this paper, we extended the $(p,q)$-restriction setting to Orlicz spaces. Then we apply uncertainty principles to the problem of exact recovery, which again extends and recovers the result that Iosevich and Mayeli obtained in Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals involving non-monotonic derivators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the concept of the Stieltjes derivative to encompass left-continuous derivators with locally bounded variation, thereby relaxing the monotonicity constraint. This generalization necessitates a refined definition of the Stieltjes derivative applicable across the entire domain, accommodating derivators that may change sign. We establish a generalized Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral in this broader context, presenting both "almost-everywhere" and "everywhere" versions. The latter requires a specific condition relating the derivator to its variation function, which we prove to be optimal through a density theorem. Our framework bridges the gap between Stieltjes differential equations and measure differential equations, offering a tool for modeling complex systems with non-monotonic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A\subset \mathbf{N}$ be a finite set of $n=|A|$ positive integers, and consider the cosine sum $f_A(t)=\sum_{a\in A}\cos at$. We prove that there exists an absolute constant $c\geqslant 1/12$ such that $$\min_t f_A(t)\leqslant -\Omega(n^c),$$ establishing polynomial bounds for the Chowla cosine problem.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Driven Adaptive Surrogate Modeling for Simulation and Optimization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a surrogate model refinement approach for the simulation of dynamical systems and the solution of optimization problems governed by dynamical systems in which surrogates replace expensive-to-compute state- and control-dependent component functions in the dynamics or objective function. For example, trajectory simulation and optimization tasks for an aircraft depend on aerodynamic coefficient functions whose evaluation requires expensive computational fluid dynamics simulations for every value of the state and control encountered in simulation and optimization algorithms, which would result in prohibitively long run times, often exacerbated further by the lack of derivative information. To overcome this bottleneck, this work employs differentiable surrogates that are computed from values of the true component functions at a few points. The proposed approach updates the current surrogates on an as-needed basis as follows: given a surrogate and corresponding solution of the simulation or optimization problem, the approach combines solution sensitivity information with pointwise error estimates between the true component functions and their surrogates to define an acquisition function that is used to determine new points at which to evaluate the true component function to refine the surrogate. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a numerical example of a notional hypersonic vehicle with aerodynamic coefficient models that are approximated using kernel interpolation.</description>

      <title>On Isospectral flows related to (dual) cubic strings: Novikov, DP peakons and B, C-Toda lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Degasperis--Procesi (DP) equation can be viewed as an isospectral deformation of the boundary value problem for the so-called cubic string, while the Novikov equation can be formally regarded as linked to the dual cubic string. However, their relationships have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper examines various intrinsic connections between these two systems from different perspectives. We uncover a bijective relationship between the DP and Novikov pure peakon trajectories. In particular, this allows us to derive, not previously known, explicit expressions for the constants of motion in the Novikov peakon dynamical system. We also establish a one-to-one correspondence between the corresponding discrete cubic and dual cubic boundary value problems. Furthermore, we propose a new integrable lattice that features bilinear relations involving both determinants and Pfaffians, demonstrating that it can be connected to both the B-Toda and C-Toda lattices, which correspond to isospectral flows, involving positive powers of the spectral parameter, associated with (dual) cubic strings.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Information Bounds for Distances and Orthogonal Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop quantitative algorithmic information bounds for orthogonal projections and distances in the plane. Under mild independence conditions, the distance $|x-y|$ and a projection coordinate $p_e x$ each retain at least half the algorithmic information content of $x$ in the sense of finite-precision Kolmogorov complexity, up to lower-order terms. Our bounds support conditioning on coarser approximations, enabling case analyses across precision scales. The proofs introduce a surrogate point selection step. Via the point-to-set principle we derive a new bound on the Hausdorff dimension of pinned distance sets, showing that every analytic set $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\dim_H(E)\leq 1$ satisfies
  \[\sup_{x\in E}\dim_H(\Delta_x E)\geq \frac{3}{4}\dim_H(E).\]
  We also extend Bourgain's theorem on exceptional sets for orthogonal projections to all sets that admit optimal Hausdorff oracles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$, let $E$ be a compact subset of the $d$-dimensional moment curve in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $N(E,\varepsilon) \lesssim \varepsilon^{-\alpha}$ for $0 &lt;\varepsilon &lt;1$ where $N(E,\varepsilon)$ is the smallest number of $\varepsilon$-balls needed to cover $E$. We proved that if $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with \begin{align*}
  1 \leq p\leq p_\alpha:=
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{d^2+d+2\alpha}{2\alpha} &amp; d \geq 3,
  \frac{4}{\alpha} &amp;d =2,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*} and $\widehat{f}$ is supported on the set $E$, then $f$ is identically zero. We also proved that the range of $p$ is optimal by considering random Cantor sets on the moment curve. We extended the result of Guo, Iosevich, Zhang and Zorin-Kranich, including the endpoint. We also considered applications of our results to the failure of the restriction estimates and Wiener Tauberian Theorem.</description>

Abstract: Vasin (for $n=1$) and Anderson, Lehrb\"ack, Mudarra, and V\"ah\"akangas (arXiv:2209.06284) (for $n&gt;1$) provided a geometric characterization of the sets $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ so that $w = \text{dist}(\cdot, E)^{-\alpha}$ is a Muckenhoupt $A_1$ weight for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. In this paper, we provide a geometric characterization of the sets $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (which we call median porous sets) so that $w = \text{dist}(\cdot, E)^{-\alpha}$ is a Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weight for some $\alpha &gt; 0$ (given any $1 &lt; p \leq \infty$).
  Given $1 &lt; p \leq \infty$, we also find the precise range of exponents $\alpha$ so that $w = \text{dist}(\cdot, E)^{-\alpha} \in A_p$, in analogy to the $p=1$ case done in arXiv:2209.06284.
  With our characterization we prove that $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus E$ supports a Hardy-Sobolev inequality if $E$ is an appropriate median porous set. All previous such results that we are aware of make the strictly stronger assumption that the set $E$ is porous, e.g. arXiv:1705.01360, arXiv:1502.01190. As far as we know, this is the first instance in the literature that the ``porosity barrier" is broken in this context.
  Examples of such appropriate median porous (but not porous) sets were known. We provide further such examples, additional applications to weighted Poincar\'e inequalities, and a geometric characterization of the nonnegative H\"older continuous functions $w$ such that $\log (w) \in BMO$.
  We prove that two of the methods we use ($A_p$ and Riesz potential methods) are sharp, i.e. they cannot be improved beyond the results we obtain.
  The proofs rely on a new median-value characterization of $BMO$: For a real-valued measurable function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and constants $0 &lt; s &lt; t &lt; 1$,
  \[\|f\|_{BMO} \approx_{s, t, n} \sup_{Q}[M_t(f, Q) - M_s(f, Q)]\]
  where $M_s(f, Q)$ denotes the $s$-median value of $f$ on $Q$.</description>

Abstract: We improve the best known lower bound for the dimension of radial projections of sets in the plane. We show that if $X,Y$ are Borel sets in $\R^2$, $X$ is not contained in any line and $\dim_H(X)&gt;0$, then
  $$\sup\limits_{x\in X} \dim_H(\pi_x Y) \geq \min\left\{(\dim_H(Y) + \dim_H(X))/2, \dim_H(Y), 1\right\},$$ where $\pi_x Y$ is the radial projection of the set $Y$ from the point $x$.</description>

      <title>Pascal's Matrix, Point Counting on Elliptic Curves and Prolate Spheroidal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenvectors of the $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ symmetric Pascal matrix $T_N$ are analogs of prolate spheroidal wave functions in the discrete setting. The generating functions of the eigenvectors of $T_N$ are prolate spheroidal functions in the sense that they are simultaneously eigenfunctions of a third-order differential operator and an integral operator over the critical line $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \text{Re}(z) = 1/2\}$. For even, positive integers $N$, we obtain an explicit formula for the generating function of an eigenvector of the symmetric pascal matrix with eigenvalue $1$. In the special case when $N=p-1$ for an odd prime $p$, we show that the generating function is equivalent modulo $p$ to $(\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)-1)^2$, where $\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)$ is the number of points on the Legendre elliptic curve $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-z)$ over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$.</description>
