      <title>Uncovering the Viral Nature of Toxicity in Competitive Online Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxicity is a widespread phenomenon in competitive online video games. In addition to its direct undesirable effects, there is a concern that toxicity can spread to others, amplifying the harm caused by a single player's misbehavior. In this study, we estimate whether and to what extent a player's toxic speech spreads, causing their teammates to behave similarly. To this end, we analyze proprietary data from the free-to-play first-person action game Call of Duty: Warzone. We formulate and implement an instrumental variable identification strategy that leverages the network of interactions among players across matches. Our analysis reveals that all else equal, all of a player's teammates engaging in toxic speech increases their probability of engaging in similar behavior by 26.1 to 30.3 times the average player's likelihood of engaging in toxic speech. These findings confirm the viral nature of toxicity, especially toxic speech, in competitive online video games.</description>

      <title>Code Interviews: Design and Evaluation of a More Authentic Assessment for Introductory Programming Assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence poses new challenges around assessment and academic integrity, increasingly driving introductory programming educators to employ invigilated exams often conducted in-person on pencil-and-paper. But the structure of exams often fails to accommodate authentic programming experiences that involve planning, implementing, and debugging programs with computer interaction.
  In this experience report, we describe code interviews: a more authentic assessment method for take-home programming assignments. Through action research, we experimented with varying the number and type of questions as well as whether interviews were conducted individually or with groups of students. To scale the program, we converted most of our weekly teaching assistant (TA) sections to conduct code interviews on 5 major weekly take-home programming assignments. By triangulating data from 5 sources, we identified 4 themes. Code interviews (1) pushed students to discuss their work, motivating more nuanced but sometimes repetitive insights; (2) enabled peer learning, reducing stress in some ways but increasing stress in other ways; (3) scaled with TA-led sections, replacing familiar practice with an unfamiliar assessment; (4) focused on student contributions, limiting opportunities for TAs to give guidance and feedback.
  We conclude by discussing the different decisions about the design of code interviews with implications for student experience, academic integrity, and teaching workload.</description>

      <title>Teaching Cloud Infrastructure and Scalable Application Deployment in an Undergraduate Computer Science Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making successful use of cloud computing for deploying scalable web applications requires nuanced approaches to both system design and deployment methodology, involving reasoning about the elasticity, cost, and security models of cloud services. Students commonly interact with cloud abstractions early in their technical careers, including during internships and academic research. Building cloud-native applications without a firm understanding of the fundamentals of cloud engineering can leave students susceptible to cost and security pitfalls common to cloud platforms. Yet, cloud computing is not commonly taught at the undergraduate level, because the technology and practices behind modern cloud deployment, such as containerization and infrastructure-as-code (IaC), have only recently matured into a set of general principles independent from specific providers' offerings. To address this gap, we designed an undergraduate-level course around these principles that framed cloud infrastructure deployment as a software engineering practice in support of scalable web applications, emphasizing the value of both cloud deployment and application design skills in building robust cloud-native systems. Our course featured a number of hands-on assignments that gave students experience with modern, best-practice concepts and tools such as IaC, containerization, observability, serverless computing, and continuous integration and deployment. We describe the design of the course, our experience teaching its initial offering in Winter 2024, and provide our reflections on what worked well and potential areas for improvement. Our course material is publicly available at https://infracourse.cloud.</description>

      <title>Impact of Knowledge Silos on Responsible AI Practices in Journalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective adoption of responsible AI practices in journalism requires a concerted effort to bridge different perspectives, including technological, editorial, journalistic, and managerial. Among the many challenges that could impact information sharing around responsible AI inside news organizations are knowledge silos, where information is isolated within one part of the organization and not easily shared with others. This study aims to explore if, and if so, how, knowledge silos affect the adoption of responsible AI practices in journalism through a cross-case study of four major Dutch media outlets. We examine the individual and organizational barriers to AI knowledge sharing and the extent to which knowledge silos could impede the operationalization of responsible AI initiatives inside newsrooms. To address this question, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with editors, managers, and journalists at de Telegraaf, de Volkskrant, the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS), and RTL Nederland. The interviews aimed to uncover insights into the existence of knowledge silos, their effects on responsible AI practice adoption, and the organizational practices influencing these dynamics. Our results emphasize the importance of creating better structures for sharing information on AI across all layers of news organizations.</description>

      <title>A Thematic Framework for Analyzing Large-scale Self-reported Social Media Data on Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Using Buprenorphine Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: One of the key FDA-approved medications for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is buprenorphine. Despite its popularity, individuals often report various information needs regarding buprenorphine treatment on social media platforms like Reddit. However, the key challenge is to characterize these needs. In this study, we propose a theme-based framework to curate and analyze large-scale data from social media to characterize self-reported treatment information needs (TINs).
  Methods: We collected 15,253 posts from r/Suboxone, one of the largest Reddit sub-community for buprenorphine products. Following the standard protocol, we first identified and defined five main themes from the data and then coded 6,000 posts based on these themes, where one post can be labeled with applicable one to three themes. Finally, we determined the most frequently appearing sub-themes (topics) for each theme by analyzing samples from each group.
  Results: Among the 6,000 posts, 40.3% contained a single theme, 36% two themes, and 13.9% three themes. The most frequent topics for each theme or theme combination came with several key findings - prevalent reporting of psychological and physical effects during recovery, complexities in accessing buprenorphine, and significant information gaps regarding medication administration, tapering, and usage of substances during different stages of recovery. Moreover, self-treatment strategies and peer-driven advice reveal valuable insights and potential misconceptions.
  Conclusions: The findings obtained using our proposed framework can inform better patient education and patient-provider communication, design systematic interventions to address treatment-related misconceptions and rumors, and streamline the generation of hypotheses for future research.</description>

      <title>Scaffolding Research Projects in Theory of Computing Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory of Computing (ToC) is an important course in CS curricula because of its connections to other CS courses as a foundation for them. Traditional ToC course grading schemes are mostly exam-based, and sometimes a small weight for traditional proof-type assignments. Recent work experimented with a new type of assignment, namely a ``mock conference'' project wherein students approach and present ToC problems as if they were submitting to a ``real'' CS conference. In this paper we massively scaffold this existing project and provide our experiences in running such a conference in our own ToC course.</description>

      <title>"For Us By Us": Intentionally Designing Technology for Lived Black Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HCI research to date has only scratched the surface of the unique approaches racially minoritized communities take to building, designing, and using technology systems. While there has been an increase in understanding how people across racial groups create community across different platforms, there is still a lack of studies that explicitly center on how Black technologists design with and for their own communities. In this paper, we present findings from a series of semi-structured interviews with Black technologists who have used, created, or curated resources to support lived Black experiences. From their experiences, we find a multifaceted approach to design as a means of survival, to stay connected, for cultural significance, and to bask in celebratory joy. Further, we provide considerations that emphasize the need for centering lived Black experiences in design and share approaches that can empower the broader research community to conduct further inquiries into design focused on those in the margins.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Aware Response Generation Using Affect-Enriched Embeddings with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a need for empathetic and coherent responses in automated chatbot-facilitated psychotherapy sessions. This study addresses the challenge of enhancing the emotional and contextual understanding of large language models (LLMs) in psychiatric applications. We introduce a novel framework that integrates multiple emotion lexicons, including NRC Emotion Lexicon, VADER, WordNet, and SentiWordNet, with state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLAMA 2, Flan-T5, ChatGPT 3.0, and ChatGPT 4.0. The primary dataset comprises over 2,000 therapy session transcripts from the Counseling and Psychotherapy database, covering discussions on anxiety, depression, trauma, and addiction. We segment the transcripts into smaller chunks, enhancing them with lexical features and computing embeddings using BERT, GPT-3, and RoBERTa to capture semantic and emotional nuances. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database, enabling efficient similarity search and clustering based on cosine similarity. Upon user query, the most relevant segments are retrieved and provided as context to the LLMs, significantly improving the models' ability to generate empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that in-corporating emotion lexicons enhances empathy, coherence, informativeness, and fluency scores. Our findings highlight the critical role of emotional embeddings in improving LLM performance for psychotherapy.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women's Contribution to Public Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its promise of openness and inclusiveness, the development of free and open source software (FOSS) remains significantly unbalanced in terms of gender representation among contributors. To assist open source project maintainers and communities in addressing this imbalance, it is crucial to understand the causes of this inequality.In this study, we aim to establish how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the ability of women to contribute to public code. To do so, we use the Software Heritage archive, which holds the largest dataset of commits to public code, and the difference in differences (DID) methodology from econometrics that enables the derivation of causality from historical data.Our findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted women's ability to contribute to the development of public code, relatively to men. Further, our observations of specific contributor subgroups indicate that COVID-19 particularly affected women hobbyists, identified using contribution patterns and email address domains.</description>

      <title>Moral Alignment for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</description>

      <title>You are what you eat? Feeding foundation models a regionally diverse food dataset of World Wide Dishes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, used in everyday tasks such as text-image searches, interactions with chatbots, and content generation. As use increases, so does concern over the disparities in performance and fairness of these models for different people in different parts of the world. To assess these growing regional disparities, we present World Wide Dishes, a mixed text and image dataset consisting of 765 dishes, with dish names collected in 131 local languages. World Wide Dishes has been collected purely through human contribution and decentralised means, by creating a website widely distributed through social networks. Using the dataset, we demonstrate a novel means of operationalising capability and representational biases in foundation models such as language models and text-to-image generative models. We enrich these studies with a pilot community review to understand, from a first-person perspective, how these models generate images for people in five African countries and the United States.
  We find that these models generally do not produce quality text and image outputs of dishes specific to different regions. This is true even for the US, which is typically considered to be more well-resourced in training data - though the generation of US dishes does outperform that of the investigated African countries. The models demonstrate a propensity to produce outputs that are inaccurate as well as culturally misrepresentative, flattening, and insensitive. These failures in capability and representational bias have the potential to further reinforce stereotypes and disproportionately contribute to erasure based on region. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/oxai/world-wide-dishes/.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Copyright Disputes and Generative AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to analyzing copyright infringement disputes by formalizing relevant judicial principles within a coherent framework based on the random-worlds method. The approach provides a structured analysis of key evidentiary principles, with particular emphasis on the "inverse ratio rule"--a controversial doctrine adopted by some courts. Although this rule has faced significant criticism, a formal proof demonstrates its validity, provided it is properly defined. Additionally, the paper examines the heightened copyright risks posed by generative AI, highlighting how extensive access to copyrighted material by generative models increases the risk of infringement. Utilizing the probabilistic approach, the Near Access-Free (NAF) condition, previously proposed as a potential mitigation strategy, is evaluated. The analysis reveals that while the NAF condition mitigates some infringement risks, its justifiability and efficacy are questionable in certain contexts. These findings demonstrate how a rigorous probabilistic approach can advance our understanding of copyright jurisprudence and its interaction with emerging technologies.</description>

Abstract: Mobile phone data have played a key role in quantifying human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing studies on mobility patterns have primarily focused on regional aggregates in high-income countries, obfuscating the accentuated impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging geolocation data from mobile-phone users and population census for 6 middle-income countries across 3 continents between March and December 2020, we uncovered common disparities in the behavioral response to the pandemic across socioeconomic groups. Users living in low-wealth neighborhoods were less likely to respond by self-isolating, relocating to rural areas, or refraining from commuting to work. The gap in the behavioral responses between socioeconomic groups persisted during the entire observation period. Among users living in low-wealth neighborhoods, those who commute to work in high-wealth neighborhoods pre-pandemic were particularly at risk of experiencing economic stress, facing both the reduction in economic activity in the high-wealth neighborhood and being more likely to be affected by public transport closures due to their longer commute distances. While confinement policies were predominantly country-wide, these results suggest that, when data to identify vulnerable individuals are not readily available, GPS-based analytics could help design targeted place-based policies to aid the most vulnerable.</description>

      <title>Web3 and the State: Indian state's redescription of blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article closely reads a discussion paper by the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog and a strategy paper by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) advocating non-financial use cases of blockchain in India. By noting the discursive shift from transparency to trust to adjustably transparent enacted in these two documents, and consequently the Indian state's redescription of blockchain, the paper foregrounds how blockchain systems are being designated as "decentral" but have recentralizing effects where the state reinvents and re-establishes itself as an intermediary. The paper illustrates how discursive shifts concerning trust, transparency, (de)centralization and (dis)intermediation are crucial sites for investigating redescriptions of emerging sociotechnical systems.</description>
