      <title>Probing time-reversal symmetry breaking at microwave frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments carried out in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, we explore electromagnetic signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at microwave frequencies, using as a prototypical example a semiclassical conductor in a magnetic field. TRSB is generically accompanied by a skew-symmetric term in the electrodynamic response tensors (permittivity, conductivity, surface impedance), imparting a nonreciprocal phase shift to left- and right-circularly polarized electromagnetic waves reflected from the surface of such a material. We show that TRSB manifests as a difference in the surface reactance experienced by circularly polarized waves, and can be detected using a doubly degenerate resonator mode, such as the TE$_{111}$ mode of a cylindrical cavity. In addition to the frequency splitting induced by TRSB we show that, when interrogated by circularly polarized microwaves, the forward and reverse transmission responses of such a resonator break reciprocity, providing a crucial signature that distinguishes true Faraday effects (i.e., circular birefringence) from non-TRSB effects such as linear birefringence. In the limit that the sample is larger than the spot size (i.e., larger than the diameter of the microwave cavity) we show that the TRSB resonator has sensitivity to polar Kerr angle comparable to that of the zero-loop-area Sagnac, and should provide complementary insights into unconventional superconductors such as UPt$_3$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ that have been observed to spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth of gold films on the elemental superconductors V(100), Nb(100) and Nb(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies require a new generation of superconducting electronic devices and circuitry. However, the superconducting materials used to construct them are restricted to a class of bulk superconductors. Gold films grown in contact with superconducting materials can exhibit superconducting correlations through the proximity effect, with various possible implementations in quantum technology. Here, we study the growth of flat Au films on various surfaces of the elemental superconductors vanadium and niobium through a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In particular, we investigate the growth morphology and composition as a function of temperature and coverage. We find that gold films can grow flat and oxygen-free when annealed to sufficiently high temperatures; however, they are also susceptible to partial intermixing with the substrate elements. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements elucidate the emergence of a proximitized superconducting gap at the gold surface. Additionally, we demonstrate the survival of the magnetic state of FeTPP-Cl molecules on the surface of these gold films, proving that they behave as a good support for probing molecular magnetism. We found that the exchange interaction between the molecular spin and the superconducting condensate can be inferred by the measurement of sub-gap Yu-Shiva-Rusinov states. Our work shows that proximitised Au films constitute a promising platform to explore on-superconducting-surface synthesis and the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism in a large spin-orbit coupling environment.</description>

      <title>Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Current Conservation in the Self-Consistent Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are generally not current-conserving. We introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of quasi-1D JJs with current conservation, with phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads matching the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard methods and calculate the current-phase relationship (CPR) for superconductor--normal metal--superconductor JJs with different gate voltages applied to the normal metal. We show that our approach can weaken or even reverse forward skewedness of the CPR.</description>

      <title>Measuring superconducting arcs by ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is the leading tool for studying the symmetry and structure of the order parameter in superconductors. The recent improvement of the technique made it possible to detect the superconducting energy gap at the surface of topological t-PtBi2 via observation of the record-breaking narrow line shapes. The promising new physics uncovered requires further investigation of the spectral and gap functions of t-PtBi2, but the challenging experimental conditions severely limit the application of conventional ARPES setups. In this work, we use synchrotron-based measurements and show that the gap at the surface Fermi arc in t-PtBi2 can be detected even with more relaxed experimental conditions than in our previous laser-based studies. At the same time, using simple model of ARPES spectra, we identify the minimum requirements to detect the gap and consider cases where the gap cannot be resolved.</description>

      <title>Origin of local magnetic exchange interaction in infiite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant magnetic exchange interactions have been observed in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO2 (R = La, Pr, Nd), which exhibit unconventional superconductivity upon hole doping. Despite their structural and Fermi surface similarities to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates possess a larger charge transfer gap, which influences their magnetic exchange interactions via oxygen. In this work, we performed 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on LaNiO2 and Sr-doped LaNiO2, revealing glassy spin dynamics originating from Ni-O planes. This indicates that infinite-layer nickelates are in proximity to magnetic ordering and that magnetic correlations play a crucial role in their physics. More importantly, our analysis of the Knight shift and hyperfine coupling of 17O nuclei revealed that the Ni-Ni superexchange interaction, mediated by the {\sigma} bond between the Ni-dx2-y2 and O-p orbitals, is one order of magnitude weaker than that in cuprates. This alone cannot account for the total magnetic exchange interaction observed in nickelates. First-principles many-body calculations indicate that an interstitial s orbital near the Fermi level, coupled with the Ni-d3z2-r2 orbital, significantly enhances the superexchange interaction. This contrasts with cuprates, where magnetic interactions are predominantly governed by Cu-dx2-y2 superexchange via oxygen. Our findings provide new insights into the distinct magnetic interactions in infinite-layer nickelates and their potential role in unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Bulk superinsulation and polar nematic order in nanopatterned NbTiN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental evidence of 3D superinsulation in a nanopatterned slab of NbTiN, given by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) scaling of the conductance when approaching the critical temperature from above and by the vanishing of the conductance below the transition. In the electric Meissner state, we find polar nematic order arising from ferroelectric alignement of short electric strings excited by external electromagnetic fields. Our results prove that superinsulation appears also in ordered structures provided that these are large enough, thereby confirming the origin of superinsulation as electric confinement, independent of disorder.</description>

      <title>Symmetry properties of pair correlations in heavy deformed nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a combination of Majorana edge modes (MEMs) and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) located in the vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors represent a new platform for the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum gates. By calculating the full many-body dynamics of the system, we demonstrate the successful simulation and visualization of $Z$-, $X$- and Hadamard gates, with MEMs being functionalized as quantum memory. Our results open a new platform for the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>InvDesFlow-AL: Active Learning-based Workflow for Inverse Design of Functional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis, energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process. However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96% improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models. Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study is motivated by a difficulty to reconcile between particle number conservation and superconductivity. An alternative modeling, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously ocuurs in quantum systems, is explored. The Fermi-Hubbard mode is employed to demonstrate a disentanglement-induced quantum phase transition into a state having a finite superconducting order parameter. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on Josephson junction's current phase relation is explored.</description>

      <title>Field-induced electronic correlations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$ beyond 40~T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several superconducting phases have been discovered close to a metamagnetic transition in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$, unveiling a close relation between its superconducting and magnetic properties. Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the critical current density, superconducting coherence length, and superconducting transition temperature of single-domain, epitaxially-grown Nb(110)/Au(111)/Nb(110) trilayers, all of which show a non-monotonic dependence on the thickness of the Au layer. These results are compared with the predictions of a relativistic, ab-initio theory, which incorporates superconducting correlations. We find good agreement with experiment, coming from a rich interplay between superconducting proximity - and quantum size effects, mediated by Andreev bound states. These results suggest that quantum size effects could provide a systematic method of controlling the transport properties of superconducting multilayers.</description>

      <title>Praseodymium doping effect on the superconducting properties of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ bulks under ambient and high-pressure growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ (Fe$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Se$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$; $x = 0$ to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature ($T_c^{\rm onset}$) by 1.5 K and the critical current density ($J_c$) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Se$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr-doping, whereas $J_c$ of Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr-doping at Fe sites preserves $T_c^{\rm onset}$ and improves $J_c$ of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve $J_c$ properties without affecting $T_c^{\rm onset}$ through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB$_2$.</description>

      <title>Bending-strain effects in conventional superconductors and superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effect of bending-strain in thin films of clean, conventional superconductors (S), and the proximity-induced effect of this strain in SN bilayers with a normal metal (N), and SNS junctions with equal curvatures in each superconductor. We find that the effective spin-orbit coupling due to strain in the superconductor induces both spin-polarized and unequal-spin even-frequency p-wave triplet pairings throughout the superconductor. When interfaced with a normal metal, additional odd-frequency pairings are induced, and their magnitudes can be tuned with the strain. In SNS junctions, the strain alone can induce a superconducting spin current in the junction. The spin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\pi$-transition, resulting in an in-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the strain. We discuss the underlying physics and its implications for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</description>

      <title>DC-driven separation of fractional flux quanta in two-band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</description>
