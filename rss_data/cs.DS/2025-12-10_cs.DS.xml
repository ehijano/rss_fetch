      <title>The Bichromatic Two-Center Problem on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the (weighted) bichromatic two-center problem on graphs. The input consists of a graph $G$ of $n$ (weighted) vertices and $m$ edges, and a set $\mathcal{P}$ of pairs of distinct vertices, where no vertex appears in more than one pair. The problem aims to find two points (i.e., centers) on $G$ by assigning vertices of each pair to different centers so as to minimize the maximum (weighted) distance of vertices to their assigned centers (so that the graph can be bi-colored with this goal). To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied on graphs, including tree graphs. In this paper, we propose an $O(m^2n\log n\log mn)$ algorithm for solving the problem on an undirected graph provided with the distance matrix, an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm for the problem on trees, and a linear-time approach for the unweighted tree version.</description>

      <title>A tight example for approximation ratio 5 for covering small cuts by the primal-dual method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Small Cuts Cover problem we seek to cover by a min-cost edge-set the set family of cuts of size/capacity $&lt;k$ of a graph. Recently, Simmons showed that the primal-dual algorithm of Williamson, Goemans, Mihail, and Vazirani achieves approximation ratio $5$ for this problem, and asked whether this bound is tight. We will answer this question positively, by providing an example in which the ratio between the solution produced by the primal-dual algorithm and the optimum is arbitrarily close to $5$.</description>

      <title>A Distribution Testing Approach to Clustering Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following distribution clustering problem: Given a hidden partition of $k$ distributions into two groups, such that the distributions within each group are the same, and the two distributions associated with the two clusters are $\varepsilon$-far in total variation, the goal is to recover the partition. We establish upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity for two fundamental cases: (1) when one of the cluster's distributions is known, and (2) when both are unknown. Our upper and lower bounds characterize the sample complexity's dependence on the domain size $n$, number of distributions $k$, size $r$ of one of the clusters, and distance $\varepsilon$. In particular, we achieve tightness with respect to $(n,k,r,\varepsilon)$ (up to an $O(\log k)$ factor) for all regimes.</description>

      <title>Finding All Bounded-Length Simple Cycles in a Directed Graphs - Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Gupta and Suzumura proposed a novel algorithm for enumerating all bounded-length simple cycles in directed graphs. In this work, we present concrete examples demonstrating that the proposed algorithm fails to enumerate certain valid cycles. Via these examples, we perform a detailed analysis pinpointing the specific points at which the proofs exhibit logical gaps. Furthermore, we propose a corrected formulation that resolves these issues while preserving the desirable property that the algorithm's computational complexity remains $O((c + 1) \cdot k \cdot (n + e))$ where $c$ is the number of simple cycles of a specified maximum length $k$, and $n$ and $e$ the number of graph nodes and edges respectively.</description>

      <title>Weighted $k$-Path and Other Problems in Almost $O^*(2^k)$ Deterministic Time via Dynamic Representative Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data structure that we call a Dynamic Representative Set. In its most basic form, it is given two parameters $0&lt; k &lt; n$ and allows us to maintain a representation of a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. It supports basic update operations (unioning of two families, element convolution) and a query operation that determines for a set $B \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ whether there is a set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ of size at most $k-|B|$ such that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. After $2^{k+O(\sqrt{k}\log^2k)}n \log n$ preprocessing time, all operations use $2^{k+O(\sqrt{k}\log^2k)}\log n$ time.
  Our data structure has many algorithmic consequences that improve over previous works. One application is a deterministic algorithm for the Weighted Directed $k$-Path problem, one of the central problems in parameterized complexity. Our algorithm takes as input an $n$-vertex directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge lengths and an integer $k$, and it outputs the minimum edge length of a path on $k$ vertices in $2^{k+O(\sqrt{k}\log^2k)}(n+m)\log n$ time (in the word RAM model where weights fit into a single word). Modulo the lower order term $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log^2k)}$, this answers a question that has been repeatedly posed as a major open problem in the field.</description>

      <title>Fast exact algorithms via the Matrix Tree Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast exact algorithms are known for Hamiltonian paths in undirected and directed bipartite graphs through elegant though involved algorithms that are quite different from each other. We devise algorithms that are simple and similar to each other while having the same upper bounds. The common features of these algorithms is the use of the Matrix-Tree theorem and sieving using roots of unity.
  Next, we use the framework to provide alternative algorithms to count perfect matchings in bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices, i.e., computing the $\{0,1\}$-permanent of a square $n/2 \times n/2$ matrix which runs in a time similar to Ryser.
  We demonstrate the flexibility of our method by counting the number of ways to vertex partition the graph into $k$-stars (a $k$-star consist of a tree with a root having $k-1$ children that are all leaves). Interestingly, our running time improves to $O^*((1+\epsilon_k)^n)$ with $\epsilon_k \rightarrow 0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$.
  As an aside, making use of Bj\"orklund's algorithm for exact counting perfect matchings in general graphs, we show that the count of maximum matchings can be computed in time $O^*(2^\nu)$ where $\nu$ is the size of a maximum matching. The crucial ingredient here is the famous Gallai-Edmonds decomposition theorem.
  All our algorithms run in polynomial space.</description>

      <title>Parallel Batch Dynamic Vertex Coloring in $O(\log \Delta)$ Amortized Update Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first parallel batch-dynamic algorithm for maintaining a proper $(\Delta + 1)$-vertex coloring. Our approach builds on a new sequential dynamic algorithm inspired by the work of Bhattacharya et al. (SODA'18). The resulting randomized algorithm achieves $O(\log \Delta)$ expected amortized update time and, for any batch of $b$ updates, has parallel span $O(\operatorname{polylog} b + \operatorname{polylog} n)$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>Two-Edge Connectivity via Pac-Man Gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph (2-ECSS) problem: Given a graph $G$, compute a connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ with the minimum number of edges such that $H$ is spanning, i.e., $V(H) = V(G)$, and $H$ is 2-edge-connected, i.e., $H$ remains connected upon the deletion of any single edge, if such an $H$ exists. The $2$-ECSS problem is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we provide a polynomial-time $(\frac 5 4 + \varepsilon)$-approximation for the problem for an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon&gt;0$, improving the previous best approximation ratio of $\frac{13}{10}+\varepsilon$.
  Our improvement is based on two main innovations: First, we reduce solving the problem on general graphs to solving it on structured graphs with high vertex connectivity. This high vertex connectivity ensures the existence of a 4-matching across any bipartition of the vertex set with at least 10 vertices in each part. Second, we exploit this property in a later gluing step, where isolated 2-edge-connected components need to be merged without adding too many edges. Using the 4-matching property, we can repeatedly glue a huge component (containing at least 10 vertices) to other components. This step is reminiscent of the Pac-Man game, where a Pac-Man (a huge component) consumes all the dots (other components) as it moves through a maze. These two innovations lead to a significantly simpler algorithm and analysis for the gluing step compared to the previous best approximation algorithm, which required a long and tedious case analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Makespan Scheduling under Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a natural extension of online makespan scheduling on identical parallel machines by introducing scenarios. A scenario is a subset of jobs, and the task of our problem is to find a global assignment of the jobs to machines so that the maximum makespan under a scenario, i.e., the maximum makespan of any schedule restricted to a scenario, is minimized.
  For varying values of the number of scenarios and machines, we explore the competitiveness of online algorithms. We prove tight and near-tight bounds, several of which are achieved through novel constructions. In particular, we leverage the interplay between the unit processing time case of our problem and the hypergraph coloring problem both ways: We use hypergraph coloring techniques to steer an adversarial family of instances proving lower bounds, which in turn leads to lower bounds for several variants of online hypergraph coloring.</description>

      <title>A Broader View on Clustering under Cluster-Aware Norm Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the $(f,g)$-clustering problem that we introduced in a recent work [SODA'25], and which subsumes fundamental clustering problems such as $k$-Center, $k$-Median, Min-Sum of Radii, and Min-Load $k$-Clustering. This problem assigns each of the $k$ clusters a cost determined by the monotone, symmetric norm $f$ applied to the vector distances in the cluster, and aims at minimizing the norm $g$ applied to the vector of cluster costs. Previously, we focused on certain special cases for which we designed constant-factor approximation algorithms. Our bounds for more general settings left, however, large gaps to the known bounds for the basic problems they capture.
  In this work, we provide a clearer picture of the approximability of these more general settings. First, we design an $O(\log^2 n)$-approximation algorithm for $(f, L_{1})$-clustering for any $f$. This improves upon our previous $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$-approximation. Second, we provide an $O(k)$-approximation for the general $(f,g)$-clustering problem, which improves upon our previous $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{kn})$-approximation algorithm and matches the best-known upper bound for Min-Load $k$-Clustering.
  We then design an approximation algorithm for $(f,g)$-clustering that interpolates, up to polylog factors, between the best known bounds for $k$-Center, $k$-Median, Min-Sum of Radii, Min-Load $k$-Clustering, (Top, $L_{1}$)-clustering, and $(L_{\infty},g)$-clustering based on a newly defined parameter of $f$ and $g$.</description>

      <title>Private Synthetic Data Generation in Bounded Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose $\mathtt{PrivHP}$, a lightweight synthetic data generator with \textit{differential privacy} guarantees. $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses a novel hierarchical decomposition that approximates the input's cumulative distribution function (CDF) in bounded memory. It balances hierarchy depth, noise addition, and pruning of low-frequency subdomains while preserving frequent ones. Private sketches estimate subdomain frequencies efficiently without full data access.
  A key feature is the pruning parameter $k$, which controls the trade-off between space and utility. We define the skew measure $\mathtt{tail}_k$, capturing all but the top $k$ subdomain frequencies. Given a dataset $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses $M=\mathcal{O}(k\log^2 |X|)$ space and, for input domain $\Omega = [0,1]$, ensures $\varepsilon$-differential privacy. It yields a generator with expected Wasserstein distance: \[ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log^2 M}{\varepsilon n} + \frac{||\mathtt{tail}_k(\mathcal{X})||_1}{M n}\right) \] from the empirical distribution. This parameterized trade-off offers a level of flexibility unavailable in prior work. We also provide interpretable utility bounds that account for hierarchy depth, privacy noise, pruning, and frequency estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Ryser--Brualdi--Stein conjecture asserts that every $k \times k$ Latin square contains a partial transversal of size $k-1$. Since its appearance, the conjecture has attracted significant interest, leading to several proposed generalizations. One of the most notable of these, by Aharoni, Kotlar, and Ziv, conjectures that $k$ disjoint common bases of two matroids of rank $k$ have a common independent partial transversal of size $k-1$. Although simple counterexamples show that the size $k-1$ above cannot be improved to $k$ (i.e., a transversal instead of a partial transversal), it is remarkable that no such counterexample is known for the special case of spanning arborescences. This motivated the formulation of the Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture: any graph on $n$ vertices formed by the union of $n-1$ spanning arborescences contains an arborescence using exactly one arc from each.
  We prove several partial results on this conjecture. We show that the computational problem of testing the existence of such an arborescence with a fixed root is NP-complete, verify the conjecture in several special cases, and study relaxations of the problem. In particular, we establish the validity of the conjecture when the underlying undirected graph is a cycle; this also yields a new result on systems of distinct representatives for intervals on a cycle.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via C-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. Informally, we say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $1/2$-local spectral expander. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top-link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for "sparse complexes" such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>

      <title>A Graph-based Approach to Variant Extraction from Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate variant descriptions are of paramount importance in the field of genomics. The domain is confronted with increasingly complex variants, e.g., combinations of multiple indels, making it challenging to generate proper variant descriptions directly from chromosomal sequences. We present a graph based on all minimal alignments that is a complete representation of a variant, which gives insight into the nature of a variant compared to a single variant description. We provide three complementary extraction methods to derive variant descriptions from this graph, including one that yields domain-specific constructs from the HGVS nomenclature. Our experiments show that our methods in comparison with dbSNP, the authoritative variant database from the NCBI, result in identical HGVS descriptions for simple variants and more meaningful descriptions for complex variants, in particular for repeat expansions and contractions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a multi-state spin system on a set $V$ of sites. Equivalently, we can think of this as a $d$-partite simplical complex with distribution $\mu$ on maximal faces. For any pair of vertices $u,v\in V$, define the pairwise spectral influence $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ as follows. Let $\sigma$ be a choice of spins $s_w\in S_w$ for every $w\in V \setminus \{u,v\}$, and construct a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{(S_u\cup S_v)\times (S_u\cup S_v)}$ where for any $s_u\in S_u, s_v\in S_v$, the $(us_u,vs_v)$-entry is the probability that $s_v$ is the spin of $v$ conditioned on $s_u$ being the spin of $u$ and on $\sigma$. Then $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximal second eigenvalue of this matrix, over all choices of spins for all $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximum local spectral expansion of links of codimension $2$ that include a spin for every $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$.
  We show that if the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise spectral influence matrix with entries $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is bounded away from 1, i.e. $\lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{I})\leq 1-\epsilon$ (and $X$ is connected), then the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly and generate samples from $\mu$. This improves/generalizes the classical Dobrushin's influence matrix as the $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ lower-bounds the classical influence of $u\to v$. As a by-product, we also prove improved/almost optimal trickle-down theorems for partite simplicial complexes. The proof builds on the trickle-down theorems via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials machinery recently developed by the authors and Lindberg.</description>
