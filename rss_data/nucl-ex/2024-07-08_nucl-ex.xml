      <title>Suppressed Electric Quadrupole Collectivity in $^{49}$Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-step Coulomb excitation of $^{46,48,49,50}$Ti is presented. A complete set of $E2$ matrix elements for the quintuplet of states in $^{49}$Ti, centered on the $2^+$ core excitation, was measured for the first time. A total of nine $E2$ matrix elements are reported, four of which were previously unknown. $^{49}_{22}$Ti$_{27}$ shows a $20\%$ quenching in electric quadrupole transition strength as compared to its semi-magic $^{50}_{22}$Ti$_{28}$ neighbour. This $20\%$ quenching, while empirically unprecedented, can be explained with a remarkably simple two-state mixing model, which is also consistent with other ground-state properties such as the magnetic dipole moment and electric quadrupole moment. A connection to nucleon transfer data and the quenching of single-particle strength is also demonstrated. The simplicity of the $^{49}$Ti-$^{50}$Ti pair (i.e., approximate single-$j$ $0f_{7/2}$ valence space and isolation of yrast states from non-yrast states) provides a unique opportunity to disentangle otherwise competing effects in the ground-state properties of atomic nuclei, the emergence of collectivity, and the role of proton-neutron interactions.</description>

      <title>On the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>Observation of ternary proton emission in heavy-ion induced fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton and $\alpha$-particle energy spectra were measured in coincidence with fission fragments in $^{16}$O (96 MeV) + $^{232}$Th reaction. The multiplicity spectra were analyzed within the framework of a Moving Source Disentangling Analysis (MSDA) to determine contributions from different emission stages. The MSDA conclusively shows "ternary proton emission" as an essential component in the proton multiplicity spectra akin to ternary $\alpha$ particles. It is the first time that "ternary proton emission" has been disentangled unambiguously from pre-scission emission in heavy-ion induced fission. Inverse trajectory calculations were performed, showing that experimentally observed Total Kinetic Energy (TKE) and kinetic energies of both ternary $\alpha$ particles and protons are well reproduced simultaneously by a common scission configuration. Thus, the scission stage parameters of a fissioning nucleus have been obtained, showing quantitatively that the scission configuration is significantly stretched in ternary- than the binary-fission.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of deeply bound orbitals in neutron-rich Ca isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calcium isotopes are an ideal system to investigate the evolution of shell structure and magic numbers. Although the properties of surface nucleons in calcium have been well studied, probing the structure of deeply bound nucleons remains a challenge. Here, we report on the first measurement of unbound states in $^{53}$Ca and $^{55}$Ca, populated from \ts{54,56}Ca($p,pn$) reactions at a beam energy of around 216 MeV/nucleon at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotopes Beam Factory. The resonance properties, partial cross sections, and momentum distributions of these unbound states were analyzed. Orbital angular momentum $l$ assignments were extracted from momentum distributions based on calculations using the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA) reaction model. The resonances at excitation energies of 5516(41)\,keV in $^{53}$Ca and 6000(250)\,keV in $^{55}$Ca indicate a significant $l$\, =\,3 component, providing the first experimental evidence for the $\nu 0f_{7/2}$ single-particle strength of unbound hole states in the neutron-rich Ca isotopes. The observed excitation energies and cross-sections point towards extremely localized and well separated strength distributions, with some fragmentation for the $\nu 0f_{7/2}$ orbital in $^{55}$Ca. These results are in good agreement with predictions from shell-model calculations using the effective GXPF1Bs interaction and \textit{ab initio} calculations and diverge markedly from the experimental distributions in the nickel isotones at $Z=28$.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS on the pion in Sullivan processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Iterative Deblurring: No Explicit Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative deblurring, notably the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with and without regularization, is analyzed in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics applications. In these applications, probability distributions may be discretized into a few bins, measurement statistics can be high, and instrument performance can be well understood. In such circumstances, it is essential to understand the deblurring first without any explicit noise considerations. We employ singular value decomposition for the blurring matrix in a low-count pixel system. A strong blurring may yield a null space for the blurring matrix. Yet, a nonnegativity constraint for images built into the deblurring may help restore null-space content in a high-contrast image with zero or low intensity for a sufficient number of pixels. For low-contrast images, the control over null-space content may be gained through regularization. When the regularization is applied, the blurred image is, in practice, restored to an image that is still blurred but less than the starting one.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

      <title>On the existence of a proton halo in $^{22}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More and more halo nuclei or candidates have been identified or suggested in experiments in recent years. It was declared that the halo structure of $^{22}$Al is revealed by the large isospin asymmetry in $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O mirror Gamow-Teller transitions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 192503 (2020)]. We highlight that a significant mirror asymmetry already exists between wave functions of the likely unbound nucleus $^{22}$Si and the doubly-magic nucleus $^{22}$O, which largely explains the observed asymmetry in the transitions. Furthermore, these transitions involve only the $1^+$ excited states of the daughter nuclei $^{22}$Al and $^{22}$F. The $1^+$ state of $^{22}$Al cannot be considered a halo state due to its proton-unbound nature. An analysis of the spin-parity suggests that a weakly bound $2s_{1/2}$ valence proton in the ground-state $^{22}$Al is improbable. To investigate the shell structure for the ground state of $^{22}$Al, we employ the state-of-the-art deformed and triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theories in continuum. We find that a small $s$-wave component of $5\%$ appears for the weakly bound valence proton in $^{22}$Al only when triaxial deformation is considered. While the examination of densities and rms radii indicates that this small $s$-wave component is insufficient to form a discernible proton halo in $^{22}$Al, slightly larger $2s_{1/2}$ occupations have been reported in other recent theoretical results. The question of how many low-$\ell$ components are sufficient to form a proton halo in the presence of the Coulomb barrier remains open. Thus, future measurements of reaction or interaction cross sections and momentum distributions of breakup fragments are highly desirable to verify whether $^{22}$Al is a halo nucleus.</description>

      <title>Role of clustered nuclear geometry in particle production through p-C and p-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range multi-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions have shown conclusive evidence of the hydrodynamic behavior of strongly interacting matter, and are associated with the final-state azimuthal momentum anisotropy. In small collision systems, azimuthal anisotropy can be influenced by the hadronization mechanism and residual jet-like correlations. Thus, one of the motives of the planned p--O and O--O collisions at the LHC and RHIC is to understand the origin of small system collectivity. As the anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) are sensitive to the initial-state effects including nuclear shape, deformation, and charge density profiles, studies involving $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei are transpiring due to the presence of exotic $\alpha$ ($^{4}$He) clusters in such nuclei. In this study, for the first time, we investigate the effects of nuclear $\alpha$--clusters on the azimuthal anisotropy of the final-state hadrons in p--C and p--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 9.9$ TeV within a multi-phase transport model framework. We report the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) spectra, participant eccentricity ($\epsilon_2$) and triangularity ($\epsilon_3$), and estimate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) of the final-state hadrons using the two-particle cumulant method. These results are compared with a model-independent Sum of Gaussians (SOG) type nuclear density profile for $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic study of intermediate invariant mass dilepton production in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is performed, using next-to-leading-order (NLO) thermal QCD dilepton emission rates with a multistage dynamical approach which includes event-by-event IP-Glasma initial conditions, relativistic viscous fluid dynamics, and a hadronic afterburner. Considering dilepton yield and anisotropic flow, special attention is paid to the out-of-equilibrium aspects, both thermal and chemical, and to the contribution of the Drell-Yan process. The relative contribution of each of those different channels to dilepton observables is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a DC acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state RF amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.</description>

Abstract: In the previous work, we discussed the cross section and the detection of 4.4-MeV $\gamma$ rays produced in the neutrino neutral-current (NC) reaction $^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$) in a water Cherenkov detector at the low energy below 100 MeV. In this report, we further investigated both the charged-current (CC) reaction $^{16}$O($\bar\nu_e, e^+$)$^{16}$N(0 MeV, $2^-$) and the NC reaction$^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$), producing high-energy $\gamma$ rays, in which the more solid identification of the reactions can be applied via the coincidence method.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to charged hadrons with high-precision data from the LHC</title>

Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are essential non-perturbative QCD inputs for predicting hadron production cross sections in high energy scatterings. In this study, we present a joint determination of FFs for light charged hadrons through a global analysis at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. Our analysis incorporates a wide range of precision measurements from the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. By including measurements of jet fragmentation at the LHC in our global analysis, we are able to impose strong constraints on the gluon FFs. A careful selection of hadron kinematics is applied to ensure the validity of factorization and perturbative calculations of QCD. In addition, we introduce several methodological advances in fitting, resulting in a flexible parametrization form and the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties from perturbative calculations. Our best-fit predictions show very good agreement with the global data, with $\chi^2/N_{pt}\sim 0.90$. We also generate a large number of Hessian error sets to estimate uncertainties and correlations of the extracted FFs. FFs to charged pions (kaons and protons) are well constrained for momentum fractions down to 0.01 (0.1). Total momentum of partons carried by light charged hadrons are determined precisely. Their values for $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon saturate at about 50\% for a lower cut of the momentum fraction of 0.01. Pulls from individual datasets and impact of various choices of the analysis are also studied in details. Additionally, we present an update of the FMNLO program used for calculating hadron production cross sections. Our FFs, including the error sets (denoted as NPC23), are publicly available in the form of LHAPDF6 grids.</description>

      <title>Towards observation of three-nucleon short-range correlations in high Q^2 A(e, e')X reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.07629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of kinematical and dynamical conditions necessary for probing highly elusive three-nucleon short range correlations~(3N-SRCs) in nuclei through inclusive electron scattering. The kinematic requirements that should be satisfied in order to isolate 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes are derived. We demonstrate that a sequence of two short-range NN interactions represents the main mechanism for 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes. Within this mechanism we predict a quadratic dependence of the inclusive cross section ratios of nuclei to $^3$He in the 3N-SRC region to the same ratio measured in 2N-SRC domain. The extended analysis of the available data satisfying the necessary 3N-SRC kinematical conditions is presented. This analysis provides tantalizing signatures of scaling associated with the onset of 3N-SRC dominance. The same data are also consistent with the prediction of the quadratic relation between the ratios measured in the 3N and 2N-SRC regions for nuclei ranging $4 \le A \le 197$. This agreement made it possible to extract $a_3(A)$, the probability of 3N-SRCs relative to the A=3 nucleus. We find $a_3(A)$ to be significantly larger in magnitude than the analogous parameter, $a_2(A)$, for 2N-SRCs.</description>

      <title>Exciting Ions: a Systematic Treatment of Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions with Nuclear Breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated theoretical treatment of ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions, within the SuperChic Monte Carlo generator. This in particular accounts for mutual ion excitation through additional photon exchanges between the colliding ions. This effect occurs frequently in UPCs, and indeed can be (and has been) measured in data through the use of zero degree calorimeter (ZDC) detectors installed in the far forward region. The theoretical approach presented here accounts for the non-trivial and non-negligible impact such ion dissociation has on the measured cross sections and distributions of the produced particles in the central detectors. This builds on previous work, whereby the survival factor probability of no additional inelastic ion-ion scattering due to the strong interaction, and its kinematic impact, are also accounted for within the same overall framework. We compare to data from ATLAS and CMS at the LHC, and STAR at RHIC, and find in general encouraging agreement for a range of observables and ZDC neutron tags, with some room for further improvement, suggesting the inclusion of higher order QED effects and/or tuning of the the $\gamma A \to A^*$ cross section may be desirable. Overall, this gives confidence in the approach considered here and for applications to new phenomena within and beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial fluctuations and nuclear deformations in isobar collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic isobar ($^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr) collisions have revealed intricate differences in their nuclear size and shape, inspiring unconventional studies of nuclear structure using relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the relative differences in the mean multiplicity ($R_{\langle N_{\rm ch}\rangle}$) and the second- ($R_{\epsilon_{2}}$) and third-order eccentricity ($R_{\epsilon_{3}}$) between isobar collisions using initial state models. It is found that initial fluctuations and nuclear deformations have negligible effects on $R_{\langle N_{\rm ch}\rangle}$ in most central collisions, while both are important for the $R_{\epsilon_{2}}$ and $R_{\epsilon_{3}}$, the degree of which is sensitive to the underlying nucleonic or sub-nucleonic degree of freedom. These features, compared to real data, may probe the particle production mechanism and the physics underlying nuclear structure.</description>
