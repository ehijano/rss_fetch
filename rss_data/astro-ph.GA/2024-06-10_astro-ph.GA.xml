      <title>The Star-Forming Main Sequence in JADES and CEERS at $z&gt;1.4$: Investigating the Burstiness of Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used public JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam observations from the CEERS and JADES surveys in order to analyze the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) over the redshift range $1.4 \leq z &lt; 7$. We calculate the star-formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxy sample using three approaches: Balmer line luminosity, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and UV luminosity. We find a larger degree of scatter about the SFMS using the Balmer-based SFRs compared to the UV-based SFRs. Because these SFR indicators are sensitive to star formation on different time scales, the difference in scatter may be evidence of bursty star-formation histories in the early universe. We additionally compare the H$\alpha$-to-UV luminosity ratio (L(H$\alpha$)/$\nu$L$_{\nu,1600}$) for individual galaxies in the sample and find that 29\%$-$52\% of the ratios across the sample are poorly described by predictions from a smooth star-formation history. Measuring the burstiness of star formation in the early universe has multiple significant implications, such as deriving accurate physical parameters from SED fitting, explaining the evolution of the UV luminosity function, and providing constraints for sub-grid models of feedback in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterization of detached tidal dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interactions between galaxies often give rise to tidal tails, which can harbor concentrations of stars and interstellar gas resembling dwarf galaxies. Some of these tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) have the potential to detach from their parent galaxies and become independent entities, but their long-term survival is uncertain. In this study, we conducted a search for detached TDGs associated with a sample of 39 interacting galaxy pairs in the local Universe using infrared, ultraviolet, and optical images. We employed IR colors and UV/optical/IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to identify potential interlopers such as foreground stars or background quasars. Through spectroscopic observations using the Boller &amp; Chivens spectrograph at San Pedro M\'artir Observatory, we confirmed that six candidate TDGs are at the same redshift as their putative parent galaxy pairs. We identified and measured emission lines in the optical spectra and calculated nebular oxygen abundances, which range from log(O/H) = 8.10 $\pm$ 0.01 to 8.51 $\pm$ 0.02. We have serendipitously discovered an additional detached TDG candidate in Arp72 using available spectra from SDSS. Utilizing the photometric data and the CIGALE code for stellar population and dust emission fitting, we derived stellar masses, stellar population ages, and stellar metallicities for these detached TDGs. Compared to standard mass-metallicity relations for dwarf galaxies, five of the seven candidates have higher than expected metallicities, confirming their tidal origins, one of the seven remains unclear due to large uncertainties in metallicity, and another has stellar and nebular metallicities compatible with those of a pre-existing dwarf galaxy. The latter object is relatively compact in the optical relative to its stellar mass, in contrast to the other candidate TDGs [abridged].</description>

      <title>Revealing faint compact radio jets at redshifts above 5 with very long baseline interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, our knowledge of the high-redshift (z &gt; 5) radio quasars has expanded, thanks to dedicated high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. Distant quasars provide unique information about the formation and evolution of the first galaxies and supermassive black holes in the Universe. Powerful relativistic jets are likely to have played an essential role in these processes. However, the sample of VLBI-observed radio quasars is still too small to allow meaningful statistical conclusions. We extend the list of the VLBI observed radio quasars to investigate how the source structure and physical parameters are related to radio loudness. We assembled a sample of 10 faint radio quasars located at 5 &lt; z &lt; 6 with their radio-loudness indices spanning between 0.9-76. We observed the selected targets with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 GHz. The milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI at this frequency allows us to probe the compact innermost parts of radio-emitting relativistic jets. In addition to the single-band VLBI observations, we collected single-dish and low-resolution radio interferometric data to investigate the spectral properties and variability of our sources. The detection rate of this high-redshift, low-flux-density sample is 90%, with only one target (J0306+1853) remaining undetected. The other 9 sources appear core-dominated and show a single, faint and compact radio core on this angular scale. The derived radio powers are typical of FRII radio galaxies and quasars. By extending our sample with other VLBI-detected z &gt; 5 sources from the literature, we found that the core brightness temperatures and monochromatic radio powers tend to increase with radio loudness.</description>

      <title>Detection of New Galaxy Candidates at $z\ &gt;$ 11 in the JADES Field Using JWST NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of seven new galaxy candidates with redshift $z$ $&gt;$ 11 within the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. These new candidates are detected through meticulous analysis of NIRCam photometry in eight filters spanning a wavelength range of 0.8-5.0 $\mu$m. Photometric redshifts of these galaxy candidates are independently measured utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques using \texttt{EAZY} and \texttt{BAGPIPES} codes, followed by visual scrutiny. Two of these galaxy candidates are located in GOODS-S field, while the remaining five galaxies are located in GOODS-N field. Our analysis reveals that the stellar masses of these galaxies typically range from log $M_{\ast}$/$M_{\odot}$ = 7.75--8.75. Futhermore, these galaxies are typically young with their mass-weighted ages spanning from 80 to 240 Myr. Their specific star formation rates (sSFR), quantified as $\log (\text{sSFR}/\text{Gyr}$), are measured to vary between $\sim 0.95$ to 1.46. These new galaxy candidates offer a robust sample for probing the physical properties of galaxies within the first few hundred Myr of the history of the Universe. We also analyze the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_\ast$) within our sample. Using linear regression, our analysis yields a slope of $0.71 \pm 0.12$, which we then compare with results from previous studies. Continued investigation through spectroscopic analysis using JWST/NIRSpec is needed to spectroscopically confirm these high-redshift galaxy candidates and investigate further into their physical properties. We plan to follow up on these candidates with future NIRSpec observations.</description>

      <title>MARTINI: Mock Array Radio Telescope Interferometry of the Neutral ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MARTINI is a modular Python package that takes smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of galaxies as input and creates synthetic spatially- and/or spectrally-resolved observations of the 21-cm radio emission line of atomic hydrogen (data cubes). The various aspects of the mock-observing process are divided logically into sub-modules handling the data cube, source galaxy, telescope beam pattern, noise, spectral model and SPH kernel. MARTINI is object-oriented: each sub-module provides a class (or classes) which can be configured as desired. For most sub-modules, base classes are provided to allow for straightforward customization. Instances of each sub-module class are given as parameters to an instance of a main "Martini" class; a mock observation is then constructed by calling a handful of functions to execute the desired steps in the mock-observing process.</description>

      <title>The size of the Milky Way galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size of a galaxy is one of the fundamental parameters that reflects its growth and assembly history. Traditionally, the size of the Milky Way has been characterized by the scale length of the disk, based on the assumption of an exponential density profile. Earlier scale length measurements suggest the Milky Way is an overly compact galaxy, compared to similar galaxies of its mass. These size measurements, however, ignore the presence of the bulge, and the assumption of a single-exponential disk profile faces growing challenges from the recent observations. The half-light radius is an alternative size measurement that is independent of the galaxy density profile and has been widely used to quantify the size of external galaxies. Here we report the half-light radius of the Milky Way, derived from a new measurement of the age-resolved Galactic surface brightness profile in an unprecedentedly wide radial range from ${\rm R=0}$ to 17~kpc. We find a broken surface brightness profile with a nearly flat distribution between 3.5 and 7.5 kpc, which results in a half-light radius of 5.75$\pm$0.38 kpc, significantly larger than the scale-length inferred from the canonical single-exponential disk profile but in good consistency with local disk galaxies of similar mass. Because our density profile can be decomposed by stellar age and extrapolated backwards in time, we can also confirm that the size history of the Milky Way is broadly consistent with high-redshift galaxies but with systematically smaller size at each look back time. Our results suggest that the Milky Way is a typical disk galaxy regarding its size and has likely experienced inefficient secular size growth.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimension of star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of the structure of star clusters is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. In this article, we explore the application of fractal dimension analysis to study the evolution of star clusters. Fractal dimension, a concept from fractal geometry, provides a quantitative measure of the complexity and self-similarity of geometric objects. By considering star clusters as complex networks, we employ the box covering method to calculate their fractal dimension. Our methodology combines the well-established Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Box-Covering (BC) methods. Using these methods, the fractal structure of the clusters was determined. It was revealed that star clusters disintegrate at a fractal dimension of 1.3 and obey a power law. It should be noted that the obtained result was compared with the results of the McLuster.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey XXV: The Galactic underdogs -- Dynamic tales of a Milky Way metal-poor population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the chemodynamical characterisation of metal-poor stars, one can efficiently probe the early history of the Milky Way. We aim at decontaminating a sample of $\sim$ 3M giant stars with Gaia DR3 XP-based \textit{Pristine-Gaia} metallicities, to investigate a subset of very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt; -1.7) with disc-like orbits. We construct a statistically robust sample of $\sim$ 36 000 very metal-poor giants, using APOGEE and LAMOST to estimate and remove contamination from high $V_\phi$ stars. We investigate the spatial and kinematic properties of the decontaminated sample, using $V_\phi$ and the action space, both powerful to disentangle stellar populations. As in previous works, we find a pronounced asymmetry in $L_z$ and $V_\phi$ in favour of prograde stars. This excess is mostly made of prograde-planar stars (10% of the very metal-poor population), and contains stars with $V_\phi$ &gt; 180 km s$^{-1}$ and $Z_{\text{max}}$ &lt; 1.5 kpc, down to [Fe/H] = -2.9 at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level. While the overall orbital distributions of our sample match that of a halo, the highly prograde and planar subset (2% of the very metal-poor population) also bears characteristics classically associated with a thick disc, i.e., a spatial distribution compatible with a short-scaled thick disc, and a thick disc-like $Z_{\text{max}}$ - $R_{\text{max}}$ distribution. Additionally, assuming a stationary or prograde halo with $\overline{V_\phi}$ $\sim$ 30-40 km.s$^{-1}$ is not sufficient to suppress the kinematic signature of the highly prograde and planar subset. These results rule out any link with a thin disc, and instead, support a contribution from a \textit{metal-weak thick disc}.</description>

      <title>Identification of Intermediate-mass Black Hole Candidates Among a Sample of Sd Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed images of every northern hemisphere Sd galaxy listed in the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3) with a relatively face-on inclination ($\theta\leq30{\deg}$). Specifically, we measured the spiral arms' winding angle, $\phi$, in 85 galaxies. We applied a novel black hole mass planar scaling relation involving the rotational velocities (from the literature) and pitch angles of each galaxy to predict central black hole masses. This yielded 23 galaxies, each having at least a 50% chance of hosting a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), $10^2&lt;M_\mathrm{BH}\leq10^5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. These 23 nearby ($\lesssim$50 Mpc) targets may be suitable for an array of follow-up observations to check for active nuclei. Based on our full sample of 85 Sd galaxies, we estimate that the typical Sd galaxy (which tends to be bulgeless) harbors a black hole with $\log(M_\mathrm{BH}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=6.00\pm0.14$, but with a 27.7% chance of hosting an IMBH, making this morphological type of galaxy fertile ground for hunting elusive IMBHs. Thus, we find that a $\sim$$10^6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ black hole corresponds roughly to the onset of bulge development and serves as a conspicuous waypoint along the galaxy-SMBH coevolution journey. Our survey suggests that $&gt;$1.22% of bright galaxies ($B_{\rm T}\lesssim15.5$ mag) in the local Universe host an IMBH (i.e., the "occupation fraction"), which implies a number density $&gt;$$4.96\times10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ for central IMBHs. Finally, we observe that Sd galaxies exhibit an unexpected diversity of properties that resemble the general population of spiral galaxies, albeit with an enhanced signature of the eponymous prototypical traits (i.e., low masses, loosely wound spiral arms, and smaller rotational velocities).</description>

      <title>Deep Search for Phosphine in a Prestellar Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding in which chemical forms phosphorus exists in star- and planet-forming regions and how phosphorus is delivered to planets are of great interest from the viewpoint of the origin of life on Earth. Phosphine (PH3) is thought to be a key species to understanding phosphorus chemistry, but never has been detected in star- and planet-forming regions. We performed sensitive observations of the ortho-PH3 $1_0-0_0$ transition (266.944 GHz) toward the low-mass prestellar core L1544 with the ACA stand-alone mode of ALMA. The line was not detected down to 3$\sigma$ levels in 0.07 km s$^{-1}$ channels of 18 mK. The non-detection provides the upper limit to the gas-phase PH3 abundance of $5\times10^{-12}$ with respect to H2 in the central part of the core. Based on the gas-ice astrochemical modeling, we find the scaling relationship between the gas-phase PH3 abundance and the volatile (gas and ice with larger volatility than water) P elemental abundance for given physical conditions. This characteristic and well-constrained physical properties of L1544 allow us to constrain the upper limit to the volatile P elemental abundance of $5\times10^{-9}$, which is a factor of 60 lower than the overall P abundance in the ISM. Then the majority of P should exist in refractory forms. The volatile P elemental abundance of L1544 is smaller than that in the coma of comet 67P/C-G, implying that the conversion of refractory phosphorus to volatile phosphorus could have occurred along the trail from the presolar core to the protosolar disk through e.g., sputtering by accretion/outflow shocks.</description>

      <title>Faraday moments of the Southern Twenty-centimeter All-sky Polarization Survey (STAPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faraday tomography of broadband radio polarization surveys enables us to study magnetic fields and their interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). Such surveys include the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS), which covers the northern and southern hemispheres at $\sim$ 300-1800 MHz.
  In this work, we used the GMIMS High Band South (1328-1768 MHz), also named the Southern Twenty-centimeter All-sky Polarization Survey (STAPS), which observes the southern sky at a resolution of 18$\arcmin$.
  To extract the key parameters of the magnetized ISM from STAPS, we computed the Faraday moments of the tomographic data cubes. These moments include the total polarized intensity, the mean Faraday depth weighted by the polarized intensity, the weighted dispersion of the Faraday spectrum, and its skewness. We compared the Faraday moments to those calculated over the same frequency range in the northern sky (using the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, DRAO), in a strip of $360\degr \times 30\degr$ that overlaps with STAPS coverage.
  We find that the total polarized intensity is generally dominated by diffuse emission that decreases at longitudes of $l \leq 300\degr$. The Faraday moments reveal a variety of polarization structures. Low-intensity regions at high latitudes usually have a single Faraday depth component. Due to its insufficiently large frequency coverage, STAPS cannot detect Faraday thick structures. Comparing the Faraday depths from STAPS to total rotation measures from extragalactic sources suggests that STAPS frequencies are high enough that the intervening ISM causes depolarization to background emission at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes. Where they overlap, the STAPS and DRAO surveys exhibit broad correspondence but differ in polarized intensity by a factor of $\sim$1.8.</description>

      <title>QUIJOTE discovery of the cation radicals HC5N+ and HC7N+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery with the QUIJOTE line survey of the cations HC5N+ and HC7N+ in the direction of TMC-1. Seven lines with half-integer quantum numbers from J=25/2-23/2 to 37/2-35/2 have been assigned to HC5N+ and eight lines from J=55/2-53/2 to 71/2-69/2 to HC7N+. Both species have inverted 2Pi ground electronic states with very good estimates for their B0 and AS0 constants based on optical observations. The lines with the lowest J of HC5N+ exhibit multiple components due to the hyperfine structure introduced by the H and N nuclei. However, these different components collapse for the higher J. No hyperfine structure is found for any of the lines of HC7N+. The derived effective rotational and distortion constants for HC5N+ are Beff = 1336.662+/- 0.001 MHz and Deff = 27.4+/-2.6 Hz, while for HC7N+ they are Beff = 567.85036+/-0.00037 MHz and Deff = 4.01+/-0.19 Hz. From the observed intensities, we derived Trot = 5.5+/-0.5K and N = (9.9+/-1.0)x 1010 cm-2 for HC5N+, while we obtained Trot = 8.5+/-0.5K and N = (2.3+/-0.2)x1010 cm-2 for HC7N+. The HC5N/HC5N+, C5N/HC5N+, C5N-/HC5N+, HC7N/HC7N+, HC5N+/HC7N+, and C7N-/HC7N+ abundance ratios are 670+/-80, 4.8+/-0.8, 1.2+/-0.2, 1000+/-150, 4.2+/-0.5, and 2.2+/-0.2, respectively. We have run chemical modelling calculations to investigate the formation and destruction of these new cations. We find that these species are mainly formed through the reactions of H2 and the cations C5N+ and C7N+, and by the reactions of H+ with HC5N and HC7N, while they are mostly destroyed through a reaction with H2 and a dissociative recombination with electrons. Based on the underestimation of the abundances of HC5N+ and HC7N+ by the chemical model by a factor around 20, we suggest that the rate coefficients currently assumed for the reactions of these cations with H2 could be too high by the same factor, something that will be worth investigating.</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight is counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the observed age vs. Galactocentric radius distribution in the Milky Way is a direct consequence of the disc's negative radial metallicity gradient (and, depending on the set of stellar models used, a metallicity dependence of the instability strip). The interplay of the metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unlikely. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>

      <title>The 2024 release of the ExoMol database: molecular line lists for exoplanet and other hot atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ExoMol database (www.exomol.com) provides molecular data for spectroscopic studies of hot atmospheres. These data are widely used to model atmospheres of exoplanets, cool stars and other astronomical objects, as well as a variety of terrestrial applications. The 2024 data release reports the current status of the database which contains recommended line lists for 91 molecules and 224 isotopologues giving a total of almost 10$^{12}$ individual transitions. New features of the database include extensive "MARVELization" of line lists to allow them to be used for high resolutions studies, extension of several line lists to ultraviolet wavelengths, provision of photodissociation cross sections and extended provision of broadening parameters. Some of the in-house data specifications have been rewritten in JSON and moved to conformity with other international standards. Data products, including specific heats, a database of lifetimes for plasma studies, and the ExoMolHR web app which allows exclusively high resolution data to be extracted, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Most nearby young star clusters formed in three massive complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to unveil the structure of the local interstellar medium and its recent star formation history have spanned the past seventy years. Recent studies utilizing precise data from space astrometry missions have revealed nearby, newly formed star clusters with connected origins. Nonetheless, mapping young clusters across the entire sky back to their natal regions has been hindered by a lack of clusters with precise radial velocity data. Here we show that 155 out of 272 (57 percent) high-quality young clusters within one kiloparsec of the Sun arise from three distinct spatial volumes. This conclusion is based upon the analysis of data from the third Gaia release and other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Currently dispersed throughout the Solar Neighborhood, their past positions over 30 Myr ago reveal that these families of clusters each formed in one of three compact, massive star-forming complexes. One of these families includes all of the young clusters near the Sun -- the Taurus and Sco-Cen star-forming complexes. We estimate that over 200 supernovae were produced from these families and argue that these clustered supernovae produced both the Local Bubble and the largest nearby supershell GSH 238+00+09, both of which are clearly visible in modern three-dimensional dust maps.</description>

      <title>On the Interpretation of Mid-Infrared Absorption Lines of Gas-Phase H$_2$O as Observed by JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ro-vibrational absorption lines of H$_2$O in the 5-8 $\mu$m wavelength range selectively probe gas against the mid-infrared continuum emitting background of the inner regions of YSOs and AGN and deliver important information about these warm, dust-obscured environments. JWST/MIRI detects these lines in many lines of sight at a moderate spectral resolving power of $R\sim3500$ (FWHM of 85 km/s). Based on our analysis of high-resolution SOFIA/EXES observations, we find that the interpretation of JWST/MIRI absorption spectra can be severely hampered by the blending of individual transitions and the lost information on the intrinsic line width or the partial coverage of the background continuum source. In this paper, we point out problems such as degeneracy that arise in deriving physical properties from an insufficiently resolved spectrum. This can lead to differences in the column density by two orders of magnitude. We emphasize the importance of weighting optically thin and weak lines in spectral analyses and provide recipes for breaking down the coupled parameters. We also provide an online tool to generate the H$_2$O absorption line spectra that can be compared to observations.</description>

      <title>Instrumental Broadening Of The SPOL Spectropolarimeter At The University Of Arizona</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ground-based Observational Support of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is conducted by the University of Arizona using the 2.3m Bok and 1.54m Kuiper telescopes operated by the Steward Observatory (SO). This program monitors blazar sources with spectroscopic (among others) observations. Yet, the instrumental broadenings for the different slit widths used in the spectra, are unavailable (the widths range from 2.0 to 12.7 arcsec). Using quasi-simultaneous spectroscopic observations of the blazar 3C 273 between the SO, Observatorio Astrof\'isico Guillermo Haro (OAGH), and Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional San Pedro M\'artir (OAN-SPM), we can provide an estimation of the instrumental profile for two of the slit widths. Since the instrumental broadening and the slit width are directly proportional, we were able to estimate the instrumental broadening for all six slit widths used at the SO. We found significant variations between the instrumental profiles, emphasizing the need to correct the instrumental broadening for each aperture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological coupling of spherical, local astrophysical systems. We derive a general formula quantifying the cosmological coupling of the Misner-Sharp mass of these objects. We show that, in the weak-field limit, the cosmological coupling is only allowed if there are pressure anisotropies. We also apply our results to galaxies, modelling them with the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles. We show that the galactic mass can be coupled to the cosmological dynamics and examine its dependence on the scale factor of the universe.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Evidence of Changing Dust Distributions With Redshift Using Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernova (SNIa) are excellent probes of local distance, and the increasing sample sizes of SNIa have driven an increased need to study the associated systematic uncertainties and improve the standardisation methods in preparation for the next generation of cosmological surveys into the dark energy equation-of-state $w$. We aim to probe the potential change in the SNIa standardisation parameter $c$ with redshift and the host-galaxy of the supernova. Improving the standardisation of SNIa brightnesses will require accounting for the relationship between the host and the SNIa, and potential shifts in the SNIa standardisation parameters with redshift will cause biases in the recovered cosmology. Here, we assemble a volume-limited sample of ~3000 likely SNIa across a redshift range of $z = 0.015$ to $z = 0.36$. This sample is fitted with changing mass and redshift bins to determine the relationship between intrinsic properties of SNe Ia and their redshift and host galaxy parameters. We then investigate the colour-luminosity parameter $\beta$ as a further test of the SNIa standardisation process. We find that the changing colour distribution of SNe Ia with redshift is driven by dust at a confidence of $&gt;4\sigma$. Additionally, we show a strong correlation between the host galaxy mass and the colour-luminosity coefficient $\beta$ ($&gt; 4\sigma$), even when accounting for the quantity of dust in a host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Galaxy lens reconstruction based on strongly lensed gravitational waves: similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) galaxy lens reconstruction is a crucial step for many GW lensing science applications. However, dark siren GW lensing (i.e. lensed GW without observed electromagnetic (EM) counterpart) suffers from similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy. We review these two degeneracies and discuss their implications on GW-based lens reconstruction and two well-known GW lensing science cases: the Hubble constant measurement and test for modified GW propagation. Building upon previous works, our conclusions are:1) GWs can only infer the scale-free lens mass model parameters, the dimensionless source position, the GW luminosity distance and the time delay scaling (a combination of Einstein radius, lens redshift, and cosmology).2) Lens reconstruction (of singular isothermal ellipsoid lens) with only two GW signals is unlikely to yield a complete lens model, while four (three) signals can measure all the above parameters accurately (with large uncertainties).3) The similarity transformation degeneracy causes the lens redshift/Einstein radius/cosmology to be degenerate in dark siren measurements. Breaking the degeneracy can be achieved by supplementing the GWs with EM observation of lens redshifts/Einstein radius (source redshift is not required).4) The mass-sheet degeneracy causes the GW luminosity distance to be entirely degenerate with a constant mass sheet.5) Contrary to expectation, the Hubble constant is degenerate with the mass-sheet even when supplemented with lens reconstruction/redshift/Einstein radius and can only be lifted with lens galaxy velocity dispersion measurement, while modified GW propagation test discussed in prior literature is unaffected by the degeneracy. These properties highlight the need for GW observations to be supplemented by EM observations, which could become accessible through a lens archival search or a rapid EM follow-up.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the massive-seed pathway to high-redshift black holes: statistics of the evolving black hole to host galaxy mass ratio</title>

Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses of $\sim 10^9 {\rm M_\odot}$ within the first billion year of the universe challenge our conventional understanding of black hole formation and growth. One pathway to these SMBHs proposes that supermassive stars (SMSs) born in pristine atomic cooling haloes (ACHs) yield massive seed BHs evolving to these early SMBHs. This scenario leads to an overly massive BH galaxy (OMBG), in which the BH to stellar mass ratio is initially $M_{\rm bh}/M_* \geq 1$, well in excess of the typical values of $\sim 10^{-3}$ at low redshifts. Previously, we have investigated two massive seed BH candidates from the \texttt{Renaissance} simulation and found that they remain outliers on the $M_{\rm bh}-M_{*}$ relation until the OMBG merges with a much more massive halo at $z{=}8$. In this work, we use Monte-Carlo merger trees to investigate the evolution of the $M_{\rm bh}-M_{*}$ relation for $50,000$ protogalaxies hosting massive BH seeds, across $10,000$ trees that merge into a $10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ halo at $z{=}6$. We find that up to $60\%$ (depending on growth parameters) of these OMBGs remain strong outliers for several 100 Myr, down to redshifts detectable with {\it JWST} and with sensitive X-ray telescopes. This represents a way to diagnose the massive-seed formation pathway for early SMBHs. We expect to find ${\sim} 0.1{-}1$ of these objects per {\it JWST} NIRCam field per unit redshift at $z\gtrsim 6$. Recently detected SMBHs with masses of $\sim 10^7~{\rm M_\odot}$ and low inferred stellar-mass hosts may be examples of this population.</description>

      <title>Prospects for constraining quasar ages with fiber spectrographs: quasar-induced Ly$\alpha$ emission from the intergalactic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for linking quasar properties, such as quasar age, to the surrounding Ly$\alpha$ emission intensity. In particular, we focus on a method for mapping the large-scale structure of Ly$\alpha$ emission intensity with galaxy spectra from wide-field spectroscopic surveys, e.g., the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) or the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and consider the quasar-induced Ly$\alpha$ emission from the intergalactic medium (IGM). To do this, we construct a theoretical model based on two physical processes: resonant scattering of quasar Ly$\alpha$ photons and fluorescence due to quasar ionizing photons, finding that the fluorescence contribution due to optically thick gas clouds is dominant. Taking into account the light cone effect and assuming a typical quasar spectrum, we calculate the fluorescence contribution to the spectrum stacked within each bin of the separation angle from the quasar as a function of quasar age. Furthermore, we compute the quasar-Ly$\alpha$ emission cross-correlation and its SNR for the planned PFS survey. The predicted signal can only account for $\sim10\%$ of the measurements indicated from the BOSS and eBOSS surveys in the outer region of $&gt; 10\ \rm{cMpc}\ \rm{h}^{-1}$, and the predicted SNR is not sufficient to detect the quasar-induced contribution. However, we found that our model, combined with the contribution of star-forming galaxies, is not in conflict with these measurements. We discuss other possible contributions to the Ly$\alpha$ emission excess around quasars, the efficiency of using spectroscopic fibers, and the redshift dependence of our model.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Mystery of the Low CO-to-H$_2$ Conversion Factor in Starburst Galaxies: RADEX Modeling of the Antennae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CO emission has been widely used as a tracer of molecular gas mass. However, it is a long-standing issue to accurately constrain the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$) that converts CO luminosity to molecular gas mass, especially in starburst galaxies. We present the first resolved $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ modeling results with multiple ALMA CO and $^{13}$CO transition observations at both giant molecular cloud (GMC) scale at 150 pc and kpc scale for one of the closest starburst mergers, the Antennae. By combining our CO modeling results and measurements of 350 GHz dust continuum, we find that most GMCs in the Antennae have $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ values $\sim$4 times smaller than the commonly adopted Milky Way value (4.3). We find $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ at GMC scales shows a strong dependence on CO intensity, $^{13}$CO/CO ratio and GMC velocity dispersion, which is consistent with various theoretical and simulation predictions. Specifically, we suggest that the $^{13}$CO/CO line ratio and the velocity dispersion can be used to infer $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ in starburst regions. By applying our modeled $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ in GMC analyses, we find that GMCs in the Antennae are less gravitationally bound than in normal spiral galaxies, which is more consistent with what is predicted by merger simulations. At kpc scale, we find that our modeled $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ values are smaller than the modeled $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ at GMC scale by 40%, which can be due to inclusion of a diffuse gas component with lower $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ values. We find a similar correlation of $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and CO intensity at kpc scales to that at GMC scales.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mergers or Truly Young? Intermediate-Age Stars on Highly-Radial Orbits in the Milky Way's Stellar Halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the mass assembly history of the Milky Way relies on obtaining detailed measurements of the properties of many stars in the Galaxy, especially in the stellar halo. One of the most constraining quantities is stellar age, as it can shed light on the accretion time and quenching of star formation in merging satellites. However, obtaining reliable age estimates for large samples of halo stars is difficult. We report published ages of 120 subgiant halo stars with highly-radial orbits that likely belong to the debris of the \textsl{Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage}~(GES) galaxy. The majority of these halo stars are old, with an age distribution characterized by a median of 11.6~Gyr and 16$^{\rm th}$(84$^{\rm th}$) percentile of 10.5~(12.7)~Gyr. However, the distribution is skewed, with a tail of younger stars that span ages down to $\sim6$--$9$ Gyr. All highly-radial halo stars have chemical and kinematic/orbital quantities that associate them with the GES debris. Initial results suggest that these intermediate-age stars are not a product of mass transfer and/or stellar mergers, which can bias their age determination low. If this conclusion is upheld by upcoming spectro-photometric studies, then the presence of these stars will pose an important challenge for constraining the properties of the GES merger and the accretion history of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Planck dust polarization power spectra are consistent with strongly supersonic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is rich in information but obscured by foreground emission from the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM). To uncover relationships between the underlying turbulent ISM and the foreground power spectra, we simulated a suite of driven, magnetized, turbulent models of the ISM, varying the fluid properties via the sonic Mach number, $\mathcal{M_S}$ and magnetic (Alfv\'en) Mach number,$\mathcal{M_A}$. We measure the power spectra of density ($\rho$), velocity ($v$), magnetic field ($H$), total projected intensity ($T$), parity-even polarization ($E$), and parity-odd polarization ($B$). We find that the slopes of all six quantities increase with $\mathcal{M_S}$ Most increase with $\mathcal{M_A}$, while the magnetic field spectrum steepens with $M_A$. By comparing spectral slopes of $E$ and $B$ to those measured by Planck, we infer typical values of $\mathcal{M_S}$ and $\mathcal{M_A}$ for the ISM. As the fluid velocity increases, $\mathcal{M_S}&gt; 4$, the ratio of BB power to EE power increases to approach a constant value near the Planck-observed value of $\sim 0.5$, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We also examine correlation-coefficients between projected quantities, and find that $r^{\rm{TE}}\approx 0.3$, in agreement with Planck, for appropriate combinations of $\mathcal{M_S}$ and $\mathcal{M_A}$. Finally, we consider parity-violating correlations $r^{\rm{TB}}$ and $r^{\rm{EB}}.$</description>

      <title>RUBIES: Evolved Stellar Populations with Extended Formation Histories at $z \sim 7-8$ in Candidate Massive Galaxies Identified with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of red, apparently massive galaxies at $z&gt;7$ in early JWST photometry suggests a strongly accelerated timeline compared to standard models of galaxy growth. A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or AGN. Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at $z=6.7-8.4$ have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at $\lambda_{\rm rest} = 0.4\,\mu$m, and require formation histories extending hundreds of Myr into the past in galaxies only 600--800 Myr after the Big Bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with H$\beta$ FWHM $&gt;2500~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting that dust-reddened AGN contribute to, or even dominate, the SEDs of these galaxies at $\lambda_{\rm rest}\gtrsim 0.6\,\mu$m. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically-relaxed, inclined disks. Yet, the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components, and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning $M_\star \sim 10^9 - 10^{11}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks for these objects are discussed, from the cores of massive galaxies to low-mass galaxies with over-massive black holes. Intriguingly, we find all of these explanations to be incomplete; deeper and redder data are needed to understand the physics of these systems.</description>

      <title>The equation and solution of 4-point correlation function of galaxies in Gaussian approximation and its parity-odd part</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with the density field equation of a self-gravity fluid in a static Universe, using the Schwinger functional differentiation technique, we derive the field equation of the 4-point correlation function (4PCF) of galaxies in the Gaussian approximation, which contains hierarchically 2PCF and 3PCF. By use of the known solutions of 2PCF and 3PCF, the equation of 4PCF becomes an inhomogeneous, Helmholtz equation, and contains only two physical parameters: the mass $m$ of galaxy and the Jeans wavenumber $k_J$, like the equations of the 2PCF and 3PCF. We obtain the analytical solution of 4PCF that consists of four portions, $\eta= \eta^0_{odd} + \eta^0_{even} +\eta^{FP} +\eta^I$, and has a very rich structure. $\eta^0_{odd}$ and $\eta^0_{even}$ form the homogeneous solution and depend on boundary conditions. The parity-odd $\eta^0_{odd}$ is more interesting and qualitatively explains the observed parity-odd data of BOSS CMASS, the parity-even $\eta^0_{even}$ contains the disconnected 4PCF $\eta^{disc}$ (arising from a Gaussian random process), and both $\eta^0_{odd}$ and $\eta^0_{even}$ are prominent at large scales $r\gtrsim 10$Mpc, and exhibit radial oscillations determined by the Jeans wavenumber. $\eta^{FP}$ and $ \eta^I$ are parity-even, and form the inhomogeneous solution. $\eta^{FP}$ is the same as the Fry-Peebles ansatz for 4PCF, and dominates at small scales $r \lesssim 10$Mpc. $\eta^I$ is an integration of the inhomogeneous term, subdominant. We also compare the parity-even 4PCF with the observation data.</description>

      <title>The formation and survival of cold gas in a magnetized cool-core galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filaments of cold gas ($T\leq 10^{4}$ K) are found in the inner regions of many cool-core clusters. These structures are thought to play a major role in the regulation of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We study the morphology of the filaments, their formation, and their impact on the propagation of the outflowing AGN jets. We present a set of GPU-accelerated 3D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster using the performance portable code AthenaPK. We include radiative cooling, and a self-regulated AGN feedback model that redistributes accreted material through kinetic, thermal and magnetic feedback. We confirm that magnetic fields play an important role in both the formation and evolution of the cold material. These suppress the formation of massive cold disks and favor magnetically supported filaments over clumpy structures. Achieving resolutions of $25-50$ pc, we find that filaments are not monolithic as they contain numerous and complex magnetically--supported substructures. We find that the mass distribution of these clumps follows a power law for all investigated filaments, consistent with previous cloud-crushing simulations of individual clumps. Studying the evolution of individual filaments, we find that their formation pathways can be diverse. We find examples of filaments forming through a combination of cold gas uplifting and condensation, as well as systems of purely infalling clumps condensing out of the intracluster medium. The density contrast between the cold gas and the outflowing hot material leads to recurring deflections of the jets, favoring inflation of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of An Apparent Red, High-Velocity Type Ia Supernova at z = 2.9 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of SN 2023adsy, a transient object located in a host galaxy JADES-GS$+53.13485$$-$$27.82088$ with a host spectroscopic redshift of $2.903\pm0.007$. The transient was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Photometric and spectroscopic followup with NIRCam and NIRSpec, respectively, confirm the redshift and yield UV-NIR light-curve, NIR color, and spectroscopic information all consistent with a Type Ia classification. Despite its classification as a likely SN Ia, SN 2023adsy is both fairly red (E(B-V)$\sim0.9$) despite a host galaxy with low-extinction and has a high Ca II velocity ($19,000\pm2,000$km/s) compared to the general population of SNe Ia. While these characteristics are consistent with some Ca-rich SNe Ia, particularly SN 2016hnk, SN 2023adsy is intrinsically brighter than the low-z Ca-rich population. Although such an object is too red for any low-z cosmological sample, we apply a fiducial standardization approach to SN 2023adsy and find that the SN 2023adsy luminosity distance measurement is in excellent agreement ($\lesssim1\sigma$) with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore unlike low-z Ca-rich SNe Ia, SN 2023adsy is standardizable and gives no indication that SN Ia standardized luminosities change significantly with redshift. A larger sample of distant SNe Ia is required to determine if SN Ia population characteristics at high-z truly diverge from their low-z counterparts, and to confirm that standardized luminosities nevertheless remain constant with redshift.</description>

      <title>Colliding red giants in galactic nuclei: Shocks, jets, impact on the ISM, X- and gamma-rays, neutrinos, fusion ignition and afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In galactic nuclei, stellar densities are so high that stars can physically collide with each other. In this work we focus on the collision of red giants and in particular on the formation of non-thermal processes through collisions and their properties. We analytically address these points by evaluating head-on collisions but also take into account scenarios with a deviation from the radial orbit, which we treat in a perturbative fashion. The collisions produce internal shocks with supersonic Mach numbers. Almost immediately, jet-like structures with important Lorentz factors form. The debris from the collision produces another shock wave which, when interacting with the interstellar medium of a galactic nucleus, leads to particle acceleration. We estimate the background flux in X- and gamma rays created by the background of these collisions by deriving the spectral index within a radius of 100 Mpc and find that they are high. Additionally, we make an estimate of the neutrino production and find about $10^{11}$ neutrinos per square meter per second for a collision at 100 Mpc from Earth. Also, we derive that there is a non-negligible chance to ignite fusion during the collision, due to the squeezing of the material. We investigate the possibility that the degenerate cores collide with each other, leading to a high afterglow luminosity, and find that it is non-negligible, although this should be addressed with dedicated numerical simulations. Colliding red giants in galactic nuclei trigger a plethora of high-energy phenomena, and have a particular gravitational wave emission associated, as shown by us, so that their detection will allow us to rule out alternatives.</description>

      <title>A Deficit of Massive White Dwarfs in Gaia Astrometric Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third data release of Gaia introduced a large catalog of astrometric binaries, out of which about 3,200 are likely main-sequence stars with a white-dwarf (WD) companion. These binaries are typically found with orbital separations of ~1 AU, a separation range that was largely unexplored due to observational challenges. Such systems are likely to have undergone a phase of stable mass transfer while the WD progenitor was on the asymptotic giant branch. Here we study the WD mass distribution of a volume-complete sample of binaries with K/M-dwarf primaries and orbital separations ~1 AU. We find that the number of massive WDs relative to the total number of WDs in these systems is smaller by an order of magnitude compared to their occurrence among single WDs in the field. One possible reason can be an implicit selection of the WD mass range if these are indeed post-stable-mass-transfer systems. Another reason can be the lack of merger products in our sample compared to the field, due to the relatively tight orbital separations of these systems. In addition, we find that about 14% of these systems have distant tertiary companions within 1 pc.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild black hole and redshift rapidity: A new approach towards measuring cosmic distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in estimating the mass-to-distance ratio of supermassive black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei, we introduce the new concept redshift rapidity in order to express the Schwarzschild black hole mass and its distance from the Earth just in terms of observational quantities. The redshift rapidity is also an observable relativistic invariant that represents the evolution of the frequency shift with respect to proper time in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We extract concise and elegant analytic formulas that allow us to disentangle mass and distance to black holes in the Schwarzschild background and estimate these parameters separately. This procedure is performed in a completely general relativistic way with the aim of improving the precision in measuring cosmic distances to astrophysical compact objects. Our exact formulas are valid on the midline and close to the line of sight, having direct astrophysical applications for megamaser systems, whereas the general relations can be employed in black hole parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a shock-compressed magnetic field in the north-western rim of the young supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 with X-ray polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide insights into cosmic-ray acceleration and magnetic field dynamics at shock fronts. Recent X-ray polarimetric measurements by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed radial magnetic fields near particle acceleration sites in young SNRs, including Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and SN 1006. We present here the spatially-resolved IXPE X-ray polarimetric observation of the northwestern rim of SNR RX J1713.7-3946. For the first time, our analysis shows that the magnetic field in particle acceleration sites of this SNR is oriented tangentially with respect to the shock front. Because of the lack of precise Faraday-rotation measurements in the radio band, this was not possible before. The average measured polarization degree (PD) of the synchtrotron emission is 12.5 {\pm} 3.3%, lower than the one measured by IXPE in SN 1006, comparable to the Tycho one, but notably higher than the one in Cassiopeia A. On sub-parsec scales, localized patches within RX J1713.7-3946 display PD up to 41.5 {\pm} 9.5%. These results are compatible with a shock-compressed magnetic field. However, in order to explain the observed PD, either the presence of a radial net magnetic field upstream of the shock, or partial reisotropization of the turbulence downstream by radial magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities, can be invoked. From comparison of PD and magnetic field distribution with {\gamma}-rays and 12 CO data, our results provide new inputs in favor of a leptonic origin of the {\gamma}-ray emission.</description>

      <title>WST -- Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: Motivation, science drivers and top-level requirements for a new dedicated facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) project. WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The telescope and instruments are designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next European Southern Observatory (ESO) project after completion of the 39-metre ELT.</description>
