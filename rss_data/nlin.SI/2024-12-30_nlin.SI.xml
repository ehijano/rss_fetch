      <title>The discrete Painlev\'{e} XXXIV hierarchy arising from the gap probability distributions of Freud unitary ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the symmetric gap probability distributions of certain Freud unitary ensembles. This problem is related to the Hankel determinants generated by the Freud weights supported on the complement of a symmetric interval. By using Chen and Ismail's ladder operator approach, we obtain the difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients for the orthogonal polynomials with the discontinuous Freud weights. We find that these equations, with a minor change of variables, are the discrete Painlev\'{e} XXXIV hierarchy proposed by Cresswell and Joshi [{\em J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.} {\bf 32} ({1999}) {655--669}]. We also derive the differential-difference equations for the recurrence coefficients and show the relationship between the logarithmic derivative of the gap probabilities, the nontrivial leading coefficients of the monic orthogonal polynomials and the recurrence coefficients.</description>

      <title>Characteristic integrals and general solution of the Ferapontov-Shabat-Yamilov lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the finite (non-periodic) systems obtained from a lattice introduced by Ferapontov and independently by Shabat and Yamilov, we present a quadrature-free general solution and a recurrent formula for the characteristic integrals. The derivation of these formulae relies on the underlying determinantal equations. We illustrate the results using a two-component system.</description>

      <title>Numerical inverse scattering transform for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with box-type initial conditions on a nonzero background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to solve numerically the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with a box-type initial condition (IC) having a nontrivial background of amplitude $q_o&gt;0$ as $x\to \pm \infty$ by implementing numerically the associated Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). The Riemann--Hilbert problem associated to the inverse transform is solved numerically by means of appropriate contour deformations in the complex plane following the numerical implementation of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. In this work, the box parameters are chosen so that there is no discrete spectrum (i.e., no solitons). In particular, the numerical method is demonstrated to be accurate within the two asymptotic regimes corresponding to two different regions of the $(x,t)$-plane depending on whether $|x/(2t)| &lt; q_o$ or $|x/(2t)| &gt; q_o$, as $t \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of smooth solitary waves for the modified Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions to the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. These solutions, which exist on a nonzero constant background $k$, are unique up to translation for each permissible value of $k$ and wave speed. By leveraging the Hamiltonian nature of the modified Camassa-Holm equation and employing three conserved functionals-comprising an energy and two Casimirs, we establish orbital stability through an analysis of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition. This stability pertains to perturbations of the momentum variable in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet energy and focusing NLS condensates of minimal intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the family of (poly)continua $\mathcal K$ in the upper half-plane ${\mathbb H} $ that contain a preassigned finite {\it anchor} set $E$. For a given harmonic external field we define a Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ and show that within each ``connectivity class'' of the family, there exists a minimizing compact $\mathcal K^*$ consisting of critical trajectories of a quadratic differential. In many cases this quadratic differential coincides with the square of the real normalized quasimomentum differential ${\rm d} {\mathbf p}$ associated with the finite gap solutions of the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (fNLS) defined by a hyperelliptic Riemann surface $\mathfrak R$ branched at the points $E\cup\bar E$.
  An fNLS soliton condensate is defined by a compact $\mathcal K\subset{\mathbb H} $ (its spectral support) whereas the average intensity of the condensate is proportional to $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ with external field given by $\Im z$. The motivation for this work lies in the problem of soliton condensate of least average intensity such that $E$ belongs to the poly-continuum $\mathcal K$. We prove that spectral support $\mathcal K^*$ provides the fNLS soliton condensate of the least average intensity within a given ``connectivity class''.</description>

      <title>Deautonomisation by singularity confinement and degree growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give an explanation of a number of observations relating to degree growth of birational mappings of the plane and their deautonomisation by singularity confinement. These observations are of a link between two a priori unrelated notions: firstly the dynamical degree of the mapping and secondly the evolution of parameters required for its singularity structure to remain unchanged under a sufficiently general deautonomisation. We explain this correspondence for a large class of birational mappings of the plane via the spaces of initial conditions for their deautonomised versions. We show that even for non-integrable mappings in this class, the surfaces forming these spaces have effective anticanonical divisors and one can define a period map parametrising them, similar to that in the theory of rational surfaces associated with discrete Painlev\'e equations. This provides a bridge between the evolution of coefficients in the deautonomised mapping and the induced dynamics on the Picard lattice which encode the dynamical degree.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum or classical many-body Hamiltonian systems characterized by integrable contact interactions supplemented by a generic two-body potential, potentially long-range. We show how the dynamics of local observables is given in terms of a generalised version of Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy, which we denote as gBBGKY, which is built for the densities, and their correlations, of the quasiparticles of the underlying integrable model. Unlike the usual cases of perturbation theory from free gases, the presence of local interactions in the integrable model "lifts" the so-called kinetic blocking, and the second layer of the hierarchy reproduces the dynamics at all time-scales. The latter consists of a fast pre-equilibration to a non-thermal steady state, and its subsequent thermalisation to a Gibbs ensemble. We show how the final relaxation is encoded into a Boltzmann scattering integral involving three or higher body-scatterings, and which, remarkably, is entirely determined by the diffusion constants of the underlying integrable model. We check our results with exact molecular dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. Our results show how gBBGKY can be successfully employed in quantum systems to compute scattering integrals and Fermi's golden rule transition rates.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>Soliton Shielding of the focusing modified KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider soliton gas solutions of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, where the point spectrum of the condensate is located within a bounded domain in the upper half-plane. We first demonstrate that when the domain is a quadrature and the soliton density is an analytic function, the corresponding deterministic soliton gas coincides with a finite number of solitons, which we call this effect soliton shielding. When the domain is an ellipse and the soliton density is analytic, the corresponding deterministic soliton gas reduces the spectral data to the segment joining the foci. The initial datum of this Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory, described by a periodic elliptic function as \( x \to +\infty \), and it vanishes exponentially fast as \( x \to -\infty \).</description>
