      <title>Semi-classical limit for Klein-Gordon equation toward relativistic Euler equations via an adapted modulated energy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the convergence of the solutions to the massive nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation toward solutions to a relativistic Euler with potential type system in the semi-classical limit. In particular, the momentum and the density of Klein-Gordon converge to the the momentum and the density of the relativistic Euler system in Lebesgue norms. The relativistic Euler with potential is equivalent to the usual relativistic Euler with pressure up to a rescaling. The proof relies on the modulated energy method adapted to the wave equation and the relativistic setting.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem for quasi-linear parabolic systems revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of parabolic quasilinear systems, in which the diffusion matrix is not uniformly elliptic, but satisfies a Petrovskii condition of positivity of the real part of the eigenvalues. Local wellposedness is known since the work of Amann in the 90s, by a semi-group method. We revisit these results in the context of Sobolev spaces modelled on L^2 and exemplify our method with the SKT system, showing the existence of local, non-negative, strong solutions.</description>

      <title>Approximation of topological singularities through free discontinuity functionals: the critical and super-critical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further investigate the properties of an approach to topological singularities through free discontinuity functionals of Mumford-Shah type proposed in \cite{DLSVG}. We prove the variational equivalence between such energies, Ginzburg-Landau, and Core-Radius for anti-plane screw dislocations energies in dimension two, in the relevant energetic regimes $|\log \varepsilon|^a$, $a\geq 1$, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the linear size of the process zone near the defects.
  Further, we remove the \emph{a priori} restrictive assumptions that the approximating order parameters have compact jump set. This is obtained by proving a new density result for $\mathbb S^1$-valued $SBV^p$ functions, approximated through functions with essentially closed jump set, in the strong $BV$ norm.</description>

      <title>Polynomial tail solutions of the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation near local Maxwellians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to incorporate the Caflisch's decomposition into the macro-micro decomposition in Boltzmann theory for allowing the microscopic component to exhibit only the polynomial tail in large velocities. In particular, we treat the Cauchy problem on the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation under the compressible Euler scaling in case of three-dimensional whole space. Up to a finite time we construct the Boltzmann solution around a local Maxwellian corresponding to small-amplitude classical solutions of the full compressible Euler system around constant states. We design a new energy functional which can capture the convergence rate in the small Knudsen number $\varepsilon$ and allow the microscopic part of solutions to decay polynomially in large velocities. Moreover, the energy norm of perturbations can be of the order $\varepsilon^{1/2}$ which the usual method of Hilbert expansion fails to obtain. As a byproduct of the proof, our estimates immediately yield a global-in-time existence result when the Euler solutions are taken to be constant states.</description>

      <title>A geometrical approach to the sharp Hardy inequality in Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a partial negative answer to a question left open in a previous work by Brasco and the first and third-named authors concerning the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality on convex sets. Our approach has a geometrical flavor and equivalently reformulates the sharp constant in the limit case $p=1$ as the Cheeger constant for the fractional perimeter and the Lebesgue measure with a suitable weight. As a by-product, we obtain new lower bounds on the sharp constant in the $1$-dimensional case, even for non-convex sets, some of which optimal in the case $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical Hardy, Sobolev type and Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities and identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss cylindrical extensions of improved Hardy, Sobolev type and Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with sharp constants and identities in the spirit of Badiale-Tarantello [2]. All identities are obtained in the setting of $L^p$ for all $p\in (1,\infty)$ without the real-valued function assumption. The obtained identities provide a simple and direct understanding of these inequalities as well as the nonexistence of nontrivial extremizers. As a byproduct, we show extended Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with remainder terms that imply a cylindrical extension of the classical Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle. Furthermore, we prove $L^p$-Hardy type identities with logarithmic weights that imply the critical Hardy inequality in the special case. Lastly, we also discuss extensions of these results on homogeneous Lie groups. Particular attention is paid to stratified Lie groups, where the functional inequalities become intricately intertwined with the properties of sub-Laplacians and related hypoelliptic partial differential equations. The obtained results already imply new insights even in the classical Euclidean setting with respect to the range of parameters and the arbitrariness of the choice of any homogeneous quasi-norm.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the ill-posedness of a quasi-linear wave equation in two dimensions with initial data in $H^{7/4} (\ln H^{-\beta})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is the continuation of \cite{ohlmann2021illposedness} where we exhibited the ill-posedness of a quasi-linear wave equation in dimension $2$ for initial data in $H^{7/4}(\ln H^{7/4})$. Here, we look at modifications of the equation and show that the blow-up phenomenon still occurs. First, we study another equation with the same characteristics but a different underlying ODE. Later, we study an equation where a $x_2$ dependency is introduced. The latter case constitutes the main contribution of this paper, as we are able to show that the solution still behaves pathologically without having an explicit formula for either the characteristics or the values of the solution. Finally, we study the case where a perturbation of the initial data is introduced.</description>

      <title>Construction of blow-up solutions for the focusing critical-energy nonlinear wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\mathbb{R}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to exhibit solutions $u(x,t)$ of the focusing, critical energy, nonlinear wave equation \begin{equation} \partial_{tt}u - \Delta u - |u|^{p-1}u = 0, \quad t \geq 0, \ x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ d \geq 3, \ p = (d+2)/(d-2) \end{equation} in dimension $d \in \{4,5\}$ where a finite-time Type II blow-up (meaning the solution blows-up while the energy remains bounded) occurs exactly at $x = t = 0$ with a prescribed polynomial blow-up rate $t^{-1-\nu}$ with $\nu &gt; 1$ when $d = 4$ and $\nu &gt; 3$ when $d = 5$. Such solutions have been constructed by Krieger-Schlag-Tataru in $d = 3$ and by Jendrej in $d = 5$. The result from Jendrej covers the extremal case $\nu = 3$, which we are missing, and any $\nu &gt; 8$. Surprisingly, no one else has treated the $d = 4$ case yet. The major difference between dimensions 4 and 5 in our paper lies in this renormalization procedure. In $d = 4$, we essentially follow Krieger-Schlag-Tataru scheme used for the 3D equation. This scheme has been used with success in other equations such as the 3D-critical NLS, Schr\"odinger maps or wave maps. In all of these cases, the non-linearity is a polynomial, which allows to treat the error terms using simple algebra rules. In $d = 5$, the setup needs to be modified because the nonlinearity of the equation has a much lower regularity and it is not clear anymore how one should deal with the nonlinear error terms.</description>

      <title>Propagation and non-reciprocity in time-modulated diffusion through the lens of high-order homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homogenization procedure developed here is conducted on a laminate with periodic space-time modulation on the fine scale: at leading order, this modulation creates convection in the low-wavelength regime if both parameters are modulated. However, if only one parameter is modulated, which is more realistic, this convective term disappears and one recovers a standard diffusion equation with effective homogeneous parameters; this does not describe the non-reciprocity and the propagation of the field observed from exact dispersion diagrams. This inconsistency is corrected here by considering second-order homogenization which results in a non-reciprocal propagation term that is proved to be non-zero for any laminate and verified via numerical simulation. The same methodology is also applied to the case when the density is modulated in the heat equation, leading therefore to a corrective advective term which cancels out non-reciprocity at the leading order but not at the second order.</description>

      <title>On the collective effect of a large system of heavy particles immersed in a Newtonian fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a large number of heavy particles in a Newtonian fluid occupying a bounded spatial domain. When we say "heavy", we mean a particle with a mass density that approaches infinity at an appropriate rate as its radius vanishes. We show that the collective effect of heavy particles on the fluid motion is similar to the Brinkman perturbation of the Navier-Stokes system identified in the homogenization process.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov function and smooth periodic solutions to quasilinear 1D hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a Lyapunov function to obtain conditions for the existence and uniqueness of small classical time-periodic solutions to first order quasilinear 1D hyperbolic systems with (nonlinear) nonlocal boundary conditions in a strip. The boundary conditions cover different types of reflections from the boundary as well as integral operators with delays. In the first step we use a Lyapunov approach to derive sufficient conditions for the robust exponential stability of the boundary value problems for a linear(ized) homogeneous problem. Under those conditions and a number of non-resonance conditions, in the second step we prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth time-periodic solutions to the corresponding linear nonhomogeneous problems. In the third step, we prove a perturbation theorem stating that the periodic solutions survive under small perturbations of all coefficients of the hyperbolic system. In the last step, we apply the linear results to construct small and smooth time-periodic solutions to the quasilinear problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Landau-Coulomb equation and show an explicit blow-down mechanism for a family of initial data that are small-scale, supercritical perturbations of a Maxwellian function. We establish global well-posedness and show that the initial bump region will disappear in a time of order one. We prove that the function remains close to an explicit function during the blow-down. As a consequence, our result shows exponential decay in time of the solution towards equilibrium. The key ingredients of our proof are the explicit blow-down function and a novel two-scale linearization in appropriate time-dependent spaces that yields uniform estimates in the perturbation parameter.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a recent paper of G. Liu and X. Tan (2023), we would like to measure how the magnetic effect appears in the heat trace formula associated with the magnetic Laplacian and the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. We propose to the reader an overview of magnetic heat trace formulas through explicit examples. On the way we obtain new formulas and in particular we calculate explicitely some non local terms and logarithmic terms appearing in the Steklov heat trace asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On integrability of a new dynamical system associated with the BBM-type hydrodynamic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the exceptional integrability property of a family of higher-order Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM)-type nonlinear dispersive equations. Here, we highlight its deep relationship with a generalized infinite hierarchy of the integrable Riemann-type hydrodynamic equations. A previous Lie symmetry analysis revealed a particular case which was conjectured to be integrable. Namely, a Lie-Baecklund symmetry exists, thus highlighting another associated dynamical system. Here, we investigate these two equations using the gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Moreover, we construct their infinite hierarchy of conservation laws analytically, using three compatible Poisson structures to prove the complete integrability of both dynamical systems. We investigate these two equations using the so-called gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Based on this scheme, applied to the equation under consideration, we have analytically constructed its infinite hierarchy of conservation laws, derived two compatible Poisson structures and proved its complete integrability.</description>

Abstract: We study the regularity of Lipschitz viscosity solutions to the $\sigma_k$ Yamabe problem in the negative cone case. If either $k=n$ or the manifold is conformally flat and $k&gt;n/2$, we prove that all Lipschitz viscosity solutions are smooth away from a closed set of measure zero. For the general $k&gt;n/2$ case, under certain assumptions, we prove the existence of a Lipschitz viscosity solution that is smooth away from a closed set of measure zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial-boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous non-cutoff Boltzmann equation is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we study the stability and long-time dynamics of the Boltzmann equation near a global Maxwellian without angular cutoff assumption in a general $C^3$ bounded domain $\Omega$ (including convex and non-convex cases) with physical boundary conditions: inflow and Maxwell-reflection (including diffuse reflection) boundary conditions. We obtain the global-in-time existence, which has an exponential decay rate for the inflow boundary for both hard and soft potentials, and for the Maxwell-reflection boundary for hard potentials. The crucial method is to extend the boundary problem in a bounded domain to the whole space without regular velocity dissipation, followed by an improved De Giorgi iteration with a large iteration constant and the $L^2$--$L^\infty$ method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01221v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove boundedness, H\"older continuity, Harnack inequality results for local quasiminima to elliptic double phase problems of $p$-Laplace type in the general context of metric measure spaces. The proofs follow a variational approach and they are based on the De Giorgi method, a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic geometries.</description>

      <title>Remarks on variable Lebesgue spaces and fractional Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, under the action of an external force and with the fractional Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ in the diffusion term, from the point of view of variable Lebesgue spaces. Based on decay estimates of the fractional heat kernel we prove the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions on this functional setting. Thus, in a first theorem we obtain an unique local-in-time solution in the space $L^{p(\cdot)} \left( [0,T], L^{q} (\mathbb{R}^3) \right)$. As a bi-product, in a second theorem we prove the existence of an unique global-in-time solution in the mixed-space $\mathcal{L}^{p(\cdot)}_{\frac{3}{2\alpha -1}}(\mathbb{R}^3,L^\infty([0,T[))$.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoanisotropic estimates for fundamental frequencies of membranes and connections with shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underlying motivation of the present work lies on one of the cornerstone problems in spectral optimization that consists of determining sharp lower and upper uniform estimates for fundamental frequencies of a set of uniformly elliptic operators on a given membrane. Our approach allows to give a complete solution of the problem for the general class of anisotropic operators in divergence form generated by arbitrary norms on R^2, including the computation of optimal constants and the characterization of all anisotropic extremizers. Such achievements demand that isoanisotropic type problems be addressed within the broader environment of nonnegative, convex and 1-homogeneous anisotropies and involve a deep and fine analysis of least energy levels associated to anisotropies with maximum degeneracy. As a central outcome we find out a key close relation between shapes and fundamental frequencies for rather degenerate elliptic operators. Our findings also permit to establish that the supremum of anisotropic fundamental frequencies over all fixed-area membranes is infinite for any nonzero anisotropy. This particularly proves the well-known maximization conjecture for fundamental frequencies of the p-laplacian for any p other than 2. Our new sharp lower estimate is just the planar isoanisotropic counterpart of the Faber-Krahn isoperimetric inequality and for the associated optimal constant we provide optimal geometric controls through isodiametric and isoperimetric shape optimization.</description>

      <title>The existence of solutions for a Schrodinger equation with jumping nonlinearities crossing the essential spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of one solution for a Schr\"{o}dinger equation with jumping nonlinearities: $-\Delta u+V(x)u=f(x,u)$, $x\in \mathbb {R}^N$, and $u(x)\to 0$, $|x|\to +\infty$, where $V$ is a potential function on which we make hypotheses, and in particular allow $V$ which is unbounded below, and $f(x,u)=au^-+bu^++g(x,u)$. No restriction on $b$ is required, which implies that $f(x,s)s^{-1}$ may interfere with the essential spectrum of $ -\Delta+V$ for $s\to +\infty$. Using the truncation method and the Morse theory, we can compute critical groups of the corresponding functional at zero and infinity, then prove the existence of one negative solution.</description>

      <title>Geometric embedding for regularity structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how one can view certain models in regularity structures as some form of geometric rough paths. This is performed by identifying the deformed Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra with a quotient of the shuffle Hopf algebra which is the structure underlying the definition of a geometric rough path. This provides an extension of the isomorphism between the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and the shuffle Hopf algebra. This new algebraic result relies strongly on the deformation formalism and the post-Lie structures introduced recently in the context of regularity structures.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow calculations for reducible solutions to the massive Vafa-Witten equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vafa-Witten equations (with or without a mass term) constitute a non-linear, first order system of differential equations on a given oriented, compact, Riemannian 4-manifold. Because these are the variational equations of a functional, the linearized equations at any given solution can be used to define an elliptic, first order, self-adjoint differential operator. The purpose of this article is to give bounds (upper and lower) for the spectral flow between respective versions of this operator that are defined by the elements in diverging sequences of reducible solutions. (The spectral flow is formally the difference between the respective Morse indices of the solutions when they are viewed as critical points of the functional.) In some cases, the absolute value of the spectral flow is bounded along the sequence, whereas in others it diverges. This is a curious state of affairs. In any event, the analysis introduces localization and excision techniques to calculate spectral flow which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A model for slowing particles in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple model in dimension $d\geq 2$ for slowing particles in random media, where point particles move in straight lines among and inside spherical identical obstacles with Poisson distributed centres. When crossing an obstacle, a particle is slowed down according to the law $\dot{V}= -\frac{\kappa}{\epsilon} S(|V|) V$, where $V$ is the velocity of the point particle, $\kappa$ is a positive constant, $\epsilon$ is the radius of the obstacle and $S(|V|)$ is a given slowing profile. With this choice, the slowing rate in the obstacles is such that the variation of speed at each crossing is of order $1$. We study the asymptotic limit of the particle system when $\epsilon$ vanishes and the mean free path of the point particles stays finite. We prove the convergence of the point particles density measure to the solution of a kinetic-like equation with a collision term which includes a contribution proportional to a $\delta$ function in $v=0$; this contribution guarantees the conservation of mass for the limit equation.</description>
