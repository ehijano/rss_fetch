      <title>Recognizing Penny and Marble Graphs is Hard for Existential Theory of the Reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the recognition problem for penny graphs (contact graphs of unit disks in the plane) is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, that is, computationally as hard as the existential theory of the reals, even if a combinatorial plane embedding of the graph is given. The exact complexity of the penny graph recognition problem has been a long-standing open problem.
  We lift the penny graph result to three dimensions and show that the recognition problem for marble graphs (contact graphs of unit balls in three dimensions) is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete.
  Finally, we show that rigidity of penny graphs is $\forall\mathbb{R}$-complete and look at grid embeddings of penny graphs that are trees.</description>

      <title>Computing the Fr\'echet Distance When Just One Curve is $c$-Packed: A Simple Almost-Tight Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study approximating the continuous Fr\'echet distance of two curves with complexity $n$ and $m$, under the assumption that only one of the two curves is $c$-packed. Driemel, Har{-}Peled and Wenk DCG'12 studied Fr\'echet distance approximations under the assumption that both curves are $c$-packed. In $\mathbb{R}^d$, they prove a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(d \, c\,\frac{n+m}{\varepsilon})$ time. Bringmann and K\"unnemann IJCGA'17 improved this to $\tilde{O}(c\,\frac{n + m }{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$ time, which they showed is near-tight under SETH. Recently, Gudmundsson, Mai, and Wong ISAAC'24 studied our setting where only one of the curves is $c$-packed. They provide an involved $\tilde{O}( d \cdot (c+\varepsilon^{-1})(cn\varepsilon^{-2} + c^2m\varepsilon^{-7} + \varepsilon^{-2d-1}))$-time algorithm when the $c$-packed curve has $n$ vertices and the arbitrary curve has $m$, where $d$ is the dimension in Euclidean space. In this paper, we show a simple technique to compute a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in time $O(d \cdot c\,\frac{n+m}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{n+m}{\varepsilon})$ when one of the curves is $c$-packed. Our approach is not only simpler than previous work, but also significantly improves the dependencies on $c$, $\varepsilon$, and $d$. Moreover, it almost matches the asymptotically tight bound for when both curves are $c$-packed. Our algorithm is robust in the sense that it does not require knowledge of $c$, nor information about which of the two input curves is $c$-packed.</description>
