      <title>Finding signatures of low-dimensional geometric landscapes in high-dimensional cell fate transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicellular organisms develop a wide variety of highly-specialized cell types. The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify universal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data.</description>

      <title>Biological Processes as Exploratory Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological processes can be thought of as the result of an underlying dynamics in which the system repeatedly undergoes distinct and abortive trajectories with the dynamical process only ending when some specific process, purpose, structure or function is achieved. A classic example is the way in which microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome segregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then stacked against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series of repeated trials that ultimately end in a "winning" trajectory. We also explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such processes.</description>

      <title>CellFlux: Simulating Cellular Morphology Changes via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research. Project page: https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/CellFlux/.</description>
