      <title>Launching AoyuX: A 25-Year Pseudo-Prospective Earthquake Forecasting Experiment at the China Seismic Experimental Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecast models in statistical seismology are commonly evaluated with log-likelihood scores of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake numbers, yet heavy tails and out-of-range observations can bias model ranking. We develop a tail-aware evaluation framework that estimates cell-wise P(n) using adaptive Gaussian kernel density estimation and tests three strategies for handling out-of-range counts. Using the AoyuX platform, we perform a ~25-year month-by-month pseudo-prospective forecast experiment in the China Seismic Experimental Site (CSES), comparing Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model with a homogeneous background (ETAS{\mu}) to a spatially heterogeneous variant (ETAS{\mu}(x,y)) across six spatial resolutions and five magnitude thresholds. Empirical probability density functions (PDFs) of counts per cell are well described by power laws with exponents a = 1.40 +- 0.21 across all settings. Using previous theoretical results, this provides a robust estimate of the productivity exponent, {\alpha} = 0.57 +- 0.08 using a b-value equal to 0.8, providing a valuable quantification of this key parameter in aftershock modeling. Model ranking is sensitive to how the tail of the full distribution P(n) of earthquake counts is treated: power law extrapolation is both theoretically justified and empirically the most robust. Cumulative information gain (CIG) shows that ETAS{\mu}(x,y) outperforms ETAS{\mu} in data-rich configurations, whereas in data-poor settings stochastic fluctuations dominate. A coefficient-of-variation analysis of per-window log-likelihood differences distinguishes genuine upward trends in CIG from noise-dominated fluctuations. By aligning a fat-tail-aware scoring methodology with an open testing platform, our work advances fair and statistically grounded assessment of earthquake forecasting models for the CSES and beyond.</description>

      <title>A vertically integrated model with phase change for aquifers in cold firn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface meltwater from glaciers and ice sheets contributes significantly to sea level rise, yet the dynamics governing its transport and retention in cold firn remain poorly constrained. We present a vertically integrated model that includes phase change during the migration of aquifers in cold firn and a constant residual trapping of liquid water. The model provides a unified framework connecting gravity-driven flows in temperate soils with those in cold firn, highlighting the analogous physics governing both systems. Analytical solutions are derived for constant volume aquifers and validated against numerical solutions that can be used to elucidate key features of meltwater dynamics and serve as benchmarks for firn hydrologic models. Finally, we demonstrate a three-dimensional expansion of an aquifer in cold, heterogeneous firn. The analytical and numerical solutions demonstrate that the dynamics of the laterally propagating aquifer slow at lower initial firn temperatures because of the enhanced reduction in porosity and the associated loss of liquid water. In summary, our framework offers insights into the formation and evolution of firn aquifers in percolation zones, which will help elucidate the role of modulating meltwater fluxes that affect surface mass loss and contribute to changes in global sea levels.</description>

      <title>Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 1: training on fluvial deposits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity. This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of promise.</description>

      <title>Unifying Frictional Transients Reveals the Origin of Static Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional motion is harder to initiate than to sustain, as evident when pushing a heavy object. This disparity between static and kinetic friction drives instabilities and stick-slip dynamics in systems ranging from nanodevices and MEMS to squealing brakes, glaciers and tectonic faults, yet its origin and the transition mechanism remain poorly understood. Empirical rate-and-state friction laws predict that during the static-to-kinetic transition, friction increases for nanometer-per-second slip rates, but decreases for micrometers-per-second rates and above. These transients are believed to be associated with contact strengthening (aging) at static interfaces, although their physical basis is unclear and the crossover between regimes has never been observed directly. Here we show, through nanometer-resolution sliding experiments on macroscopic rough surfaces, that these transients are segments of a single, universal non-monotonic response whose peak defines static friction. We show that this behavior arises from mechanical reorganization of interlocking surface asperities under shear, fundamentally distinct from contact aging, which is governed by thermal molecular processes. We derive, from first principles and without invoking any empirical postulates, a differential equation that quantitatively captures the friction peak. These results unify frictional transients across scales and speeds, and establish a physics-based framework for understanding frictional instabilities and failure processes in engineering and geosciences.</description>
