      <title>Algorithmic Applications of Tyshkevich's Graph Decomposition: A Primer and a Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph that is completely determined by its degree sequence is called a unigraph. In 2000, Regina Tyshkevich published one of the most important papers on unigraphs. There are two parts to the paper: a decomposition theorem that describes how every graph can be broken into a sequence of basic graphs and a complete classification of all basic unigraphs. Together, they reveal how every unigraph is constructed. We provide an informal overview of Tyshkevich's results and show how they enable the computation of various graph parameters of unigraphs in linear time. We also created a toolkit (https://chelseal11.github.io/tyshkevich_decomposition_toolkit/) that implements the algorithms described in this write-up.</description>

      <title>Improving the Graph Challenge Reference Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MIT/IEEE/Amazon Graph Challenge provides a venue for individuals and teams to showcase new innovations in large-scale graph and sparse data analysis. The Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge processes over 100 billion network packets to construct privacy-preserving traffic matrices, with a GraphBLAS reference implementation demonstrating how hypersparse matrices can be applied to this problem. This work presents a refactoring and benchmarking of a section of the reference code to improve clarity, adaptability, and performance. The original Python implementation spanning approximately 1000 lines across 3 files has been streamlined to 325 lines across two focused modules, achieving a 67% reduction in code size while maintaining full functionality. Using pMatlab and pPython distributed array programming libraries, the addition of parallel maps allowed for parallel benchmarking of the data. Scalable performance is demonstrated for large-scale summation and analysis of traffic matrices. The resulting implementation increases the potential impact of the Graph Challenge by providing a clear and efficient foundation for participants.</description>

      <title>From Historical Puzzles to Grammatical Constraints: Circular Partitions, Generalized Run-Length Encodings, and Polynomial-Time Decidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a historical combinatorial problem that resembles the well-known Josephus problem, we investigate circular partition algorithms and formulate problems in deterministic finite automata with practical algorithms. The historical problem involves arranging individuals on a circle and eliminating every k-th person until a desired group remains. We analyze both removal and non-removal approaches to circular partitioning, establishing conditions for balanced partitions and providing explicit algorithms. We introduce generalized run-length encodings over partitioned alphabets to capture alternating letter patterns, computing their cardinalities using Stirling numbers of the second kind. Connecting these combinatorial structures to formal language theory, we formulate an existence problem: given a context-free grammar over a dictionary and block-pattern constraints on letters, does a valid sentence exist? We prove decidability in polynomial time by showing block languages are regular and applying standard parsing techniques. Complete algorithms with complexity analysis are provided and validated through implementation on both historical and synthetic instances.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Santa Claus, Hypergraphs and Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.07189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known problem in scheduling and approximation algorithms is the Santa Claus problem. Suppose that Santa Claus has a set of gifts, and he wants to distribute them among a set of children so that the least happy child is made as happy as possible. Here, the value that a child $i$ has for a present $j$ is of the form $p_{ij} \in \{ 0,p_j\}$. A polynomial time algorithm by Annamalai et al. gives a $12.33$-approximation and is based on a modification of Haxell's hypergraph matching argument.
  In this paper, we introduce a matroid version of the Santa Claus problem. Our algorithm is also based on Haxell's augmenting tree, but with the introduction of the matroid structure we solve a more general problem with cleaner methods. Our result can then be used as a blackbox to obtain a $(6+\varepsilon)$-approximation for Santa Claus. This factor also compares against a natural, compact LP for Santa Claus.</description>

      <title>Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oriented line graph, introduced by Kotani and Sunada (2000), is closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix (1989). It is known that for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the oriented line graph $\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the Ihara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomial of the $z$-Hermitian adjacency matrix of $\vec{L}(G)$ for each $z\in \mathbb{C}$ and $d$-regular graph $G$ with $d\geq 3$. Special cases of this matrix include the Hermitian adjacency matrix of $\vec{L}(G)$ and the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\vec{L}(G)$. We also exhibit an application to star coloring of graphs.</description>

      <title>General Strong Bound on the Uncrossed Number which is Tight for the Edge Crossing Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a very recent concept for visualizing various aspects of a graph in the plane using a collection of drawings introduced by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik [GD 2023]. Formally, given a graph $G$, we aim to find an uncrossed collection containing drawings of $G$ in the plane such that each edge of $G$ is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. The uncrossed number of $G$ ($unc(G)$) is the smallest integer $k$ such that an uncrossed collection for $G$ of size $k$ exists. The uncrossed number is lower-bounded by the well-known thickness, which is an edge-decomposition of $G$ into planar graphs. This connection gives a trivial lower-bound $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6}\rceil \le unc(G)$. In a recent paper, Balko, Hlin\v{e}n\'y, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Orthaber, Vogtenhuber, and Wagner [GD 2024] presented the first non-trivial and general lower-bound on the uncrossed number. We summarize it in terms of dense graphs (where $|E(G)|=\epsilon(|V(G)|)^2$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$): $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c_\epsilon|V(G)|}\rceil \le unc(G)$, where $c_\epsilon\ge 2.82$ is a constant depending on $\epsilon$.
  We improve the lower-bound to state that $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6-\sqrt{2|E(G)|}+\sqrt{6(|V(G)|-2)}}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Translated to dense graphs regime, the bound yields a multiplicative constant $c'_\epsilon=3-\sqrt{(2-\epsilon)}$ in the expression $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c'_\epsilon|V(G)|+o(|V(G)|)}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Hence, it is tight (up to low-order terms) for $\epsilon \approx \frac{1}{2}$ as warranted by complete graphs.
  In fact, we formulate our result in the language of the maximum uncrossed subgraph number, that is, the maximum number of edges of $G$ that are not crossed in a drawing of $G$ in the plane. In that case, we also provide a construction certifying that our bound is asymptotically tight (up to low-order terms) on dense graphs for all $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Codes Correcting Transpositions of Consecutive Symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of correcting transpositions (or swaps) of consecutive symbols in $ q $-ary strings is studied. Lower bounds on asymptotically achievable rates of codes correcting $ t = \tau n $ transpositions are derived. The first bound is obtained by analyzing the average cardinality of ``transposition balls'' and evaluating the appropriate version of the generalized Gilbert--Varshamov bound, while the second bound follows from a construction of codes correcting an arbitrary number of transpositions (i.e., zero-error codes). Asymptotic bounds on the cardinality of optimal codes correcting $ t = \textrm{const} $ transpositions are also derived.</description>
