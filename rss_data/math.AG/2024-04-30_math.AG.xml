      <title>The Procesi bundle over the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $n \geq 1$, we study the fibers of the Procesi bundle over the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in the plane. For each irreducible component of this fixed point locus, our approach reduces the study of the fibers of the Procesi bundle, as an $(\mathfrak{S}_n \times \Gamma)$-module, to the study of the fibers of the Procesi bundle over an irreducible component of dimension zero in a smaller Hilbert scheme. When $\Gamma$ is of type $A$, our main result shows, as a corollary, that the fiber of the Procesi bundle over the monomial ideal associated with a partition $\lambda$ is induced, as an $(\mathfrak{S}_n \times \Gamma)$-module, from the fiber of the Procesi bundle over the monomial ideal associated with the core of $\lambda$. We give different proofs of this corollary in two edge cases, using only representation theory and symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Hyperquot schemes on curves: virtual class and motivic invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve, $E$ a locally free sheaf. Hyperquot schemes on $C$ parametrise flags of coherent quotients of $E$ with fixed Hilbert polynomial, and offer alternative compactifications to the spaces of maps from $C$ to partial flag varieties. Motivated by enumerative geometry, in this paper we construct a perfect obstruction theory (and hence a virtual class and a virtual structure sheaf) on these moduli spaces, which we use to provide criteria for smoothness and unobstructedness. Under these assumptions, we determine their motivic partition function in the Grothendieck ring of varieties, in terms of the motivic zeta function of $C$.</description>

      <title>Amalgams of matroids, fibre products and tropical graph correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the proper amalgam of matroids $M_1$ and $M_2$ along their common restriction $N$ exists if and only if the tropical fibre product of Bergman fans ${B(M_1) \times_{B(N)} B(M_2)}$ is positive. We introduce tropical correspondences between Bergman fans as tropical subcycles in their product, similar to correspondences in algebraic geometry, and define a "graph correspondence" of the map of lattices. We prove that graph construction is a functor for the "covering" maps of lattices, exploiting a generalization of Bergman fan which we call a "Flag fan".</description>

      <title>Reading the log canonical threshold of a plane curve singularity from its Newton polyhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a proposition due to Koll\'ar 1997 on computing log canonical thresholds of certain hypersurface germs using weighted blowups, which we extend to weighted blowups with non-negative weights. Using this, we show that the log canonical threshold of a convergent complex power series is at most $1/c$, where $(c, \ldots, c)$ is a point on a facet of its Newton polyhedron. Moreover, in the case $n = 2$, if the power series is weakly normalised with respect to this facet or the point $(c, c)$ belongs to two facets, then we have equality. This generalises a theorem of Varchenko 1982 to non-isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>The minimal exponent of cones over smooth complete intersection projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the minimal exponent of the affine cone over a complete intersection of smooth projective hypersurfaces intersecting transversely. The upper bound for the minimal exponent is proved, more generally, in the weighted homogeneous setting, while the lower bound is deduced from a general lower bound in terms of a strong factorizing resolution in the sense of Bravo and Villamayor.</description>

      <title>Slopes of fibrations with trivial vertical fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kodaira fibrations have non-trivial vertical fundamental groups and their slopes are all $12$. In this paper, we show that $12$ is indeed the sharp upper bound for the slopes of fibrations with trivial vertical fundamental groups. Precisely, for each $g\geq3$ we prove the existence of fibrations of genus $g$ with trivial vertical fundamental groups whose slopes can be arbitrarily close to $12$. This gives a relative analogy of Roulleau-Urz\'ua's work on the slopes of surfaces of general type with trivial fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>A Nygaard Approach to Values of Zeta Functions of Schemes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss a streamlined proof of a result due to Milne computing special values of zeta functions for smooth proper schemes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. The proof will give a natural interpretation of the correction factor in terms of invariants constructed from prismatic cohomology, studied by Morin. We then discuss the modifications needed when passing from the smooth case to an arbitrary qcqs scheme $X$ of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$, at least assuming a strong form of resolution of singularities.</description>

      <title>On Normality of Projective Hypersurfaces with an Additive Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projective hypersurfaces $X$ admitting an induced additive action, i.e., an effective action ${\mathbb G_a^m\times X\to X}$ of the vector group $\mathbb G_a^m$ with an open orbit that can be extended to an action on the ambient projective space. A criterion for normality of such a hypersurface $X$ is given. Also, we prove that for any projective hypersurface $Z$ there exists a hypersurface $X$ with an induced additive action such that the complement to the open $\mathbb G_a^m$-orbit in $X$ is a projective cone over $Z$. We introduce a construction that produces non-degenerate hypersurfaces with induced additive action from Young diagrams and study the properties of the hypersurfaces obtained in this way.</description>

      <title>Triality over Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working over an arbitrary base scheme, we provide an alternative development of triality which does not use Octonion algebras or symmetric composition algebras. Instead, we use the Clifford algebra of the split hyperbolic quadratic form of rank 8 and computations with Chevalley generators of groups of type $D_4$. Following the strategy of The Book of Involutions [KMRT], we then define the stack of trialitarian triples and show it is equivalent to the gerbe of $\mathbf{PGO}_8^+$--torsors. We show it has endomorphisms generating a group isomorphic to $\mathbb{S}_3$ and that several familiar cohomological properties of $\mathbf{PGO}_8^+$ follow in this setting as a result. Next, we define the stack of trialitarian algebras and show it is equivalent to the gerbe of $\mathbf{PGO}_8^+\rtimes \mathbb{S}_3$--torsors. Because of this, it is also equivalent to the gerbes of simply connected, respectively adjoint, groups of type $D_4$. We define $\mathbf{Spin}_\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathbf{PGO}^+_\mathcal{T}$ for a trialitarian algebra and define concrete functors $\mathcal{T} \mapsto \mathbf{Spin}_\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T} \mapsto \mathbf{PGO}^+_\mathcal{T}$ which realize these equivalences.</description>

      <title>Weierstrass semigroups and automorphism group of a maximal function field with the third largest possible genus, $q \equiv 1 \pmod 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we continue the work started in arXiv:2303.00376v1, explicitly determining the Weierstrass semigroup at any place and the full automorphism group of a known $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-maximal function field $Y_3$ having the third largest genus, for $q \equiv 1 \pmod 3$. This function field arises as a Galois subfield of the Hermitian function field, and its uniqueness (with respect to the value of its genus) is a well-known open problem. Knowing the Weierstrass semigroups may provide a key towards solving this problem. Surprisingly enough, $Y_3$ has many different types of Weierstrass semigroups and the set of its Weierstrass places is much richer than its set of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-rational places. We show that a similar exceptional behaviour does not occur in terms of automorphisms, that is, $\mathrm{Aut}(Y_3)$ is exactly the automorphism group inherited from the Hermitian function field, apart from small values of $q$.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of generalized Pl\"ucker formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Pl\"ucker numbers are defined to count certain types of tangent lines of generic degree $d$ complex projective hypersurfaces. They can be computed by identifying them as coefficients of GL(2)-equivariant cohomology classes of certain invariant subspaces, the so-called coincident root strata, of the vector space of homogeneous degree $d$ complex polynomials in two variables. In an earlier paper L\'aszl\'o M. Feh\'er and the author gave a new, recursive method for calculating these classes. Using this method, we showed that -- similarly to the classical Pl\"ucker formulas counting the bitangents and flex lines of a degree $d$ plane curve -- generalized Pl\"ucker numbers are polynomials in the degree $d$.
  In this paper, by further analyzing our recursive formula, we determine the leading terms of all the generalized Pl\"ucker formulas.</description>

      <title>Symmetry defect of $n$-dimensional complete intersections in $\mathbb{C}^{2n-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X, Y \subset \mathbb{C}^{2n-1}$ be $n$-dimensional strong complete intersections in a general position. In this note, we consider the set of midpoints of chords connecting a point $x \in X$ to a point $y \in Y$. This set is defined as the image of the map $\Phi(x,y)=\frac{x+y}{2}.$ Under geometric conditions on $X$ and $Y$, we prove that the symmetry defect of $X$ and $Y$, which is the bifurcation set $B(X,Y)$ of the mapping $\Phi$, is an algebraic variety, characterized by a topological invariant. We introduce a hypersurface that approximates the set $B(X,Y)$ and we present an estimate for its degree. Moreover, for any two $n$-dimensional strong complete intersections $X,Y\subset \mathbb{C}^{2n-1}$ (including the case $X=Y$) we introduce a generic symmetry defect set $\tilde{B}(X,Y)$ of $X$ and $Y$, which is defined up to homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Categorical Krull-Remak-Schmidt for triangulated categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring If $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are $R$-linear triangulated categories then we can give an obvious triangulated structure on $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_1 \oplus \mathcal{C}_2$ where $Hom_\mathcal{C}(U, V) = 0$ if $U \in \mathcal{C}_i$ and $V \in \mathcal{C}_j$ with $i \neq j$. We say a $R$-linear triangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ is disconnected if $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_1 \oplus \mathcal{C}_2$ where $\mathcal{C}_i$ are non-zero triangulated subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$. Let $\mathcal{C}_i$ and $\mathcal{D}_j$ be connected triangulated $R$ categories with $i \in \Gamma$ and $j \in \Lambda$. Suppose there is an equivalence of triangulated $R$-categories \[ \Phi \colon \bigoplus_{i \in \Gamma}\mathcal{C}_i \xrightarrow{\cong} \bigoplus_{j \in \Lambda}\mathcal{D}_j \] Then we show that there is a bijective function $\pi \colon \Gamma \rightarrow \Lambda$ such that we have an equivalence $\mathcal{C}_i \cong \mathcal{D}_{\pi(i)} $ for all $i \in \Gamma$. We give several examples of connected triangulated categories and also of triangulated subcategories which decompose into utmost finitely many components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.01890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I coined the term anabelomorphy (pronounced as anabel-o-morphy) as a concise way of expressing Mochizuki's idea of "anabelian way of changing ground field, rings etc." which was he has introduced in his work on his Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of this idea by studying its ramifications in the more familiar arithmetic contexts such as the theory of Galois representations, automorphic forms and related areas and establish a number of results which are of independent arithmetic interest. I also introduce the notion of anabelomorphically connected number fields in which two number fields are related by the existence of topological isomorphism between the local Galois groups at a finite list of primes of both the number fields and prove some results illustrating arithmetic consequences of this notion. The Introduction provides a detailed discussion and summary of all the results proved in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05197v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the k-forms of almost homogeneous varieties over perfect base fields k. First, we discuss criteria for the existence of k-forms in the homogeneous case. Then, we extend the Luna-Vust theory from algebraically closed fields to perfect fields to determine when a given k-form of the open orbit of an almost homogeneous variety extends to a k-form of the entire variety. Finally, in the last section, we apply these results to determine the real forms of complex almost homogeneous SL(2)-threefolds.</description>

      <title>On the singular loci of higher secant varieties of Veronese embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study singular loci of higher secant varieties of the image of the $d$-uple Veronese embedding of projective $n$-space, $v_d(\mathbb{P}^n) \subset \mathbb{P}^{N={n+d\choose d}-1}$.
  We call the closure of the union of all the $(k-1)$-planes spanned by $k$ points on $X$ the `$k$-th secant of $X$' for a given embedded variety $X \subset\mathbb{P}^N$ and denote it by $\sigma_k(X)$. For the singular loci of $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$, it has been known only for $k\le3$. As investigating geometry of moving tangents along subvarieties, we determine the (non-)singularity of so-called the `$m$-subsecant locus' of $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$, consisting of $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^m))$ with any $m$-plane $\mathbb{P}^m \subset \mathbb{P}^n$.
  These loci with arbitrary $k,d,m,n$ show an interesting trichotomy between generic smoothness, non-trivial singularity and trivial singularity. In many cases, they can be served as a new source for the singular locus of the $k$-th secant other than a trivial one, the $(k-1)$-th secant variety. We also consider the case of the $4$-th secant of $v_d(\mathbb{P}^n)$ by applying main results and computing conormal space via a certain type of Young flattening. In the end, some generalization and discussions for further development are presented as well.</description>

      <title>Jet schemes of singular surfaces of types $D_4^0$ and $D_4^1$ in characteristic $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, $S$ a variety over $k$ and m a nonnegative integer. There is a space $S_m$ over $S$ , called the jet scheme of $X$ of order $m$, parameterizing $m$-th jets on $S$. The fiber over the singular locus of $S$ is called the singular fiber. In this paper, we consider the singular fibers of the jet schemes of 2-dimensional rational double points over a field $k$ of characteristic $2$ whose resolution graph is of type $D_4$. There are two types of such singularities, of type $D_4^0$ and type $D_4^1$. We give the irreducible decomposition of the singular fiber and describe the configuration of the irreducible components. The case of a $D_4^0$-singularity is quite similar to the case of characteristic $0$ studied in [3]. The case of $D_4^1$-singularity requires more elaborate analysis of certain subsets of the singular fiber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define tropical rational function semifields $\overline{\boldsymbol{T}(X_1, \ldots, X_n)}$ and prove that a tropical curve $\varGamma$ is realized (except for points at infinity) as the congruence variety $V \subset \boldsymbol{R}^n$ associated with a congruence on $\overline{\boldsymbol{T}(X_1, \ldots, X_n)}$ by giving a specific map $\varGamma \to V$. Also, we shed light on the relation between congruences $E$ on $\overline{\boldsymbol{T}(X_1, \ldots, X_n)}$ and congruence varieties associated with them and reveal the quotient semifield $\overline{\boldsymbol{T}(X_1, \ldots, X_n)} / E$ to play the role of coordinate rings that determine isomorphism classes of affine varieties in the classical algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Local vanishing for toric varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a toric variety. We establish vanishing (and non-vanishing) results for the sheaves $R^if_*\Omega^p_{\tilde X}(\log E)$, where $f: \tilde{X} \to X$ is a strong log resolution of singularities with reduced exceptional divisor $E$. These extend the local vanishing theorem for toric varieties in [MOP20]. Our consideration of these sheaves is motivated by the notion of $k$-rational singularities introduced by Friedman and Laza [FL22b]. In particular, our results lead to criteria for toric varieties to have $k$-rational singularities, as defined in [SVV23].</description>

      <title>On the geography of $3$-folds via asymptotic behavior of invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roughly speaking, the problem of geography asks for the existence of varieties of general type after we fix some invariants. In dimension $1$, where we fix the genus, the geography question is trivial, but already in dimension $2$, it becomes a hard problem in general. In higher dimensions, this problem is essentially wide open. In this paper, we focus on geography in dimension $3$. We generalize the techniques which compare the geography of surfaces with the geography of arrangements of curves via asymptotic constructions. In dimension $2$ this involves resolutions of cyclic quotient singularities and a certain asymptotic behavior of the associated Dedekind sums and continued fractions. We discuss the general situation with emphasis on dimension $3$, analyzing the singularities and various resolutions that show up, and proving results about the asymptotic behavior of the invariants we fix.</description>

      <title>General birationality and Hyperelliptic Theta divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first state a condition ensuring that having a birational map onto the image is an open property for families of irreducible normal non uniruled varieties. We give then some criteria to ensure general birationality for a family of rational maps, via specializations.
  Among the applications is a new proof of a result obtained jointly with Luca Cesarano: that, for a general pair $(A,X)$ of an (ample) Hypersurface $X$ in an Abelian Variety $A$, the canonical map $\Phi_X$ of $X$ is birational onto its image if the polarization given by $X$ is not principal.
  The proof is also based on a careful study of the Theta divisors of the Jacobians of Hyperelliptic curves, and some related geometrical constructions. We investigate these here also in view of their beauty and of their independent interest, as they lead to a description of the rings of Hyperelliptic theta functions.</description>

      <title>The Quillen-Lichtenbaum dimension of complex varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture for smooth complex varieties states that algebraic and topological K-theory with finite coefficients become isomorphic in high degrees. We define the "Quillen-Lichtenbaum dimension" of a variety in terms of the point where this happens, show that it is surprisingly computable, and analyze many examples. It gives an obstruction to rationality, but one that turns out to be weaker than unramified cohomology and some related birational invariants defined by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Voisin using Bloch-Ogus theory. Because it is compatible with semi-orthogonal decompositions, however, it allows us to prove some new cases of the integral Hodge conjecture using homological projective duality, and to compute the higher algebraic K-theory of the Kuznetsov components of the derived categories of some Fano varieties.</description>

Abstract: We derive a formula for reconstructing a generic complex canonical curve $C$ of genus 6 and 7 in terms of the theta hyperplanes of $C$. Hence, we get a generic inverse to the Torelli map, as well as a complete description of the Schottky locus in these genera. The computational part of the proof relies on a certified numerical argument.</description>

      <title>The algebraic matroid of the Heron variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the n-th Heron variety as the realization space of the (squared) volumes of faces of an n-simplex. Our primary goal is to understand the extent to which Heron's formula, which expresses the area of a triangle as a function of its three edge lengths, can be generalized. Such a formula for one face volume of an n-simplex in terms of other face volumes expresses a dependence in the algebraic matroid of the Heron variety. Whether the volume is expressible in terms of radicals is controlled by the monodromy groups of the coordinate projections of the Heron variety onto coordinates of bases. We discuss a suite of algorithms, some new, for determining these matroids and monodromy groups. We apply these algorithms toward the smaller Heron varieties, organize our findings, and interpret the results in the context of our original motivation.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g \geq 3$, and let $G$ be a nontrivial connected reductive affine algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. Examining the moduli spaces of regularly stable $G$-Higgs bundles and holomorphic $G$-connections with a fixed topological type $d\in \pi_1(G)$ over $X$, we establish that the $k$-th homotopy groups of these two moduli spaces are isomorphic for $k \leq 2g-4$. We also prove that the mixed Hodge structures on the rational cohomology groups of these two moduli spaces are pure and isomorphic. Lastly, we explicitly describe the homotopy groups of the moduli space of $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$-connections over $X$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of monodromy coordinates for representing solutions to large polynomial systems. Representing solutions this way provides a time-memory trade-off in a monodromy solving algorithm. We describe an algorithm, which interpolates the usual monodromy solving algorithm, for computing such a representation and analyze its space and time complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <title>Recovering the Picard group of quadratic algebras from Wood's binary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13422v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a scheme such that $2$ is not a zero divisor. In this paper, we address the following question: given a quadratic algebra over $S$, how can we parametrize its Picard group in terms of quadratic forms? In 2011, Wood established a set-theoretical bijection between isomorphism classes of primary binary quadratic forms over $S$ and isomorphism classes of pairs $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{M})$ where $\mathcal{C}$ is a quadratic algebra over $S$ and $\mathcal{M}$ is an invertible $\mathcal{C}$-module. Unexpectedly, examples suggest that a refinement of Wood's bijection is needed in order to parametrize Picard groups. This is why we start by classifying quadratic algebras over $S$; this is achieved by using two invariants, the discriminant and the parity. Extending the notion of orientation of quadratic algebras to the non-free case is another key step, eventually leading us to the desired parametrization. All along the paper, we illustrate various notions and obstructions with a wide range of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of twisted K\"ahler-Einstein metrics in big cohomology classes, using a divisorial stability condition. In particular, when $-K_X$ is big, we obtain a uniform Yau-Tian-Donaldson existence theorem for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics. To achieve this, we build up from scratch the theory of Fujita-Odaka type delta invariants in the transcendental big setting, using pluripotential theory. We do not use the K-energy in our arguments, and our techniques provide a simple roadmap to prove Yau-Tian-Donaldson existence theorems for K\"ahler-Einstein type metrics, that only needs convexity of the appropriate Ding energy. As an application, we give a simplified proof of Li-Tian-Wang's existence theorem in the log Fano setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genus Theory is a classical feature of integral binary quadratic forms. Using the author's generalization of the well-known correspondence between quadratic form classes and ideal classes of quadratic algebras, we extend it to the case when quadratic forms are twisted and have coefficients in any PID $R$. When ${R = \mathbb{K}[X]}$, we show that the Genus Theory map is the quadratic form version of the $2$-descent map on a certain hyperelliptic curve. As an application, we make a contribution to a question of Agboola and Pappas regarding a specialization problem of divisor classes on hyperelliptic curves. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the set of non-trivial specializations has density $1$.</description>
