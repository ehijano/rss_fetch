      <title>Codes in algebras of direct products of groups and associated quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the Wedderburn-Artin decomposition of a semisimple group algebra associated to a direct product of finite groups. We also provide formulae for the number of all possible group codes, and their dimensions, that can be constructed in a group algebra. As particular cases, we present the complete algebraic description of the group algebra of any direct product of groups whose direct factors are cyclic, dihedral, or generalised quaternion groups. Finally, in the specific case of semisimple dihedral group algebras, we give a method to build quantum error-correcting codes, based on the CSS construction.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Classification-Based Spectrum Sensing Using Support Vector Machine for CRN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for internet of things (IoT) and device-to-device (D2D) applications in next generation communication systems increases, we are confronted with a challenge of spectrum scarcity. One promising solution to this problem is cognitive radio network (CRN), where the key element is the spectrum - a valuable and sharable natural resource that should not be wasted. To design efficient and sustainable networks for the future, it is crucial to ensure that spectrum sensing is not only accurate and rapid, but also energy-efficient. Spectrum sensing is a critical aspect of CRNs, and this study is mainly focused on it. In this research, we employ the supervised machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), to detect primary users (PU). We investigate different variants of SVM, including linear, polynomial, and Gaussian radial basic function (RBF), and employ an ensemble classification-based approach to improve the classifier's performance and productivity. The simulation results demonstrate that the ensemble classifier achieves the highest performance.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Constacyclic Codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$-constacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of area $M N$, where $q$ is some power of prime $p$ with $\gcd(M,p)=1$ and $\gcd(N,p)=1$. With the help of common zero (CZ) set, we characterize 2-D constacyclic codes. Further, we provide an algorithm to construct an ideal basis of these codes by using their essential common zero (ECZ) sets. We describe the dual of 2-D constacyclic codes. Finally, we provide an encoding scheme for generating 2-D constacyclic codes. We present an example to illustrate that 2-D constacyclic codes can have better minimum distance compared to their cyclic counterparts with the same code size and code rate.</description>

      <title>On Eisenstein additive codes over chain rings and linear codes over mixed alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{R}_e=GR(p^e,r)[y]/\langle g(y),p^{e-1}y^t\rangle$ be a finite commutative chain ring, where $p$ is a prime number, $GR(p^e,r)$ is the Galois ring of characteristic $p^e$ and rank $r,$ $t$ and $k$ are positive integers satisfying $1\leq t\leq k$ when $e \geq 2,$ while $t=k$ when $e=1,$ and $g(y)=y^k+p(g_{k-1}y^{k-1}+\cdots+g_1y+g_0)\in GR(p^e,r)[y]$ is an Eisenstein polynomial with $g_0$ as a unit in $GR(p^e,r).$ In this paper, we first establish a duality-preserving 1-1 correspondence between additive codes over $\mathcal{R}_e$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p^e}\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e-1}}$-linear codes, where the character-theoretic dual codes of additive codes over $\mathcal{R}_e$ correspond to the Euclidean dual codes of $\mathbb{Z}_{p^e}\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e-1}}$-linear codes, and vice versa. This correspondence gives rise to a method for constructing additive codes over $\mathcal{R}_e$ and their character-theoretic dual codes, as unlike additive codes over $\mathcal{R}_e,$ $\mathbb{Z}_{p^e}\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e-1}}$-linear codes can be completely described in terms of generator matrices. We also list additive codes over the chain ring $\mathbb{Z}_4[y]/\langle y^2-2,2y \rangle$ achieving the Plotkin's bound for homogeneous weights, which suggests that additive codes over $\mathcal{R}_e$ is a promising class of error-correcting codes to find optimal codes with respect to the homogeneous metric.</description>

      <title>On Galois LCD codes and LCPs of codes over mixed alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathtt{R}$ be a finite commutative chain ring with the maximal ideal $\gamma\mathtt{R}$ of nilpotency index $e\geq 2,$ and let $\check{\mathtt{R}}=\mathtt{R}/\gamma^{s}\mathtt{R}$ for some positive integer $ s&lt; e.$ In this paper, we study and characterize Galois $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-LCD codes of an arbitrary block-length. We show that each weakly-free $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-linear code is monomially equivalent to a Galois $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-LCD code when $|\mathtt{R}/\gamma\mathtt{R}|&gt;4,$ while it is monomially equivalent to a Euclidean $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-LCD code when $|\mathtt{R}/\gamma\mathtt{R}|&gt;3.$ We also obtain enumeration formulae for all Euclidean and Hermitian $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-LCD codes of an arbitrary block-length. With the help of these enumeration formulae, we classify all Euclidean $\mathbb{Z}_4 \mathbb{Z}_{2}$-LCD codes and $\mathbb{Z}_9 \mathbb{Z}_{3}$-LCD codes of block-lengths $(1,1),$ $(1,2),$ $(2,1),$ $(2,2),$ $(3,1)$ and $(3,2)$ and all Hermitian $\frac{\mathbb{F}_{4}[u]}{\langle u^2\rangle} \;\mathbb{F}_{4}$-LCD codes of block-lengths $(1,1),$ $(1,2),$ $(2,1)$ and $(2,2)$ up to monomial equivalence. Apart from this, we study and characterize LCPs of $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-linear codes. We further study a direct sum masking scheme constructed using LCPs of $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-linear codes and obtain its security threshold against fault injection and side-channel attacks. We also discuss another application of LCPs of $\mathtt{R}\check{\mathtt{R}}$-linear codes in coding for the noiseless two-user adder channel.</description>

      <title>DNA codes from $(\text{\textbaro}, \mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$-constacyclic codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4+\omega\mathbb{Z}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to constructing DNA codes from linear codes over a non-chain extension of $\mathbb{Z}_4$. We study $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring $\mathfrak{R}=\mathbb{Z}_4+\omega\mathbb{Z}_4, \omega^2=\omega,$ with an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism $\text{\textbaro}$ and a $\text{\textbaro}$-derivation $\mathfrak{d}$ over $\mathfrak{R}.$ Further, we determine the generators of the $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring $\mathfrak{R}$ of any arbitrary length and establish the reverse constraint for these codes. Besides the necessary and sufficient criterion to derive reverse-complement codes, we present a construction to obtain DNA codes from these reversible codes. Moreover, we use another construction on the $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d},\gamma)$-constacyclic codes to generate additional optimal and new classical codes. Finally, we provide several examples of $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$ constacyclic codes and construct DNA codes from established results. The parameters of these linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ are better and optimal according to the codes available at \cite{z4codes}.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptive Real-Time Beamforming Design for Dynamic Environments in Cell-Free Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider real-time beamforming design for dynamic wireless environments with varying channels and different numbers of access points (APs) and users in cell-free systems. Specifically, a sum-rate maximization optimization problem is formulated for the beamforming design in dynamic wireless environments of cell-free systems. To efficiently solve it, a high-generalization network (HGNet) is proposed to adapt to the changing numbers of APs and users. Then, a high-generalization beamforming module is also designed in HGNet to extract the valuable features for the varying channels, and we theoretically prove that such a high-generalization beamforming module is able to reduce the upper bound of the generalization error. Subsequently, by online adaptively updating about 3% of the parameters of HGNet, an online adaptive updating (OAU) algorithm is proposed to enable the online adaptive real-time beamforming design for improving the sum rate. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed HGNet with OAU algorithm achieves a higher sum rate with a lower computational cost on the order of milliseconds, thus realizing the real-time beamforming design for dynamic wireless environments in cell-free systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel waveletbased algorithm for reconstructing time-domain impulse responses from band-limited scattering parameters (frequencydomain data) with a particular focus on ship hull applications. We establish the algorithm and demonstrate its convergence, as well as its efficiency for a class of functions that can be expanded as exponential functions.

      <title>AI and Deep Learning for THz Ultra-Massive MIMO: From Model-Driven Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address the challenges posed by terahertz ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (THz UM-MIMO) systems. We begin by outlining the characteristics of THz UM-MIMO systems, and identify three primary challenges for the transceiver design: 'hard to compute', 'hard to model', and 'hard to measure'. We argue that AI can provide a promising solution to these challenges. We then propose two systematic research roadmaps for developing AI algorithms tailored for THz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, called model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance to leverage available domain knowledge and advocates for adopting AI only to enhance the bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. We discuss four essential steps to make it work, including algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss function design, and neural architecture design. Afterwards, we present a forward-looking vision through the second roadmap, i.e., physical layer foundation models. This approach seeks to unify the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their common foundation, i.e., the wireless channel. We propose to train a single, compact foundation model to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which can serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. We will also guide the readers through four essential steps, including general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, and the joint design of foundation models and model-driven DL.</description>

      <title>Dual-Zone Hard-Core Model for RTS/CTS Handshake Analysis in WLANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new stochastic geometry-based model to analyze the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) handshake mechanism in wireless local area networks (WLANs). We develop an advanced hard-core point process model, termed the dual-zone hard-core process (DZHCP), which extends traditional hard-core models to capture the spatial interactions and exclusion effects introduced by the RTS/CTS mechanism. This model integrates key parameters accounting for the thinning effects imposed by RTS/CTS, enabling a refined characterization of active transmitters in the network. Analytical expressions are derived for the intensity of the DZHCP, the mean interference, and an approximation of the success probability, providing insight into how network performance depends on critical design parameters. Our results provide better estimates of interference levels and success probability, which could inform strategies for better interference management and improved performance in future WLAN designs.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Out-of-Distribution Generalization with Applications to Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization in machine learning and propose a general framework that establishes information-theoretic generalization bounds. Our framework interpolates freely between Integral Probability Metric (IPM) and $f$-divergence, which naturally recovers some known results (including Wasserstein- and KL-bounds), as well as yields new generalization bounds. Additionally, we show that our framework admits an optimal transport interpretation. When evaluated in two concrete examples, the proposed bounds either strictly improve upon existing bounds in some cases or match the best existing OOD generalization bounds. Moreover, by focusing on $f$-divergence and combining it with the Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) methods, we derive a family of CMI-based generalization bounds, which include the state-of-the-art ICIMI bound as a special instance. Finally, leveraging these findings, we analyze the generalization of the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm, showing that our derived generalization bounds outperform existing information-theoretic generalization bounds in certain scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) and near maximum distance separable (NMDS) codes have been widely used in various fields such as communication systems, data storage, and quantum codes due to their algebraic properties and excellent error-correcting capabilities. This paper focuses on a specific class of linear codes and establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be MDS or NMDS. Additionally, we employ the well-known Schur method to demonstrate that they are non-equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon codes.</description>
