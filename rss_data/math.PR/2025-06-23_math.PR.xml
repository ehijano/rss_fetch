      <title>The extinction of the contact process in a one-dimensional random environment with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the contact process on the long-range percolation cluster on $\mathbb{Z}$ where each edge $\langle i,j \rangle$ is open with probability $|i-j|^{-s}$ for $s&gt; 2$. Using a renormalization procedure we apply Peierls-type argument to prove that the contact process dies out if the transmission rate is smaller than a critical threshold. Our methods involve the control of crossing probabilities for percolation on randomly-stretched lattices as in https://doi.org/10.1214/22-AAP1887.</description>

      <title>The coalescent of a sample from a linear-fractional branching process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson processes with linear-fractional offspring distributions. At a fixed generation, we consider a sample of the individuals alive, drawn in two different ways: either through Bernoulli sampling, where each individual is selected independently with a given probability, or through uniform sampling, where a fixed number of individuals are chosen uniformly at random. We analyze the genealogical trees generated by the sampled individuals. In particular, we establish a relationship between the distributions of the trees resulting from the two sampling schemes.</description>

      <title>The Bivariate regular variation of randomly weighted sums revisited in the presence of interdependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the closure properties of the class of Bivariate Regular Variation, symbolically BRV , in standard and nonstandard cases, with respect to the randomly weighted sums. However, we take into consideration a weak dependence structure among the random weights and the main random variables, providing more flexibility in applications. In the first main result, under the condition that the main random variables belong to BRV , we provide a dependent bivariate extension of Breiman's theorem, under some sufficient conditions. Furthermore, we continue the extension into randomly weighted sums. The main target motivation of this work is stochastic modeling of regular variation under the condition of economic instability. For this reason we provide the ruin probability estimation over finite time horizon in a two dimensional discrete time risk model, with interdependence among the insurance and financial risks, as also the asymptotic behavior of a risk measure, known as joint expected shortfall.</description>

      <title>Greedy Selection under Independent Increments: A Toy Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an iterative selection problem over N i.i.d. discrete-time stochastic processes with independent increments. At each stage, a fixed number of processes are retained based on their observed values. Under this simple model, we prove that the optimal strategy for selecting the final maximum-value process is to apply greedy selection at each stage. While the result relies on strong independence assumptions, it offers a clean justification for greedy heuristics in multi-stage elimination settings and may serve as a toy example for understanding related algorithms in high-dimensional applications.</description>

      <title>The exact recovery with sub-exponential measurement matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ random matrix, where each entry is an i.i.d.sub-exponential random variable with mean 0 and variance $\frac{1}{m^2}$. We demonstrate that, with high probability, the sub-exponential matrix $A$ can be used for the exact reconstruction of $s$-sparse vectors via $\ell_1$-minimization, provided that $m \ge C_1 s \log\left(\frac{C_2 n}{s}\right)$. This improves upon the existing results by Adamczak et al.</description>

      <title>Reduced critical branching processes in non-favorable random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\left\{ Z_{n},n=0,1,2,...\right\} $ be a critical branching process in i.i.d. random environment, $Z_{r,n}$ be the number of particles in the process at moment $0\leq r\leq n-1$ that have a positive number of descendants in generation $n$, and $\left\{ S_{n},n=0,1,2,...\right\} $ be the associated random walk of $\left\{ Z_{n},n=0,1,2,...\right\} $. It is known that if the increments of the associated random walk have zero mean and finite variance $\sigma ^{2}$ then, for any $t\in \lbrack 0,1]$ \begin{equation*} \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathbf{P}\left( \frac{\log Z_{\left[ nt\right] ,n}}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}\leq x\Big|Z_{n}&gt;0\right) =\mathbf{P}\left( \min_{t\leq s\leq 1}B_{s}^{+}\leq x\right) ,\;x\in \lbrack 0,\infty ), \end{equation*} where $\left\{ B_{t}^{+},0\leq t\leq 1\right\} $ is the Brownian meander. We supplement this result by description of the distribution of the properly scaled random variable $\log Z_{r,n}$ under the condition $\left\{ S_{n}\leq t\sqrt{k},Z_{n}&gt;0\right\} ,$ where $t&gt;0$ and $r,k\rightarrow \infty $ in such a way that $k=o(n)$ as $n\to\infty$.
  The case when the distribution of the increments of the associated random walk belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law is also considered.</description>

      <title>Throughput in inhomogeneous planar drainage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider navigation schemes on planar diluted lattices and semi lattices with one discrete and one continuous component. More precisely, nodes that survive inhomogeneous Bernoulli site percolation, or are placed as inhomogeneous Poisson points on shifted copies of $\mathbb{Z}$, forward their individually generated traffic to their respective closest neighbors to the left in the next layer. The resulting drainage network is a tree and we study the amount of traffic that goes through an increasing window at the origin. Our main results show that, properly rescaled, the total traffic, jointly with the total length of the contributing tree part, converges to the area under a time-inhomogeneous Brownian motion until it hits zero. The hitting time corresponds to the limiting maximal path length.</description>

      <title>Cartan's Path Development, the Logarithmic Signature and a Conjecture of Lyons-Sidorova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature transform, which is defined in terms of iterated path integrals of all orders, provides a faithful representation of the group of tree-reduced geometric rough paths. While the signature coefficients are known to decay factorially fast, the coefficients of the logarithimic signature generically only possess geometric decay. It was conjectured by T. Lyons and N. Sidorova that the only tree-reduced paths with bounded variation (BV) whose logarithmic signature can have infinite radius of convergence are straight lines. This conjecture was confirmed in the same work for certain types of paths and the general BV case remains unsolved.
  The aim of the present article is to develop a deeper understanding towards the Lyons-Sidorova conjecture. We prove that, if the logarithmic signature has infinite radius of convergence, the signature coefficients must satisfy an infinite system of rigid algebraic identities defined in terms of iterated integrals along complex exponential one-forms. These iterated integral identities impose strong geometric constraints on the underlying path, and in some special situations, confirm the conjecture.
  As a non-trivial application of our integral identities, we prove a strengthened version of the conjecture, which asserts that if the logarithmic signature of a BV path has infinite radius of convergence over all sub-intervals of time, the underlying path must be a straight line.
  Our methodology relies on Cartan's path development onto the complex semisimple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{sl}_m(\mathbb{C})$. The special root patterns of $\mathfrak{sl}_m(\mathbb{C})$ allow one to project the infinite-dimensional Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula in a very special finite dimensional manner to yield meaningful quantitative relations between BCH-type singularities and the vanishing of certain iterated path integrals.</description>

      <title>A stochastic model for the diffusion of competing opinions with trend-following, opposition, and indifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model for the diffusion of competing opinions in a population composed of three types of agents: trend-followers, opposers, and indifferent individuals. The decision dynamics are driven by reinforcement mechanisms, modulated by a latent trend process, allowing us to capture realistic features such as amplification, resistance, and randomness in opinion formation. We derive explicit formulas for the finite-time moments of the opinion count vector and establish a set of strong asymptotic results, including laws of large numbers, central limit theorems, laws of the iterated logarithm, and almost sure convergence of empirical distributions. In particular, we show how early fluctuations can persist or vanish depending on the balance between reinforcement and opposition. Our analysis relies on martingale techniques and offers closed-form expressions for key quantities, providing both theoretical insights and tools for simulations or applications in social dynamics, marketing, or information diffusion.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic approximation of fully nonlinear second-order PIDEs with convergence rates for the universal robust limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a probabilistic approximation scheme for a class of nonstandard, fully nonlinear second-order partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) arising from nonlinear L\'evy processes under Peng's G-expectation framework. The PIDE involves a supremum over a set of \(\alpha\)-stable L\'evy measures, potentially with degenerate diffusion and a non-separable uncertainty set, which renders existing numerical results inapplicable. We construct a recursive, piecewise-constant approximation to the viscosity solution and derive explicit error bounds. A key application of our analysis is the quantification of convergence rates for the universal robust limit theorem under sublinear expectations, unifying Peng's robust central limit theorem, laws of large numbers, and the \(\alpha\)-stable limit theorem of Bayraktar and Munk, with explicit Berry--Esseen-type bounds.</description>

      <title>Complete left tail asymptotic for branching processes in random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the complete left tail asymptotic for the density of the {\it martingale limit} of the classical Galton-Watson process has been derived. The derivation is based on the properties of a special function (whose inverse Fourier transform is the density) satisfying a Poincar\'e-type functional equation. However, the corresponding special function does not satisfy the Poincar\'e-type functional equation for the processes in random environments. This makes it impossible to apply the developed asymptotic methods. In this instance, even computing the special function and the density becomes extremely challenging. We propose a method that extracts the terms of the asymptotic series from another limit distribution {\it ratios of probabilities of rare events}. The generating functions for this limit distribution satisfy the generalized Schr\"oder-type functional equations that greatly simplify the calculations. As in the classical case of constant environments, the obtained series converges everywhere. Possible interesting connections with exotic fractal measures that Robert Strichartz considers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Averaging principles for time-inhomogeneous multi-scale SDEs with partially dissipative coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study averaging principles for a class of time-inhomogeneous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with slow and fast time-scales, where the drift term in the fast component is time-dependent and only partially dissipative. Under asymptotic assumptions on the coefficients, we prove that the slow component $(X^{\varepsilon}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ converges strongly to the unique solution $(\bar{X}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ to an averaged SDE, when the diffusion coefficient in the slow component is independent of the fast component; on the other hand, we establish the weak convergence of $(X_t^{\varepsilon})_{t\ge0}$ in the space $C([0,T];\mathbb{R}^n)$ and identify the limiting process by the martingale problem approach, when the diffusion coefficient of the slow component depends on the fast component. The proofs of strong and weak averaging principles are partly based on the study of the existence and uniqueness of an evolution system of measures for time-inhomogeneous SDEs with partially dissipative drift.</description>

We first present a mathematical proof before exposing the difficulties which arise when trying to formalize it, and how they were overcome. We then build on this work to formalize the construction of the product of an arbitrary family of probability measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hard-core probabilistic cellular automaton has attracted a renewed interest in the last few years, thanks to its connection with the study of a combinatorial game on percolation configurations. We provide an alternative proof for the ergodicity of this PCA for a neighbourhood of size $2$ and $3$, using the notion of decorrelated islands introduced by Casse in 2023, together with some new ideas. This shortens the previous proofs and provides a more intuitive and unified approach.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of Gaussian and Laguerre Ensembles at the Soft Edge III: Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conclude our work [arXiv:2403.07628, arXiv:2503.12644] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles, now studying the gap-probability generating functions. We show that the correction terms in the asymptotic expansion are multilinear forms of the higher-order derivatives of the leading-order term, with certain rational polynomial coefficients that are independent of the dummy variable. In this way, the same multilinear structure, with the same polynomial coefficients, is inherited by the asymptotic expansion of any linearly induced quantity such as the distribution of the $k$-th largest level. Whereas the results for the unitary ensembles are presented with proof, the discussion of the orthogonal and symplectic ones is based on some hypotheses. To substantiate the hypotheses, we check the result for the $k$-th largest level in the orthogonal ensembles against simulation data for choices of $n$ and $k$ that require as many as four correction terms to achieve satisfactory accuracy.</description>

      <title>Random walk reflected off of infinity, with applications to uniform spanning forests and supercritical Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G$ be an infinite graph -- not necessarily one-ended -- on which the simple random walk is transient. We define a variant of the continuous-time random walk on $\mathcal G$ which reaches $\infty$ in finite time and "reflects off of $\infty$" infinitely many times.
  We show that the Aldous-Broder algorithm for the random walk reflected off of $\infty$ gives the free uniform spanning forest (FUSF) on $\mathcal G$. Furthermore, Wilson's algorithm for the random walk reflected off of $\infty$ gives the FUSF on $\mathcal G$ on the event that the FUSF is connected, but not in general.
  We also apply the theory of random walk reflected off of $\infty$ to study random planar maps in the universality class of supercritical Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), equivalently LQG with central charge in $(1,25)$. Such random planar maps are infinite, with uncountably many ends. We define a version of the Tutte embedding for such maps under which they conjecturally converge to LQG. We also make several conjectures regarding the qualitative behavior of stochastic processes on such maps -- including the FUSF and critical percolation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes and Reproducing Kernels: Connections and Equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph studies the relations between two approaches using positive definite kernels: probabilistic methods using Gaussian processes, and non-probabilistic methods using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). They are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration, distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are developed in parallel by the two research communities.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequalities and universal approximators for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Poincar\'e inequalities are indispensable tools in the study of dimension reduction and low-distortion embeddings of graphs into metric spaces, and have found remarkable algorithmic applications. A basic open problem, posed by Jon Kleinberg (2013), asks whether the optimal nonlinear Poincar\'e constant for maps between two independent $3$-regular random graphs is dimension-free, i.e., independent of vertex-set sizes. We give a complete and affirmative resolution to Kleinberg's problem, also allowing for arbitrary graph degrees. As a corollary, we obtain a stochastic construction of $O(1)\text{-universal}$ approximators for random graphs, answering a question of Mendel and Naor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Zeta Tail(a) probability distribution as a new model for random damage-event counts in risk analysis. Although readily motivated through a natural relationship with the Geometric(p) distribution, Zeta Tail(a) has received little attention in the scholarly literature. In the present work, we begin by deriving various fundamental properties of this novel distribution. We then assess its usefulness as an alternative to Geometric(p) for event-count data.</description>

      <title>Detection and Reconstruction of a Random Hypergraph from Noisy Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included i.i.d.\ so that the average degree in the hypergraph is $n^{\delta+o(1)}$, the projection of such a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to a same hyperedge. In this work, we study the inference problem where the observation is a \emph{noisy} version of the graph projection where each edge in the projection is kept with probability $p=n^{-1+\alpha+o(1)}$ and each edge not in the projection is added with probability $q=n^{-1+\beta+o(1)}$. For all constant $d$, we establish sharp thresholds for both detection (distinguishing the noisy projection from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge density $q$) and reconstruction (estimating the original hypergraph). Notably, our results reveal a \emph{detection-reconstruction gap} phenomenon in this problem. Our work also answers a problem raised in \cite{BGPY25+}.</description>

      <title>Stochastic stability of physical measures in conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the significance of physical measures in understanding the complexity of dynamical systems as well as the noisy nature of real-world systems, investigating the stability of physical measures under noise perturbations is undoubtedly a fundamental issue in both theory and practice.
  The present paper is devoted to the stochastic stability of physical measures for conservative systems on a smooth, connected, and closed Riemannian manifold. It is assumed that a conservative system admits an invariant measure with a positive and mildly regular density. Our findings affirm, in particular, that such an invariant measure has strong stochastic stability whenever it is physical, that is, for a large class of small random perturbations, the density of this invariant measure is the zero-noise limit in $L^{1}$ of the densities of unique stationary measures of corresponding randomly perturbed systems. Stochastic stability in a stronger sense is obtained under additional assumptions. Examples are constructed to demonstrate that stochastic stability could occur even if the invariant measure is non-physical. The high non-triviality of constructing such examples asserts the sharpness of the stochastic stability conclusion. Similar results are established for conservative systems on bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms using Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling - common challenges in real-world time series and graph data.
  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency, bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling; the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context length.
  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.</description>

      <title>Semirandom Planted Clique via 1-norm Isometry Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a planted clique of size $k \ge \sqrt{n \log n}$ in the semirandom model, improving the state-of-the-art $\sqrt{n} (\log n)^2$ bound. This $\textit{semirandom planted clique problem}$ concerns finding the planted subset $S$ of $k$ vertices of a graph $G$ on $V$, where the induced subgraph $G[S]$ is complete, the cut edges in $G[S; V \setminus S]$ are random, and the remaining edges in $G[V \setminus S]$ are adversarial.
  An elegant greedy algorithm by Blasiok, Buhai, Kothari, and Steurer [BBK24] finds $S$ by sampling inner products of the columns of the adjacency matrix of $G$, and checking if they deviate significantly from typical inner products of random vectors. Their analysis uses a suitably random matrix that, with high probability, satisfies a certain restricted isometry property. Inspired by Wootters's work on list decoding, we put forth and implement the $1$-norm analog of this argument, and quantitatively improve their analysis to work all the way up to the conjectured optimal $\sqrt{n \log n}$ bound on clique size, answering one of the main open questions posed in [BBK24].</description>

      <title>h-calibration: Rethinking Classifier Recalibration with Probabilistic Error-Bounded Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods, binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration. Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.</description>

      <title>On polluted bootstrap percolation in Cartesian grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and assuming that some vertices of $G$ are infected, the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule makes an uninfected vertex $v$ infected if $v$ has at least $r$ infected neighbors. The $r$-percolation number, $m(G, r)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set of initially infected vertices in $G$ such that after continuously performing the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule each vertex of $G$ eventually becomes infected. In this paper, we continue the study of polluted bootstrap percolation introduced and studied by Gravner and McDonald [Bootstrap percolation in a polluted environment. J.\ Stat\ Physics 87 (1997) 915--927] where in this variant some vertices are permanently in the non-infected state. We study an extremal (combinatorial) version of the bootstrap percolation problem in a polluted environment, where our main focus is on the class of grid graphs, that is, the Cartesian product $P_m \square P_n$ of two paths $P_m$ and $P_n$ on $m$ and $n$ vertices, respectively. Given a number of polluted vertices in a Cartesian grid we establish a closed formula for the minimum $2$-neighbor bootstrap percolation number of the polluted grid, and obtain a lower bound for the other extreme.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>

      <title>Dynamical covering sets in self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the size of \emph{dynamical covering sets} on a self-similar set. Dynamical covering sets are limsup sets generated by placing shrinking target sets around points along an orbit in a dynamical system. In the case when the target sets are balls with sizes depending on the centre, we determine the size of the dynamical covering set as a function of the shrinking rate. In particular, we find sharp conditions guaranteeing when full Dvoretzky-type covering, and full measure occur. We also compute the Hausdorff dimension in the remaining cases. The proofs apply in the cases of targets centred at typical points of the self-similar set, with respect to any Bernoulli measure on it. Unlike in existing work on dynamical coverings, and despite the dimension value featuring phase transitions, we demonstrate that the behaviour can be characterised by a single pressure function over the full range of parameters. The techniques are a combination of classical dimension theoretical estimates and intricate martingale arguments.</description>

      <title>Regularity of random attractor and fractal dimension of fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations on three-dimensional torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we will study the asymptotic dynamics of fractional Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with additive white noise on three-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^3$. Under the conditions that the external forces $f(x)$ belong to the phase space $ H$ and the noise intensity function $h(x)$ satisfies $\|\nabla h\|_{L^\infty} &lt; \sqrt \pi \nu \lambda_1^\frac{5}{4}$, where $ \nu $ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and $\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue of the Stokes operator, we shown that the random fractional three-dimensional NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^\frac{5}{2})$-random attractor whose fractal dimension in $H^\frac{5}{2}$ is finite. This was proved by establishing, first, an $H^\frac{5}{2}$ bounded absorbing set and, second, a local $(H,H^\frac{5}{2})$-Lipschitz continuity in initial values from which the $(H,H^\frac{5}{2})$-asymptotic compactness of the system follows. Since the forces $f$ belong only to $H$, the $H^\frac{5}{2}$ bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of estimating the $H^\frac{5}{2}$-distance between the solutions of the random fractional three-dimensional NS equations and that of the corresponding deterministic equations. Furthermore, under the conditions that the external forces $f(x)$ belong to the $ H^{k-\frac{5}{4}}$ and the noise intensity function $h(x)$ belong to $H^{k+\frac{5}{4}}$ for $k\geq\frac{5}{2}$, we shown that the random fractional three-dimensional NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^k)$-random attractor whose fractal dimension in $H^k$ is finite. This was proved by using iterative methods and establishing, first, an $H^k$ bounded absorbing set and, second, a local $(H,H^k)$-Lipschitz continuity in initial values from which the $(H,H^k)$-asymptotic compactness of the system follows.</description>

      <title>Improved geometric and recollision estimates for the invariance principle of the random Lorentz gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By improving geometric recollision estimates for a random Lorentz gas, we extend the timescale $T(r)$ of the invariance principle for a Lorentz gas with particle size $r$ obtained by Lutsko and Toth (2020) from $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)|^2 =0$ to $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)| =0$. We show that this is the maximal reachable timescale with the coupling of stochastic processes introduced in the original result. In our improved geometric estimates we make use of the convexity of scatterers to obtain better dispersive estimates for the associated billiard map. We provide additional estimates which potentially open the possibility to reach, with a more elaborate coupling argument, up to timescales just below of $T(r)\sim r^{-2}$ when recollision patterns of arbitrary length occur.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity and well-posedness of physical solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regularity and well-posedness of physical solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem. Assuming only that the initial temperature is integrable, we prove that the free boundary, known to have jump discontinuities as a function of the time variable, is $C^1$ as a function of the space variable, and is $C^{\infty}$ outside of a closed, countable set, which we describe explicitly. We also prove that, as conjectured in arXiv:1902.05174, the set of positive times when a jump occurs cannot have accumulation points. In addition, we prove that short-time uniqueness of physical solutions implies global uniqueness, which allows us to obtain uniqueness for very general initial data that fall outside the scope of the current well-posedness regime. In particular, we answer two questions left open in arXiv:1811.12356, arXiv:2302.13097, regarding the global uniqueness of solutions. We proceed by deriving a weighted obstacle problem satisfied by the solutions, which we exploit to establish regularity and non-degeneracy estimates and to classify the free boundary points. We also establish a backward propagation of oscillation property, which allows us to control the occurrence of future jumps in terms of the past oscillation of the solution.</description>

      <title>The Within-Orbit Adaptive Leapfrog No-U-Turn Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locally adapting parameters within Markov chain Monte Carlo methods while preserving reversibility is notoriously difficult. The success of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) largely stems from its clever local adaptation of the integration time in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via a geometric U-turn condition. However, posterior distributions frequently exhibit multi-scale geometries with extreme variations in scale, making it necessary to also adapt the leapfrog integrator's step size locally and dynamically. Despite its practical importance, this problem has remained largely open since the introduction of NUTS by Hoffman and Gelman (2014). To address this issue, we introduce the Within-orbit Adaptive Leapfrog No-U-Turn Sampler (WALNUTS), a generalization of NUTS that adapts the leapfrog step size at fixed intervals of simulated time as the orbit evolves. At each interval, the algorithm selects the largest step size from a dyadic schedule that keeps the energy error below a user-specified threshold. Like NUTS, WALNUTS employs biased progressive state selection to favor states with positions that are further from the initial point along the orbit. Empirical evaluations on multiscale target distributions, including Neal's funnel and the Stock-Watson stochastic volatility time-series model, demonstrate that WALNUTS achieves substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness compared to standard NUTS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by allocation strategies in multi-armed bandit model, we propose a pathwise construction of Walsh spider diffusions. For any infinitesimal generator on a star shaped graph, there exists a unique time change associated with a multi-parameter process such that the time change of this multi-parameter process is the desired diffusion. The time change has an interpretation of time allocation of the process on each edge, and it can be derived explicitly from a family of equations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Voting Models with Varying Speeds of Correlation Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model voting behaviour in the multi-group setting of a two-tier voting system using sequences of de Finetti measures. Our model is defined by using the de Finetti representation of a probability measure (i.e. as a mixture of conditionally independent probability measures) describing voting behaviour. The de Finetti measure describes the interaction between voters and possible outside influences on them. We assume that for each population size there is a (potentially) different de Finetti measure, and as the population grows, the sequence of de Finetti measures converges weakly to the Dirac measure at the origin, representing a tendency toward weakening social cohesion as the population grows large. The resulting model covers a wide variety of behaviour, ranging from independent voting in the limit under fast convergence, a critical convergence speed with its own pattern of behaviour, to a subcritical convergence speed which yields a model in line with empirical evidence of real-world voting data, contrary to previous probabilistic models used in the study of voting. These models can be used, e.g., to study the problem of optimal voting weights in two-tier voting systems.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for 1-independent percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 1-independent bond percolation model on a graph $G$ is a probability distribution on the spanning subgraphs of $G$ in which, for all vertex-disjoint sets of edges $S_1$ and $S_2$, the states of the edges in $S_1$ are independent of the states of the edges in $S_2$. Such a model is said to percolate if the random subgraph has an infinite component with positive probability. In 2012 the first author and Bollob\'as defined $p_{\max}(G)$ to be the supremum of those $p$ for which there exists a 1-independent bond percolation model on $G$ in which each edge is present in the random subgraph with probability at least $p$ but which does not percolate.
  A fundamental and challenging problem in this area is to determine the value of $p_{\max}(G)$ when $G$ is the lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Since $p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^n)\leq p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^{n-1})$, it is also of interest to establish the value of $\lim_{n\to\infty} p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$. In this paper we significantly improve the best known upper bound on this limit and obtain better upper and lower bounds on $p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^2)$. In proving these results, we also give an upper bound on the critical probability for a 1-independent model on the hypercube graph to contain a giant component asymptotically almost surely.</description>

      <title>Colored Interacting Particle Systems on the Ring: Stationary Measures from Yang-Baxter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been much progress in understanding stationary measures for colored (also called multi-species or multi-type) interacting particle systems, motivated by asymptotic phenomena and rich underlying algebraic and combinatorial structures (such as nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials).
  In this paper, we present a unified approach to constructing stationary measures for most of the known colored particle systems on the ring and the line, including (1) the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (multispecies ASEP, or mASEP); (2) the q-deformed Totally Asymmetric Zero Range Process (TAZRP) also known as the q-Boson particle system; (3) the q-deformed Pushing Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (q-PushTASEP). Our method is based on integrable stochastic vertex models and the Yang-Baxter equation. We express the stationary measures as partition functions of new "queue vertex models" on the cylinder. The stationarity property is a direct consequence of the Yang-Baxter equation.
  For the mASEP on the ring, a particular case of our vertex model is equivalent to the multiline queues of Martin (arXiv:1810.10650). For the colored q-Boson process and the q-PushTASEP on the ring, we recover and generalize known stationary measures constructed using multiline queues or other methods by Ayyer-Mandelshtam-Martin (arXiv:2011.06117, arXiv:2209.09859), and Bukh-Cox (arXiv:1912.03510). Our proofs of stationarity use the Yang-Baxter equation and bypass the Matrix Product Ansatz used for the mASEP by Prolhac-Evans-Mallick (arXiv:0812.3293).
  On the line and in a quadrant, we use the Yang-Baxter equation to establish a general colored Burke's theorem, which implies that suitable specializations of our queue vertex models produce stationary measures for particle systems on the line. We also compute the colored particle currents in stationarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of the first order Euler scheme and an approximative variant thereof, along with convergence rates, are established for rough differential equations driven by c\`adl\`ag paths satisfying a suitable criterion, namely the so-called Property (RIE), along time discretizations with vanishing mesh size. This property is then verified for almost all sample paths of Brownian motion, It\^o processes, L\'evy processes and general c\`adl\`ag semimartingales, as well as the driving signals of both mixed and rough stochastic differential equations, relative to various time discretizations. Consequently, we obtain pathwise convergence in p-variation of the Euler--Maruyama scheme for stochastic differential equations driven by these processes.</description>

Abstract: In this short note we study what happens in a symmetric opinion model when we send the total interacting population $N(t)$ to infinity as $t \to \infty$. We assume that new population enters the system with opinions that are i.i.d random vectors with finite mean and variance. We give sharp conditions on the rate of population growth that is required for convergence to a global consensus in opinions. More particularly, we show that if the total population increases at a rate $N(t)\sim e^{t^\alpha}$, then $\alpha&lt;1$ is necessary and sufficient condition for convergence to the mean of incoming opinions, and the convergence is achieved at an algebraic rate.</description>

      <title>The shape of the front of multidimensional branching Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the shape of the outer envelope of a branching Brownian motion (BBM) in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$. We focus on the extremal particles: those whose norm is within $O(1)$ of the maximal norm amongst the particles alive at time $t$. Our main result is a scaling limit, with exponent $3/2$, for the outer-envelope of the BBM around each extremal particle (the "front"); the scaling limit is a continuous random surface given explicitly in terms of a Bessel(3) process. Towards this end, we introduce a point process that captures the full landscape around each extremal particle and show convergence in distribution to an explicit point process. This complements the global description of the extremal process given in Berestycki et. al. (Ann. Probab. 52 (2024), no. 3, 955-982), where the local behavior at directions transversal to the radial component of the extremal particles is not addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural independence is the (conditional) independence that arises from the structure rather than the precise numerical values of a distribution. We develop this concept and relate it to $d$-separation and structural causal models.
  Formally, let $U = (U_i)_{i \in I}$ be an independent family of random elements on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$. Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be arbitrary $\sigma(U)$-measurable random elements. We characterize all independences $X \perp Y \mid Z$ implied by the independence of $U$ and call these independences \textit{structural}. Formally, these are the independences which hold in all probability measures $P$ that render $U$ independent and are absolutely continuous with respect to $\mathbb{P}$; i.e., for all such $P$, it must hold that $X \perp_P Y \mid Z$.
  We introduce the history $\mathcal{H}(X \mid Z) : \Omega \to \mathcal{P}(I)$, a combinatorial object that measures the dependence of $X$ on $U_i$ for each $i \in I$ given $Z$. The independence of $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$ is implied by the independence of $U$ if and only if $\mathcal{H}(X \mid Z) \cap \mathcal{H}(Y \mid Z) = \emptyset$ almost surely with respect to $\mathbb{P}$.
  Finally, we apply this $d$-separation-like criterion in structural causal models to discover a causal direction in a toy setting.</description>

Abstract: We recall the classical formulation of PageRank as the stationary distribution of a singularly perturbed irreducible Markov chain that is not irreducible when the perturbation parameter goes to zero. Specifically, we use the Markov chain tree theorem to derive explicit expressions for the PageRank. This analysis leads to some surprising results. These results are then extended to a much more general class of perturbations that subsume personalized PageRank. We also give examples where even simpler formulas for PageRank are possible.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue collisions for periodic matrix families associated with Ginibre matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17178v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study, count and locate the exceptional points where eigenvalues collide for certain families of matrices $$R(s,t) = \cos(s \pi / 2)C + \sin(s \pi / 2)U(t), \quad s,t \in [0,1]$$ where $C$ is a realization of a Ginibre random matrix, or a closely related matrix, and $U(t)$ is a $t$-periodic diagonal matrix whose eigenvalues move along the unit circle or other parameterized curves (simple or not).
  To do this, we track eigenvalues continuously along simple curves, searching for eigenvalue discrepancies after looping, indicating such collision-events inside said curves.
  Although stochastic in nature, the collision count for the circle cases repeatedly yielded $N(N-1)$ under fairly general circumstances, where $N$ is the matrix dimension. More collisions were observed for the elliptic generalization and for other curves.
  We include a package to compute and visualize these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices $H=(H_{xy})$, whose entries are centered complex Gaussian random variables. The indices $x,y$ range over the $d$-dimensional discrete torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ with $d\in \{1,2\}$ and $N=L^d$. The variance profile $S_{xy}=\mathbb E|h_{xy}|^2$ exhibits a banded structure: specifically, $S_{xy}=0$ whenever the distance $|x-y|$ exceeds a band width parameter $W\le L$. Let $W=L^\alpha$ for some exponent $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$. We show that as $\alpha$ increases from $\mathbf 1_{d=1}/2$ to $1-d/6$, the range of energies corresponding to delocalized eigenvectors gradually expands from the bulk toward the entire spectrum. More precisely, we prove that eigenvectors associated with energies $E$ satisfying $2 - |E| \gg N^{-c_{d,\alpha}}$ are delocalized, where the exponent $c_{d,\alpha}$ is given by $c_{d,\alpha} = 2\alpha - 1$ in dimension 1 and $c_{d,\alpha} = \alpha$ in dimension 2. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; 1-d/6$, all eigenvectors of $H$ become delocalized. We further establish quantum unique ergodicity for delocalized eigenvectors, as well as a rigidity estimate for the eigenvalues. Our findings extend previous results -- established in the bulk regime for one-dimensional (1D) (arXiv:2501.01718) and two-dimensional (2D) (arXiv:2503.07606) random band matrices -- to the entire spectrum, including the spectral edges. They also complement the results of arXiv:0906.4047 and arXiv:2401.00492, which concern the edge eigenvalue statistics for 1D and 2D random band matrices.</description>

      <title>$W$-entropy formulas and Langevin deformation on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first prove the $W$-entropy formula and rigidity theorem for the geodesic flow on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over a complete Riemannian manifold with bounded geometry condition. Then we introduce the Langevin deformation on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over a complete Riemannian manifold, which interpolates between the $p$-Laplacian heat equation and the geodesic flow on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space, where ${1\over p}+{1\over q}=1$, $1&lt; p, q&lt;\infty$. The local existence, uniqueness and regularity of the Langevin deformation on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over the Euclidean space and a compact Riemannian manifold are proved for $q\in [2, \infty)$. We further prove the $W$-entropy-information formula and the rigidity theorem for the Langevin deformation on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over an $n$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature, where $q\in (1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Zero-noise selection and Large Deviations in $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ for the stochastic transport equation beyond DiPerna-Lions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ solutions of the stochastic transport equation with drift in $L^\infty_t W^{1,q}_x$. We show strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions in a regime of parameters $p,q$ for which non-unique weak solutions of the deterministic transport equation exist. When the intensity of the noise goes to zero, we prove that the solutions of the stochastic transport equation converge to the unique renormalized solution of the transport equation in the sense of DiPerna-Lions. Furthermore, we show that the convergence is governed by a Large Deviations Principle in the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$. Since the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ is not separable, the weak convergence approach to Large Deviations by Budhiraja, Dupuis, and Maroulas is not directly applicable.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we work in the framework of Hilbert-valued Wiener structures and derive a functional version of the second-order Gaussian Poincar\'e inequality that leads to abstract bounds for Gaussian process approximation in $d_2$ distance. Our abstract bounds are flexible and can be applied in various examples including functional Breuer-Major central limit theorems, shallow neural networks, and spatial statistics of SPDEs solutions.</description>

      <title>Models of Opinion Dynamics with Random Parametrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of the Galam model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups -- people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.</description>

Abstract: In the graph shotgun assembly problem, we are given the balls of radius $r$ around each vertex of a graph and asked to reconstruct the graph. We study the shotgun assembly of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal G(n,p)$ for a wide range of values of $r$. We determine the threshold for reconstructibility for each $r\geq 3$, extending and improving substantially on results of Mossel and Ross for $r=3$. For $r=2$, we give upper and lower bounds that improve on results of Gaudio and Mossel by polynomial factors. We also give a sharpening of a result of Huang and Tikhomirov for $r=1$.</description>

      <title>Kernel Limit of Recurrent Neural Networks Trained on Ergodic Data Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical methods are developed to characterize the asymptotics of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the number of hidden units, data samples in the sequence, hidden state updates, and training steps simultaneously grow to infinity. In the case of an RNN with a simplified weight matrix, we prove the convergence of the RNN to the solution of an infinite-dimensional ODE coupled with the fixed point of a random algebraic equation. The analysis requires addressing several challenges which are unique to RNNs. In typical mean-field applications (e.g., feedforward neural networks), discrete updates are of magnitude $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the number of updates is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Therefore, the system can be represented as an Euler approximation of an appropriate ODE/PDE, which it will converge to as $N \rightarrow \infty$. However, the RNN hidden layer updates are $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, RNNs cannot be represented as a discretization of an ODE/PDE and standard mean-field techniques cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a fixed point analysis for the evolution of the RNN memory states, with convergence estimates in terms of the number of update steps and the number of hidden units. The RNN hidden layer is studied as a function in a Sobolev space, whose evolution is governed by the data sequence (a Markov chain), the parameter updates, and its dependence on the RNN hidden layer at the previous time step. Due to the strong correlation between updates, a Poisson equation must be used to bound the fluctuations of the RNN around its limit equation. These mathematical methods give rise to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) limits for RNNs trained on data sequences as the number of data samples and size of the neural network grow to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pairs $(A,B)$ of square matrices that are in additive (resp. multiplicative) finite free position, that is, the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{A+B}(x)$ (resp. $\chi_{AB}(x)$) equals the additive finite free convolution $\chi_{A}(x) \boxplus \chi_{B}(x)$ (resp. the multiplicative finite free convolution $\chi_{A}(x) \boxtimes \chi_{B}(x)$), which equals the expected characteristic polynomial $\mathbb{E}_U [ \chi_{A+U^* BU}(x) ]$ (resp. $\mathbb{E}_U [ \chi_{AU^* BU}(x) ]$) over the set of unitary matrices $U$. We examine the lattice of (non-irreducible) affine algebraic sets of matrices consisting of finite free complementary pairs with respect to the additive (resp. multiplicative) convolution. We show that these pairs include the diagonal matrices vs. the principally balanced matrices, the upper (lower) triangular matrices vs. the upper (lower) triangular matrices with constant diagonal, and the scalar matrices vs. the set of all square matrices.</description>

      <title>Drift Control with Discretionary Stopping for a Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic control with discretionary stopping for the drift of a diffusion process over an infinite time horizon. The objective is to choose a control process and a stopping time to minimize the expectation of a convex terminal cost in the presence of a fixed operating cost and a control-dependent running cost per unit of elapsed time. Under appropriate conditions on the coefficients of the controlled diffusion, an optimal pair of control and stopping rules is shown to exist. Moreover, under the same assumptions, it is shown that the optimal control is a constant which can be computed fairly explicitly; and that it is optimal to stop the first time an appropriate interval is visited. We consider also a constrained version of the above problem, in which an upper bound on the expectation of available stopping times is imposed; we show that this constrained problem can be reduced to an unconstrained problem with some appropriate change of parameters and, as a result, solved by similar arguments.</description>

      <title>A generalized neural tangent kernel for surrogate gradient learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.</description>

      <title>The saddlepoint approximation for averages of conditionally independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of saddlepoint approximations to resampling-based statistical tests, we prove that the Lugannani-Rice formula has vanishing relative error when applied to approximate conditional tail probabilities of averages of conditionally independent random variables. In a departure from existing work, this result is valid under only sub-exponential assumptions on the summands, and does not require any assumptions on their smoothness or lattice structure. The derived saddlepoint approximation result can be directly applied to resampling-based hypothesis tests, including bootstrap, sign-flipping and conditional randomization tests. We exemplify this by providing the first rigorous justification of a saddlepoint approximation for the sign-flipping test of symmetry about the origin, initially proposed in 1955. On the way to our main result, we establish a conditional Berry-Esseen inequality for sums of conditionally independent random variables, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is said to have won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5) and (49, 6, 6, 5) lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades. There is no absolute evidence beyond doubt, but the size of actual covering designs and the associated efforts allow the following hypothesis: Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5) covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery. Calculations indicate that he took considerable risks that his method might fail, because he limited himself to a subset of 15 numbers out of 49 numbers. The risks explain why he later changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot.</description>

      <title>Finite Dimensional Projections of HJB Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of controlled interacting particle systems with common noise started in [W. Gangbo, S. Mayorga and A. \'{S}wi\k{e}ch, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53 (2021), no. 2, 1320--1356] and [S. Mayorga and A. \'{S}wi\k{e}ch, SIAM J. Control Optim. 61 (2023), no. 2, 820--851]. First, we extend the following results of the previously mentioned works to the case of multiplicative noise: (i) We generalize the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ corresponding to control problems of $n$ particles to the value function $V$ corresponding to an appropriately defined infinite dimensional control problem; (ii) we prove, under certain additional assumptions, $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $V$ in the spatial variable. The second main contribution of the present work is the proof that if $DV$ is continuous (which, in particular, includes the previously proven case of $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the spatial variable), the value function $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$. Using this projection property, we show that optimal controls of the finite dimensional problem correspond to optimal controls of the infinite dimensional problem and vice versa. In the case of a linear state equation, we are able to prove that $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$ under relaxed assumptions on the coefficients of the cost functional by using approximation techniques in the Wasserstein space, thus covering cases where $V$ may not be differentiable.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable.
  In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ``outperforming" their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ``outperforming" property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.</description>

      <title>Minimax rates for learning kernels in operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning kernels in operators from data lies at the intersection of inverse problems and statistical learning, providing a powerful framework for capturing non-local dependencies in function spaces and high-dimensional settings. In contrast to classical nonparametric regression, where the inverse problem is well-posed, kernel estimation involves a compact normal operator and an ill-posed deconvolution. To address these challenges, we introduce adaptive spectral Sobolev spaces, which unify Sobolev spaces and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, automatically discarding non-identifiable components and controlling terms with small eigenvalues. Within this framework, we establish the minimax convergence rates for the mean squared error under both polynomial and exponential spectral decay regimes. Methodologically, we develop a tamed least squares estimator achieving the minimax upper rates via controlling the left-tail probability for eigenvalues of the random normal matrix; and for the minimax lower rates, we resolve challenges from infinite-dimensional measures through their projections.</description>

      <title>Conjunctions of Three "Euler Constants" in Poisson-Related Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three mathematical constants bear the name of the venerable Leonhard Euler: Euler's number, $e=2.718281\ldots$; the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577216\ldots$; and the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$. In the present work, we consider two joint appearances of these constants, one in a well-known equation of Hardy (interpretable in connection with inverse second moments of the Poisson probability distribution), and the other from a sequence of probabilities generated by recursively conditional Exponential (i.e., Poisson-event waiting-time) distributions. In both cases, we explore extensions of the initial observations to offer more comprehensive results.</description>

      <title>Conservative Coexpanding on Average Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the generator of a conservative IID random system whose dynamics expands on average codimension $1$ planes has an essential spectral radius strictly smaller than $1$ on Sobolev spaces of small positive index index. Consequently, such a system has finitely many ergodic components. If there is only one component for each power of the random system, then the system enjoys multiple exponential mixing and the central limit theorem. Moreover, these properties are stable under small perturbations. As an application we show that many small perturbations of random homogeneous systems are exponentially mixing.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, TD procedures are generally sensitive to step size specification. A poor choice of step size can dramatically increase variance and slow convergence in both on-policy and off-policy evaluation tasks. In practice, researchers use trial and error to identify stable step sizes, but these approaches tend to be ad hoc and inefficient. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed point equations. Such updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, we derive asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds for our proposed implicit TD algorithms, which include implicit TD(0), TD($\lambda$), and TD with gradient correction (TDC). Our results show that implicit TD algorithms are applicable to a much broader range of step sizes, and thus provide a robust and versatile framework for policy evaluation and value approximation in modern RL tasks. We demonstrate these benefits empirically through extensive numerical examples spanning both on-policy and off-policy tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastic systems with almost surely invariant manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for establishing non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastically forced dynamical systems possessing an almost surely invariant submanifold. Our main abstract result provides sufficient conditions for the existence of multiple stationary measures on compact manifolds, though the underlying methodology extends to non-compact settings. The key insight is to construct additional stationary measures by exploiting the linear instability of the invariant submanifold, as quantified by a positive transverse Lyapunov exponent.
  To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we apply it to the Lorenz 96 model with degenerate stochastic forcing, which serves as an example of both non-compact and high-dimensional dynamics. We prove that as the damping parameter becomes sufficiently small, the unique stationary measure bifurcates, giving rise to exactly two distinct stationary measures. The proof combines our general theory with computer-assisted verification of certain Lie algebra generation properties that ensure the required hypoellipticity and irreducibility conditions.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet $L$-functions on the critical line and multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the Dirichlet $L$-functions $L(1/2+ix,\chi_q)$, where $\chi_q$ is uniformly random Dirichlet character modulo $q$, converges to a random Schwartz distribution $\zeta_{\mathrm{rand}}$, which is related to (complex) Gaussian multiplicative chaos. This is the same limiting object that appeared in [34], where the authors proved that the random shifts of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line $\zeta(1/2+ix+i\omega T)$, where $\omega\sim \mathrm{Unif} ([0,1])$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}$, converge as $T\to \infty$.</description>
