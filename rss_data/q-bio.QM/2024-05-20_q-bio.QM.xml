      <title>No winners: Performance of lung cancer prediction models depends on screening-detected, incidental, and biopsied pulmonary nodule use cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical models for predicting lung cancer have the potential to facilitate earlier diagnosis of malignancy and avoid invasive workup of benign disease. Many models have been published, but comparative studies of their utility in different clinical settings in which patients would arguably most benefit are scarce. This study retrospectively evaluated promising predictive models for lung cancer prediction in three clinical settings: lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography, incidentally detected pulmonary nodules, and nodules deemed suspicious enough to warrant a biopsy. We leveraged 9 cohorts (n=898, 896, 882, 219, 364, 117, 131, 115, 373) from multiple institutions to assess the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of validated models including logistic regressions on clinical variables and radiologist nodule characterizations, artificial intelligence on chest CTs, longitudinal imaging AI, and multi-modal approaches. We implemented each model from their published literature, re-training the models if necessary, and curated each cohort from primary data sources. We observed that model performance varied greatly across clinical use cases. No single predictive model emerged as a clear winner across all cohorts, but certain models excelled in specific clinical contexts. Single timepoint chest CT AI performed well in lung screening, but struggled to generalize to other clinical settings. Longitudinal imaging and multimodal models demonstrated comparatively promising performance on incidentally-detected nodules. However, when applied to nodules that underwent biopsy, all models underperformed. These results underscore the strengths and limitations of 8 validated predictive models and highlight promising directions towards personalized, noninvasive lung cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Delivery strategies to improve piglets exposure to oral antibiotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread practice of delivering antibiotics through drinking water to livestock leads to considerable variability in exposure levels among animals, raising concerns regarding disease outbreaks and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This variability is primarily driven by three pivotal factors: fluctuations in drug concentration within water pipes, variances in drinking behavior among animals, and differences in individual pharmacokinetic parameters. This article introduces an approach aimed at improving medication distribution by customizing it according to the drinking patterns of pigs, without escalating the medication dose. As examples, we demonstrate that incorporating the drinking behavior into the delivery of amoxicillin results in an increase in the percentage of piglets reaching an AUC/MIC ratio greater than 25h. Specifically, with Pasteurella multocida, the percentage rises from 30% to at least 60%, while with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, it increases from 20% to more than 70%.</description>

      <title>Molecular techniques employed in CTG(Ser1) and CTG(Ala) D-xylose metabolizing yeast clades for strain design and industrial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: D-xylose is the second most abundant monosaccharide found in lignocellulose and is of biotechnological importance for producing second-generation ethanol and other high-value chemical compounds. D-xylose conversion to ethanol is promoted by microbial fermentation, mainly by bacteria, yeasts, or filamentous fungi. Considering yeasts, species belonging to the CTG(Ser1) or CTG(Ala) clade display a remarkable ability to ferment D-xylose to ethanol and other compounds; however, these yeasts are not employed on an industrial scale due to the poor fermentative performance compared to conventional yeasts, like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and also due to the lack of a molecular toolbox for development of new strains tailored to fermentation stress tolerance and performance. Thus, the purpose of this review is to evaluate the major molecular tools (e.g., transformation markers and techniques, vectors, regulatory sequences, and gene editing techniques) available for the most studied yeasts of CTG(Ser1) clade, like Scheffersomyces, Spathaspora, Candida and Yamadazyma species, and the CTG(Ala) clade representative Pachysolen tannophilus. Furthermore, we synthesized the current state-of-the-art molecular developments and perspectives for D-xylose fermenting yeast strain design.</description>

      <title>MicroBundlePillarTrack, A Python package for automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of pillar deflection in cardiac microbundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movies of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived engineered cardiac tissue (microbundles) contain abundant information about structural and functional maturity. However, extracting these data in a reproducible and high-throughput manner remains a major challenge. Furthermore, it is not straightforward to make direct quantitative comparisons across the multiple in vitro experimental platforms employed to fabricate these tissues. Here, we present "MicroBundlePillarTrack," an open-source optical flow-based package developed in Python to track the deflection of pillars in cardiac microbundles grown on experimental platforms with two different pillar designs ("Type 1" and "Type 2" design). Our software is able to automatically segment both pillars, track their displacements, and output time-dependent metrics for contractility analysis, including beating amplitude and rate, contractile force, and tissue stress. Because this software is fully automated, it will allow for both faster and more reproducible analyses of larger datasets and it will enable more reliable cross-platform comparisons as compared to existing approaches that require manual steps and are tailored to one specific experimental platform. To complement this open-source software, we share a dataset of 1,540 brightfield example movies on which we have tested our software. Through sharing this data and software, our goal is to directly enable quantitative comparisons across labs, and facilitate future collective progress via the biomedical engineering open-source data and software ecosystem.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Classifying Gene Mutations in Cancer using LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU, and GloVe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our study, we introduce a novel hybrid ensemble model that synergistically combines LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU, and GloVe embeddings for the classification of gene mutations in cancer. This model was rigorously tested using Kaggle's Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance across all evaluation metrics. Notably, our approach achieved a training accuracy of 80.6%, precision of 81.6%, recall of 80.6%, and an F1 score of 83.1%, alongside a significantly reduced Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2.596. These results surpass those of advanced transformer models and their ensembles, showcasing our model's superior capability in handling the complexities of gene mutation classification. The accuracy and efficiency of gene mutation classification are paramount in the era of precision medicine, where tailored treatment plans based on individual genetic profiles can dramatically improve patient outcomes and save lives. Our model's remarkable performance highlights its potential in enhancing the precision of cancer diagnoses and treatments, thereby contributing significantly to the advancement of personalized healthcare.</description>

      <title>Spatial information allows inference of the prevalence of direct cell-to-cell viral infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of direct cell-to-cell spread in viral infections - where virions spread between host and susceptible cells without needing to be secreted into the extracellular environment - has come to be understood as essential to the dynamics of medically significant viruses like hepatitis C and influenza. Recent work in both the experimental and mathematical modelling literature has attempted to quantify the prevalence of cell-to-cell infection compared to the conventional free virus route using a variety of methods and experimental data. However, estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and moreover rely on data collected by inhibiting one mode of infection by either chemical or physical factors, which may influence the other mode of infection to an extent which is difficult to quantify. In this work, we conduct a simulation-estimation study to probe the practical identifiability of the proportion of cell-to-cell infection, using two standard mathematical models and synthetic data that would likely be realistic to obtain in the laboratory. We show that this quantity cannot be estimated using non-spatial data alone, and that the collection of a data which describes the spatial structure of the infection is necessary to infer the proportion of cell-to-cell infection. Our results provide guidance for the design of relevant experiments and mathematical tools for accurately inferring the prevalence of cell-to-cell infection in $\textit{in vitro}$ and $\textit{in vivo}$ contexts.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling and Control of Medical Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vision of personalized medicine is to identify interventions that maintain or restore a person's health based on their individual biology. Medical digital twins, computational models that integrate a wide range of health-related data about a person and can be dynamically updated, are a key technology that can help guide medical decisions. Such medical digital twin models can be high-dimensional, multi-scale, and stochastic. To be practical for healthcare applications, they often need to be simplified into low-dimensional surrogate models that can be used for the optimal design of interventions. This paper introduces surrogate modeling algorithms for the purpose of optimal control applications. As a use case, we focus on agent-based models (ABMs), a common model type in biomedicine for which there are no readily available optimal control algorithms. By deriving surrogate models that are based on systems of ordinary differential equations, we show how optimal control methods can be employed to compute effective interventions, which can then be lifted back to a given ABM. The relevance of the methods introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>PLA-SGCN: Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction by Integrating Similar Pairs and Semi-supervised Graph Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The protein-ligand binding affinity (PLA) prediction goal is to predict whether or not the ligand could bind to a protein sequence. Recently, in PLA prediction, deep learning has received much attention. Two steps are involved in deep learning-based approaches: feature extraction and task prediction step. Many deep learning-based approaches concentrate on introducing new feature extraction networks or integrating auxiliary knowledge like protein-protein interaction networks or gene ontology knowledge. Then, a task prediction network is designed simply using some fully connected layers. This paper aims to integrate retrieved similar hard protein-ligand pairs in PLA prediction (i.e., task prediction step) using a semi-supervised graph convolutional network (GCN). Hard protein-ligand pairs are retrieved for each input query sample based on the manifold smoothness constraint. Then, a graph is learned automatically in which each node is a protein-ligand pair, and each edge represents the similarity between pairs. In other words, an end-to-end framework is proposed that simultaneously retrieves hard similar samples, learns protein-ligand descriptor, learns the graph topology of the input sample with retrieved similar hard samples (learn adjacency matrix), and learns a semi-supervised GCN to predict the binding affinity (as task predictor). The training step adjusts the parameter values, and in the inference step, the learned model is fine-tuned for each input sample. To evaluate the proposed approach, it is applied to the four well-known PDBbind, Davis, KIBA, and BindingDB datasets. The results show that the proposed method significantly performs better than the comparable approaches.</description>

      <title>Improved prediction of ligand-protein binding affinities by meta-modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate screening of candidate drug ligands against target proteins through computational approaches is of prime interest to drug development efforts. Such virtual screening depends in part on methods to predict the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Many computational models for binding affinity prediction have been developed, but with varying results across targets. Given that ensembling or meta-modeling methods have shown great promise in reducing model-specific biases, we develop a framework to integrate published force-field-based empirical docking and sequence-based deep learning models. In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual base models, training databases, and several meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep learning tools exclusively based on structures, while allowing for improved database scalability and flexibility through the explicit inclusion of features such as physicochemical properties or molecular descriptors. Overall, we demonstrate that diverse modeling approaches can be ensembled together to gain improvement in binding affinity prediction.</description>

Abstract: Considering a pair of genomes, the goal of rearrangement distance problems is to estimate how distant these genomes are from each other based on genome rearrangements. Seminal works in genome rearrangements assumed that both genomes being compared have the same set of genes (balanced genomes) and, furthermore, only the relative order of genes and their orientations, when they are known, are used in the mathematical representation of the genomes. In this case, the genomes are represented as permutations, originating the Sorting Permutations by Rearrangements problems. The main problems of Sorting Permutations by Rearrangements considered DCJs, reversals, transpositions, or the combination of both reversals and transpositions, and these problems have their complexity known. Besides these problems, other ones were studied involving the combination of transpositions with one or more of the following rearrangements: transreversals, revrevs, and reversals. Although there are approximation results for these problems, their complexity remained open. Some of the results of this thesis are the complexity proofs for these problems. Furthermore, we present a new 1.375-approximation algorithm, which has better time complexity, for the Sorting Permutations by Transpositions. When considering unbalanced genomes, it is necessary to use insertions and deletions to transform one genome into another. In this thesis, we studied Rearrangement Distance problems on unbalanced genomes considering only gene order and their orientations (when they are known), as well as Intergenic Rearrangement Distance problems, which incorporate the information regarding the size distribution of intergenic regions, besides the use of gene order and their orientations (when they are known). We present complexity proofs and approximation algorithms for problems that include reversals and transpositions.</description>

      <title>HGTDR: Advancing Drug Repurposing with Heterogeneous Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Drug repurposing is a viable solution for reducing the time and cost associated with drug development. However, thus far, the proposed drug repurposing approaches still need to meet expectations. Therefore, it is crucial to offer a systematic approach for drug repurposing to achieve cost savings and enhance human lives. In recent years, using biological network-based methods for drug repurposing has generated promising results. Nevertheless, these methods have limitations. Primarily, the scope of these methods is generally limited concerning the size and variety of data they can effectively handle. Another issue arises from the treatment of heterogeneous data, which needs to be addressed or converted into homogeneous data, leading to a loss of information. A significant drawback is that most of these approaches lack end-to-end functionality, necessitating manual implementation and expert knowledge in certain stages. Results: We propose a new solution, HGTDR (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer for Drug Repurposing), to address the challenges associated with drug repurposing. HGTDR is a three-step approach for knowledge graph-based drug re-purposing: 1) constructing a heterogeneous knowledge graph, 2) utilizing a heterogeneous graph transformer network, and 3) computing relationship scores using a fully connected network. By leveraging HGTDR, users gain the ability to manipulate input graphs, extract information from diverse entities, and obtain their desired output. In the evaluation step, we demonstrate that HGTDR performs comparably to previous methods. Furthermore, we review medical studies to validate our method's top ten drug repurposing suggestions, which have exhibited promising results. We also demon-strated HGTDR's capability to predict other types of relations through numerical and experimental validation, such as drug-protein and disease-protein inter-relations.</description>
