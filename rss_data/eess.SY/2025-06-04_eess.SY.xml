      <title>Optimal Coordination of Flexible DERs in Local Energy and Flexibility Markets to Ensure Social Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local electricity markets offer a promising solution for integrating renewable energy sources and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution networks. These markets enable the effective utilization of flexible resources by facilitating coordination among various agents. Beyond technical and economic considerations, addressing social equity within these local communities is critical and requires dedicated attention in market-clearing frameworks. This paper proposes a social equity-based market-clearing framework for the optimal management of DERs' energy and flexibility within local communities. The proposed framework incorporates consumers' energy burden to ensure fair pricing in energy market clearance. Furthermore, to ensure equity during unbalanced operating conditions, flexible resources are managed in the local flexibility market, ensuring that all participants can trade power fairly under network disturbances. The model is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) optimization and validated on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network.</description>

      <title>Second-Order-Cone Formulations of Power Flow for Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems that involve topology optimization in scenarios with large scale outages, such as post-disaster restoration or public safety power shutoff planning, are very challenging to solve. Using simple power flow representations such as DC power flow or network flow models results in low quality solutions which requires significantly higher-than-predicted load shed to become AC feasible. Recent work has shown that formulations based on the Second Order Cone (SOC) power flow formulation find very high quality solutions with low load shed, but the computational burden of these formulations remains a significant challenge. With the aim of reducing computational time while maintaining high solution quality, this work explores formulations which replace the conic constraints with a small number of linear cuts. The goal of this approach is not to find an exact power flow solution, but rather to identify good binary decisions, where the power flow can be resolved after the binary variables are fixed. We find that a simple reformulation of the Second Order Cone Optimal Power Shutoff problem can greatly improve the solution speed, but that a full linearization of the SOC voltage cone equation results in an overestimation of the amount of power that can be delivered to loads.</description>

      <title>SIL Allocation for Mitigation Safety Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SIL (Safety Integrity Level) allocation plays a pivotal role in evaluating the significance of Safety Functions (SFs) within high-risk industries. The outcomes of a SIL allocation study determine the design specifications necessary to uphold the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) below permissible limits, thus managing risk effectively. While extensive research has focused on SIL allocation for preventive SFs, there is a noticeable gap in attention towards mitigation SFs. To address this gap, this paper discusses the shortcomings of current methods and proposes a new approach to overcome them. The principles of the proposed method are substantiated by detailed mathematical formulation and the practical application of the method is demonstrated through a case study in a road tunnel project.</description>

      <title>Unit Commitment with Cost-Oriented Temporal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-adaptive unit commitment (UC) has recently been investigated to reduce the scheduling costs by flexibly varying the temporal resolution, which is usually determined by clustering the net load patterns. However, there exists a misalignment between cost and net load patterns due to the discrete start-up costs and out-of-merit-order dispatch triggered by ramping and other constraints. The optimal time-adaptive resolution cannot be completely captured by clustering-based method. This paper proposes a cost-oriented method to address this misalignment by a novel bilevel optimization approach that is efficiently solved through a heuristic greedy algorithm. The impact of varying temporal resolution on the final scheduling costs are tested, based on which the temporal resolution is heuristically updated, achieving significant cost reduction without increasing the number of temporal periods. Subsequently, an improved discretized Adam optimization method together with offline warm start and online refinement strategy is proposed to efficiently search for the better temporal resolution configuration. Results show that the proposed cost-oriented UC temporal resolution determination method achieves enhanced cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Recursive Privacy-Preserving Estimation Over Markov Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industrial applications, the presence of moving machinery, vehicles, and personnel, contributes to the dynamic nature of the wireless channel. This time variability induces channel fading, which can be effectively modeled using a Markov fading channel (MFC). In this paper, we investigate the problem of secure state estimation for systems that communicate over a MFC in the presence of an eavesdropper. The objective is to enable a remote authorized user to accurately estimate the states of a dynamic system, while considering the potential interception of the sensor's packet through a wiretap channel. To prevent information leakage, a novel co-design strategy is established, which combines a privacy-preserving mechanism with a state estimator. To implement our encoding scheme, a nonlinear mapping of the innovation is introduced based on the weighted reconstructed innovation previously received by the legitimate user. Corresponding to this encoding scheme, we design a recursive privacy-preserving filtering algorithm to achieve accurate estimation. The boundedness of estimation error dynamics at the legitimate user's side is discussed and the divergence of the eavesdropper's estimation error is analyzed, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our co-design strategy in ensuring secrecy. Furthermore, a simulation example of a three-tank system is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our privacy-preserving estimation method.</description>

      <title>Quantized Dissipative Uncertain Model for Fractional T_S Fuzzy systems with Time_Varying Delays Under Networked Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addressed with the quantized dissipative uncertain problem for delayed fractional T_S Fuzzy system for event_triggered networked systems (E_NS), where the extended dissipativity analysis combines the H infinity, dissipativity, L2 and L infinity and passivity performance in a unified frame. To attain the high efficiency for available channel resources, measurement size decrease mechanism and event_triggered scheme (ETS) are proposed. Firstly, we present the ETS in which signal is transmitted through the channel with logical function then logarithmic quantization methodology is implemented for size reduction. Then, we transfer the original delayed fractional T_S fuzzy systems with the effect of quantization under ETS as induced communications delays. Furthermore, by employing the associative Lyapunov functional method in terms of linear matrix inequalities, adequate conditions for asymptotical stability is given. Moreover, we also construct the design fuzzy model for state space filtering system. At last, a truck_trailer model is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Target Sensing Performance in Disaster-Specific ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology emerges, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks offer significant potential for enhancing real-time monitoring in disaster areas. However, existing ISAC approaches often fail to address the unique challenges of dynamic and cluttered disaster areas, resulting in limited sensing coverage and interruptions in sensing service. To address these limitations, this work proposes a mobile ISAC network specifically designed for disaster scenarios. By leveraging stochastic geometry, we derive closed-form expressions for sensing coverage and introduce a novel performance metric to evaluate sensing service continuity. Simulation results validate the analytical derivations and offer key insights into network design.</description>

      <title>On dual-rate consensus under transmission delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of dual-rate consensus under transmission delays, where the control updates happen at a faster rate than the measurements being received. We assume that the measurements are delayed by a fixed delay and show that for all delays and rates, the system reaches a consensus if and only if the communication graph of the agents is connected and the control gain is chosen in a specific interval. Based on these results we dive deeper into the convergence properties and investigate how the convergence changes when we change the rate for sending measurements. We observe that in certain cases there exists a sweet spot for choosing the sampling rate of the measurements, which can improve the convergence to the consensus point. We then formulate an optimization problem to find a sampling rate to improve the convergence speed and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a finite optimizer of this problem. Our results are verified with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-MIX: Enhancing Sample Efficiency in Multi-Agent RL Using Ensemble Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms typically require significantly more environment interactions than their single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning, incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$) algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL, mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of SMAC II maps.</description>

      <title>Backpressure-based Mean-field Type Game for Scheduling in Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) framework for effective scheduling in multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using backpressure as a performance criterion. Traditional backpressure algorithms leverage queue differentials to regulate data flow and maintain network stability. In this work, we extend the backpressure framework by incorporating a mean-field term into the cost functional, capturing the global behavior of the system alongside local dynamics. The resulting model utilizes the strengths of non-cooperative mean-field type games, enabling nodes to make decentralized decisions based on both individual queue states and system mean-field effects while accounting for stochastic network interactions. By leveraging the interplay between backpressure dynamics and mean-field coupling, the approach balances local optimization with global efficiency. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling congestion and scheduling in large-scale WSNs.</description>

      <title>Investigating Timing-Based Information Leakage in Data Flow-Driven Real-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leaking information about the execution behavior of critical real-time tasks may lead to serious consequences, including violations of temporal constraints and even severe failures. We study information leakage for a special class of real-time tasks that have two execution modes, namely, typical execution (which invokes the majority of times) and critical execution (to tackle exceptional conditions). The data flow-driven applications inherit such a multimode execution model. In this paper, we investigate whether a low-priority "observer" task can infer the execution patterns of a high-priority "victim" task (especially the critical executions). We develop a new statistical analysis technique and show that by analyzing the response times of the low-priority task, it becomes possible to extract the execution behavior of the high-priority task. We test our approach against a random selection technique that arbitrarily classifies a job as critical. We find that correlating the observer's response times with the victim's jobs can result in higher precision in identifying critical invocations compared to a random guess. We conduct extensive evaluations with systemically generated workloads, including a case study using a UAV autopilot (ArduPilot) taskset parameters. We found that our inference algorithm can achieve relatively low false positive rates (less than 25%) with relatively low footprint (1 MB memory and 50 ms timing overhead on a Raspberry Pi 4 platform). We further demonstrate the feasibility of inference on two cyber-physical platforms: an off-the-shelf manufacturing robot and a custom-built surveillance system.</description>

      <title>Bregman Centroid Guided Cross-Entropy Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.</description>

      <title>Active inference as a unified model of collision avoidance behavior in human drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision avoidance -- involving a rapid threat detection and quick execution of the appropriate evasive maneuver -- is a critical aspect of driving. However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution. Our results highlight the potential of active inference as a unified framework for understanding and modeling human behavior in complex real-life driving tasks.</description>

      <title>Second-order AAA algorithms for structured data-driven modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data-driven modeling of dynamical systems has become an essential tool for the construction of accurate computational models from real-world data. In this process, the inherent differential structures underlying the considered physical phenomena are often neglected making the reinterpretation of the learned models in a physically meaningful sense very challenging. In this work, we present three data-driven modeling approaches for the construction of dynamical systems with second-order differential structure directly from frequency domain data. Based on the second-order structured barycentric form, we extend the well-known Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm to the case of second-order systems. Depending on the available computational resources, we propose variations of the proposed method that prioritize either higher computation speed or greater modeling accuracy, and we present a theoretical analysis for the expected accuracy and performance of the proposed methods. Three numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new structured approaches in comparison to classical unstructured data-driven modeling.</description>

      <title>Experimental Covert Communication Using Software-Defined Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental information-theoretic limits of covert, or low probability of detection (LPD), communication have been extensively studied for over a decade, resulting in the square root law (SRL): only $L\sqrt{n}$ covert bits can be reliably transmitted over time-bandwidth product $n$, for constant $L&gt;0$. Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The SRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of provably-secure covert communication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is underexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert communication are available, both focusing on optical channels. Here, we report our initial results demonstrating the provably-secure covert radio-frequency (RF) communication using software-defined radios (SDRs). These validate theoretical predictions, open practical avenues for implementing covert communication systems, as well as raise future research questions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic real-time multi-UAV cooperative mission planning method under multiple constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As UAV popularity soars, so does the mission planning associated with it. The classical approaches suffer from the triple problems of decoupled of task assignment and path planning, poor real-time performance and limited adaptability. Aiming at these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic real-time multi-UAV collaborative mission planning algorithm based on Dubins paths under a distributed formation structure. Dubins path with multiple advantages bridges the gap between task assignment and path planning, leading to a coupled solution for mission planning. Then, a series of acceleration techniques, task clustering preprocessing, highly efficient distance cost functions, low-complexity and less iterative task allocation strategies, are employed to guarantee the real-time performance of the algorithms. To cope with different emergencies and their simultaneous extremes, real-time planning of emerging tasks and mission replanning due to the reduction of available UAVs are appropriately handled. Finally, the developed algorithm is comprehensively exemplified and studied through simulations, highlighting that the proposed method only sacrifices 9.57% of the path length, while achieving a speed improvement of 4-5 orders of magnitude over the simulated annealing method, with a single mission planning of about 0.0003s.</description>

      <title>Olfactory Inertial Odometry: Methodology for Effective Robot Navigation by Scent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Olfactory navigation is one of the most primitive mechanisms of exploration used by organisms. Navigation by machine olfaction (artificial smell) is a very difficult task to both simulate and solve. With this work, we define olfactory inertial odometry (OIO), a framework for using inertial kinematics, and fast-sampling olfaction sensors to enable navigation by scent analogous to visual inertial odometry (VIO). We establish how principles from SLAM and VIO can be extrapolated to olfaction to enable real-world robotic tasks. We demonstrate OIO with three different odour localization algorithms on a real 5-DoF robot arm over an odour-tracking scenario that resembles real applications in agriculture and food quality control. Our results indicate success in establishing a baseline framework for OIO from which other research in olfactory navigation can build, and we note performance enhancements that can be made to address more complex tasks in the future.</description>

      <title>Geometric Visual Servo Via Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When developing control laws for robotic systems, the principle factor when examining their performance is choosing inputs that allow smooth tracking to a reference input. In the context of robotic manipulation, this involves translating an object or end-effector from an initial pose to a target pose. Robotic manipulation control laws frequently use vision systems as an error generator to track features and produce control inputs. However, current control algorithms don't take into account the probabilistic features that are extracted and instead rely on hand-tuned feature extraction methods. Furthermore, the target features can exist in a static pose thus allowing a combined pose and feature error for control generation. We present a geometric control law for the visual servoing problem for robotic manipulators. The input from the camera constitutes a probability measure on the 3-dimensional Special Euclidean task-space group, where the Wasserstein distance between the current and desired poses is analogous with the geometric geodesic. From this, we develop a controller that allows for both pose and image-based visual servoing by combining classical PD control with gravity compensation with error minimization through the use of geodesic flows on a 3-dimensional Special Euclidean group. We present our results on a set of test cases demonstrating the generalisation ability of our approach to a variety of initial positions.</description>

      <title>CLONE: Customizing LLMs for Efficient Latency-Aware Inference at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is crucial for delivering fast responses and ensuring data privacy. However, the limited storage, weight, and power of edge devices make it difficult to deploy LLM-powered applications. These devices must balance latency requirements with energy consumption and model accuracy. In this paper, we first quantify the challenges of deploying LLMs on off-the-shelf edge devices and then we present CLONE, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design at both the model- and system-level that intelligently integrates real-time, energy optimization while maintaining robust generality. In order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize in a 28nm scalable hardware accelerator system. We implement and extensively evaluate CLONE on two off-the-shelf edge platforms. Experiments show that CLONE effectively accelerates the inference process up to 11.92x, and saves energy up to 7.36x, while maintaining high-generation.</description>

      <title>Computation- and Communication-Efficient Online FL for Resource-Constrained Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately. Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts.</description>

      <title>Back to Base: Towards Hands-Off Learning via Safe Resets with Reach-Avoid Safety Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing controllers that accomplish tasks while guaranteeing safety constraints remains a significant challenge. We often want an agent to perform well in a nominal task, such as environment exploration, while ensuring it can avoid unsafe states and return to a desired target by a specific time. In particular we are motivated by the setting of safe, efficient, hands-off training for reinforcement learning in the real world. By enabling a robot to safely and autonomously reset to a desired region (e.g., charging stations) without human intervention, we can enhance efficiency and facilitate training. Safety filters, such as those based on control barrier functions, decouple safety from nominal control objectives and rigorously guarantee safety. Despite their success, constructing these functions for general nonlinear systems with control constraints and system uncertainties remains an open problem. This paper introduces a safety filter obtained from the value function associated with the reach-avoid problem. The proposed safety filter minimally modifies the nominal controller while avoiding unsafe regions and guiding the system back to the desired target set. By preserving policy performance while allowing safe resetting, we enable efficient hands-off reinforcement learning and advance the feasibility of safe training for real world robots. We demonstrate our approach using a modified version of soft actor-critic to safely train a swing-up task on a modified cartpole stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Matrix Regression via Least-Angle Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix regression is a fundamental problem in data science with various applications in systems and control. Nuclear norm regularization has been widely applied to solve this problem due to its convexity. However, it suffers from high computational complexity and the inability to directly specify the rank. This work introduces a novel framework for low-rank matrix regression that addresses both unstructured and Hankel matrices. By decomposing the low-rank matrix into rank-1 bases, the problem is reformulated as an infinite-dimensional sparse learning problem. The least-angle regression (LAR) algorithm is then employed to solve this problem efficiently. For unstructured matrices, a closed-form LAR solution is derived with equivalence to a normalized nuclear norm regularization problem. For Hankel matrices, a real-valued polynomial basis reformulation enables effective LAR implementation. Two numerical examples in network modeling and system realization demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the nuclear norm method in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Net Load Forecasting for High-Penetration RES Grids Utilizing Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources (RES) in modern power systems has fundamentally compromised the reliability and accuracy of deterministic net load forecasting. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>HBS -- Hardware Build System: A Tcl-based, minimal common abstraction approach for build system for hardware designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Build systems become an indispensable part of the software implementation and deployment process. New programming languages are released with the build system integrated into the language tools, for example, Go, Rust, or Zig. However, in the hardware description domain, no official build systems have been released with the predominant Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as VHDL or SystemVerilog. Moreover, hardware design projects are often multilanguage.
  The paper proposes a new build system for the hardware description domain. The system is called the Hardware Build System (HBS). The main goals of the system include simplicity, readability, a minimal number of dependencies, and ease of integration with the existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. The system proposes a novel, minimal common abstraction approach, whose particular implications are described in the article. All the core functionalities are implemented in Tcl. Only the EDA tool's independent features, such as dependency graph generation, are implemented in a Python wrapper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically requiring observations of the full physical state. In practice, sensors often provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method, data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates (i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the control of partially observable chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Predictable Reinforcement Learning Dynamics through Entropy Rate Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18703v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.</description>

      <title>Joint Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems under Smoothness Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint learning of multiple linear dynamical systems. This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems, each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous parking control strategy for an active-joint center-articulated mobile robot. We first derive a kinematic model of the robot, then propose a control law to stabilize the vehicle's configuration within a small neighborhood of the goal. The control law, designed using Lyapunov techniques, is based on the robot's polar coordinate equations. A beacon-based guidance system provides feedback on the target's position and orientation. Simulations demonstrate the robot's ability to park successfully from arbitrary initial poses.</description>
