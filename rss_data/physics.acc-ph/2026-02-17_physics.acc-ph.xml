      <title>Demonstration of High-Gain Harmonic Lasing in a Terahertz Free-Electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) offering broad, continuous spectral tunability are traditionally constrained by fixed-parameter magnetic structures and the necessity for high-energy electron beams. High-gain Harmonic Lasing (HL) has long been proposed as a solution to overcome these limitations; however, a robust experimental verification of this principle has remained absent. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of high-gain HL. By employing a frequency-tunable electron beam density modulation to dominate the fundamental instability, we achieved sustained FEL amplification at the 3rd and 5th harmonics of the wiggler. The HL mode generated output power comparable to conventional fundamental operation with enhanced stability and narrower spectral bandwidth. Notably, we demonstrate that HL extends the spectral coverage by a factor of two under fixed facility constraints, achieving pulse energies up to 540 {\mu}J. These results establish high-gain HL as a versatile mechanism for advancing compact, wavelength-flexible FEL facilities.</description>

      <title>Cryogenics and the use of superfluid helium in high-energy particle accelerators (1980-2000)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The period 1980-2000 saw the impressive development of applied superconductivity in high-energy particle accelerators, from single components to long strings of superconducting magnets and high-frequency acceleration cavities. Large and powerful cryogenic systems were designed ancillary to superconducting devices operating generally close to the normal boiling point of helium, but also above 4.2 K in supercritical and below 2 K in superfluid. Low-temperature operation in accelerators also involves considerations of ultra-high vacuum, limited stored energy and beam stability. We recall the rationale for cryogenics in high-energy particle accelerators and review its development over the period of interest, with reference to the main engineering domains of cryostat design and heat loads, cooling schemes, efficient power refrigeration and cryogenic fluid management. In view of its importance and novelty, a specific section is devoted to the developments that led to the LHC at CERN.</description>

      <title>An x-ray regenerative amplifier free-electron laser with a step-tapered-undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regenerative amplifier x-ray free-electron lasers constitute alternative configurations for fourth generation light sources which are typically operated in self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) mode. However, SASE exhibits relatively large fluctuations in the power and spectral properties from shot to shot, whereas XRAFELs provide a much more stable source of hard x-ray photons. Here, we study the performance of an x-ray cavity under consideration at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Facility using both uniform and step-tapered undulators with either transmissive or hole out-coupling.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of HomHBFEM Simulations of Fast Corrector Magnets for PETRA IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental validation of the homogenized harmonic balance finite element method (HomHBFEM), which we have developed as a dedicated simulation technique for magnets with fast excitation cycles, in particular the fast corrector (FC) magnets for PETRA IV at DESY. The HomHBFEM allows efficient three-dimensional nonlinear eddy-current simulations of laminated magnets at elevated frequencies with a relatively coarse finite element (FE) mesh and without computationally expensive time-stepping. This is achieved by combining a frequency-domain-based homogenization technique with the harmonic balance FE method. The simulation results for the magnetic flux density along the axis of the FC magnets as a function of frequency and the resulting integrated transfer function (ITF) are compared to Hall probe and search coil measurements of the first prototype FC magnet for PETRA IV. A good agreement between simulated and measured ITFs is achieved for excitation frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.</description>

      <title>Application of RFSoC Technology for Beam Position Monitors at the SuperKEKB Storage Rings Injection Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to achieve its ambitious luminosity target, the SuperKEKB collider must achieve and sustain high beam currents on the order of Ampere in its storage rings. This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the laser pulse phase velocity in plasma channel for DLA optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel, direct method for measuring the phase velocity $v_{\phi}$ of an intense laser pulse within a plasma channel - the crucial parameter that controls the resonance condition in direct laser acceleration (DLA). The technique exploits the second harmonic (SH) radiation generated at the channel sheath - a phenomenon previously observed in laser-wakefield acceleration experiments. The SH emission angle is governed by a phase-matching condition that directly depends on $v_{\phi}$. Experimental measurements performed using a 1 TW, 10 Hz Ti:Sa laser system yield phase velocities in the range $v_{\phi}=(1.010-1.030)c$ for plasma electron densities in the range $n_e=(0.01-0.06)n_{cr}$. The diagnostic is validated through quasi-3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that reproduce the experimental conditions. This work provides a way to optimize DLA schemes by enabling in-situ measurement of the laser pulse phase velocity in plasma channels.</description>

      <title>Effective Caldirola-Kanai Model for Accelerating Twisted Dirac States in Nonuniform Axial Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relativistic twisted (orbital-angular-momentum) states of a massive charged particle propagating through an axially symmetric, longitudinally inhomogeneous solenoid field and a co-directed accelerating or decelerating electric field. Starting from the Dirac equation and using controlled spinless and paraxial approximations, we show that the transverse envelope obeys an effective nonstationary Schr\"odinger equation governed by a Caldirola--Kanai Hamiltonian. The longitudinal energy gain or loss encoded in $f(z)=[E_0-V(z)]^2-m^2$ generates an effective gain or damping rate $\widetilde{\gamma}(z)=\partial_z f(z)/[2f(z)]$ and a $z$-dependent oscillator frequency $\widetilde{\omega}(z)=p_0\Omega(z)/\sqrt{f(z)}$. Exploiting the Ermakov mapping (unitary equivalence of Caldirola--Kanai systems), we obtain a closed-form propagated twisted wave function by transforming the stationary Landau basis. The transverse evolution is controlled by a single scaling function $b(z)$ that satisfies a generalized Ermakov--Pinney equation with coefficients determined by $E_z(z)$ and $B_z(z)$. In the limiting cases of uniform acceleration with $B_z=0$ and of solenoid focusing with negligible acceleration, our solution reduces to previously known analytic results, providing a direct bridge to established models.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum beam dynamics simulation of the RF photoinjector test bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, aimed at producing high-quality electron beams and enabling future generation of relativistic vortex electrons with a quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Simulations of the 1.5-cell photogun are performed assuming an RF gradient of 45 MV/m, which, in accordance with our simulations with CST Studio, corresponds to the currently achieved input RF power of 3 MW. At low charge (Q = 0.63 pC), stable bunch formation is obtained, with weak space-charge effects and transverse emittance dominated by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and cathode solenoid results in a robust emittance-compensated regime with a final normalized emittance of 2.08 pi mm mrad. To assess prospects for accelerating vortex electron beams, we additionally model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The results show that multi-MeV acceleration suppresses free-space spreading of the electron packet and preserves the packet's initial OAM structure, indicating that the test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.</description>

      <title>First Experimental Demonstration of Beam Storage by Three-Dimensional Spiral Injection Scheme for Ultra-Compact Storage Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional spiral injection enables beam storage in ultra-compact rings with nanosecond revolution periods. We report first storage of a $297 \, \mathrm{keV/}c$ electron beam in a $22 \,\mathrm{cm}$ weak-focusing ring with a $4.7\,\mathrm{ns}$ revolution period using a $140\,\mathrm{ns}$ kicker pulse. A scintillating-fiber detector observes signals $&gt;5\sigma$ above noise for $\geq 1\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, and varying the weak-focusing field potential shifts the stored-beam region, consistent with Monte Carlo predictions, validating beam storage. This proof-of-principle opens a path to ultra-compact storage rings for next-generation precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Generation of high-OAM ultraviolet twisted light for RF-photoinjector applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of relativistic vortex electron beams via photoemission requires ultraviolet laser beams with well-controlled orbital angular momentum (OAM) and compatibility with radio-frequency (RF) photoinjector drive-laser systems. High-OAM vortex beams at a wavelength of 266 nm are generated using three fabricated diffractive optical elements integrated into an operational photoinjector beamline: a reflective fork grating, a high-topological-charge spiral phase plate, and binary axicons. The spiral phase plate produces a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with an OAM of l = 64 and a conversion efficiency of 80%, whereas binary axicons generate low-divergence quasi-Bessel beams forming a superposition of multiple OAM states with a finite OAM bandwidth imposed by their binary phase structure. Fork gratings provide flexible access to lower OAM values and enable robust modal diagnostics. The generated beams are characterized using cylindrical-lens mode conversion and radial intensity analysis, demonstrating practical control of both the OAM content and spectral bandwidth of ultraviolet structured light for accelerator-based applications.</description>
