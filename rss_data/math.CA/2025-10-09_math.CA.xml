      <title>The quasi-Assouad dimension of $(1,2t)$-Furstenberg sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is extremized by sticky sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(1,2t)$-Furstenberg set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is naturally defined as a set containing a union of unit line segments forming a $2t$-dimensional subset of the affine Grassmannian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and satisfying a suitable variant of the Frostman Convex Wolff Axiom. Some of these sets have a multi-scale self-similarity property called stickiness. We investigate the extremizers of the quasi-Assouad dimension of $(1,2t)$-Furstenberg sets, a slightly stronger variant of the Assouad dimension. We prove that sticky $(1,2t)$-Furstenberg sets have the least possible quasi-Assouad dimension among all $(1,2t)$-Furstenberg sets.</description>

      <title>On the best constant in the finitary Vitali covering lemma for high dimensional cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma_d$ be the largest constant such that every finite collection of cubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes admits a disjoint sub-collection occupying a fraction $\Gamma_d$ of its volume. Vitali's greedy algorithm shows that $\Gamma_d\geq 3^{-d}$, and cutting a cube into its $2^d$ dyadic sub-cubes gives $\Gamma_d\leq 2^{-d}$. The question of determining the value of $\Gamma_d$ was first raised by T.~Rad\'o in a 1927 letter to Sierpinski.
  In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of $\Gamma_d$ in the high-dimensional limit. We prove that there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that \[
  \Gamma_d\geq c\frac{2^{-d}}{d\log d}
  \] in all dimensions $d$, a significant asymptotic improvement of earlier results by R.~Rado (1949) and Bereg--Dumitrescu--Jiang (2010). This gives an answer to problem D6 in Croft--Falconer--Guy's book "Unsolved problems in geometry".</description>

      <title>Two-scale branching functions and inhomogeneous attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a two-scale branching function associated with an arbitrary metric space, which encodes the lower and upper box dimensions as well as the Assouad spectrum. If the metric space is quasi-doubling, this function is approximately Lipschitz. We fully classify the attainable Lipschitz two-scale branching functions, which gives a new proof of the classification of Assouad spectra due to the second author.
  We then study inhomogeneous self-conformal sets satisfying standard separation conditions. We show that the two-scale branching function of the attractor is given explicitly in terms of the two-scale branching function of the condensation set and the Hausdorff dimension of the homogeneous attractor. In particular, this gives formulas for the lower box dimension and the Assouad spectrum of the attractor.</description>

      <title>Disconnected large bifurcation supports and Cartesian products of bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bifurcation that occurs in a multiparameter family is a Cartesian product if it splits into two factors in the sense that one bifurcation takes place in one part of the phase portrait, another one -- in another part, and they are in a sense independent, do not interact with each other. To understand how a family bifurcates, it is sufficient to study it in a neighborhood of the so-called large bifurcation support. Given a family of vector fields on $S^2$ that unfolds a field $v_0$, the respective large bifurcation support is a closed $v_0$-invariant subset of the sphere indicating parts of the phase portrait of $v_0$ affected by bifurcations. One should consider disconnected large bifurcation supports in order to obtain Cartesian products for sure. We prove that, if the large bifurcation support is disconnected and the restriction of the original family to some neighborhood of each connected component is structurally stable (plus some mild extra conditions), then the original family is a Cartesian product of the bifurcations that occur near the components of the large bifurcation support. We also show that the structural stability requirement cannot be omitted.</description>

      <title>A Kakeya maximal function estimate in four dimensions using planebrushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.00989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an improved Kakeya maximal function estimate and improved Kakeya Hausdorff dimension estimate in $\mathbb{R}^4$ using a new geometric argument called the planebrush. A planebrush is a higher dimensional analogue of Wolff's hairbrush, which gives effective control on the size of Besicovitch sets when the lines through a typical point concentrate into a plane. When Besicovitch sets do not have this property, the existing trilinear estimates of Guth-Zahl can be used to bound the size of a Besicovitch set. In particular, we establish a maximal function estimate in $\mathbb{R}^4$ at dimension 3.049, and we prove that every Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^4$ must have Hausdorff dimension at least 3.059.</description>

      <title>Sticky Kakeya sets and the sticky Kakeya conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Kakeya set is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that contains a unit line segment pointing in every direction. The Kakeya conjecture asserts that such sets must have Hausdorff and Minkowski dimension $n$. There is a special class of Kakeya sets, called sticky Kakeya sets. Sticky Kakeya sets exhibit an approximate multi-scale self-similarity, and sets of this type played an important role in Katz, {\L}aba, and Tao's groundbreaking 1999 work on the Kakeya problem. We propose a special case of the Kakeya conjecture, which asserts that sticky Kakeya sets must have Hausdorff and Minkowski dimension $n$. We prove this conjecture in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>On Maximal Functions Associated to Families of Curves in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $L^p$ mapping properties of maximal averages associated to families of curves, and thickened curves, in the plane. These include the (planar) Kakeya maximal function, the circular maximal functions of Wolff and Bourgain, and their multi-parameter analogues. We propose a framework that allows for a unified study of such maximal functions, and prove sharp $L^p\to L^p$ operator bounds in this setting. A key ingredient is an estimate from discretized incidence geometry that controls the number of higher order approximate tangencies spanned by a collection of plane curves. We discuss applications to the F\"assler-Orponen restricted projection problem, and the dimension of Furstenberg-type sets associated to families of curves.</description>

Abstract: We prove a wavelet $T(1)$ theorem for compactness of multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund (CZ) operators. Our approach characterizes compactness in terms of testing conditions and yields a representation theorem for compact CZ forms in terms of wavelet and paraproduct forms that reflect the compact nature of the operator.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish several optimal estimates for exceptional parameters in the projection of fractal measures: (1) For a parametric family of self-similar measures satisfying a transversality condition, the set of parameters leading to a dimension drop is at most countable. (2) For any ergodic CP-distribution $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the Hausdorff dimension of its orthogonal projection is $\min\{1, \dim Q\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. Applications of our projection results include: (i) For any planar Borel probability measure with uniform entropy dimension $\alpha$, the packing dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $\min\{1, \alpha\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. (ii) For any planar set $F$, the Assouad dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $ \min\{1, \dim_{\rm A} F\} $ in all but at most countably many directions.</description>

      <title>A refined variant of Hartley convolution: Algebraic structures and related issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel convolution product associated with the $\mathscr{H}$-transform, denoted by $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$, and explore its fundamental properties. Here, the $\mathscr{H}$-transform may be regarded as a refined variant of the classical Fourier, Hartley transform, with kernel function depending on two parameters $a,b$. Our first contribution shows that the space of integrable functions, equipped with multiplication given by the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution, constitutes the commutative Banach algebra over the complex field, albeit without an identity element. Second, we prove the Wiener--L\'evy invertibility criterion for the $\mathscr H$-algebra and formulate Gelfand's spectral radius theorem. Third, we obtain a sharp form of Young's inequality for the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution and its direct corollary. Finally, all of these theoretical findings are applied to investigate specific classes of the Fredholm integral equations and heat source problems, yielding a priori estimates under the established assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We give 39 rapidly convergent continued fractions for Chowla--Selberg gamma quotients, and deduce good irrationality measures for 20 of them, including for $\operatorname{CS}(-3)=(\Gamma(1/3)/\Gamma(2/3))^3$, for $a^{1/4}\operatorname{CS}(-4)=a^{1/4}(\Gamma(1/4)/\Gamma(3/4))^2$ with $a=12$ and $a=1/5$, and for $\operatorname{CS}(-7)=\Gamma(1/7)\Gamma(2/7)\Gamma(4/7)/(\Gamma(3/7)\Gamma(5/7)\Gamma(6/7))$. These appear to be the first proved and reasonable irrationality measures for gamma quotients.</description>
