      <title>Bridging Simulation and Silicon: A Study of RISC-V Hardware and FireSim Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RISC-V ISA-based processors have recently emerged as both powerful and energy-efficient computing platforms. The release of the MILK-V Pioneer marked a significant milestone as the first desktop-grade RISC-V system. With increasing engagement from both academia and industry, such platforms exhibit strong potential for adoption in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
  The open-source, FPGA-accelerated FireSim framework has emerged as a flexible and scalable tool for architectural exploration, enabling simulation of various system configurations using RISC-V cores. Despite its capabilities, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation regarding the feasibility and performance prediction accuracy of FireSim when compared to physical hardware.
  In this study, we address this gap by modeling a commercially available single-board computer and a desktop-grade RISC-V CPU within FireSim. To ensure fidelity between simulation and real hardware, we first measure the performance of a series of benchmarks to compare runtime behavior under single-core and four-core configurations. Based on the closest matching simulation parameters, we subsequently evaluate performance using a representative mini-application and the LAMMPS molecular dynamics code.
  Our findings indicate that while FireSim provides valuable insights into architectural performance trends, discrepancies remain between simulated and measured runtimes. These deviations stem from both inherent limitations of the simulation environment and the restricted availability of detailed performance specifications from CPU manufacturers, which hinder precise configuration matching.</description>

      <title>6G Twin: Hybrid Gaussian Radio Fields for Channel Estimation and Non-Linear Precoder Design for Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces 6G Twin, the first end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-native radio access network (RAN) design that unifies (i) neural Gaussian Radio Fields (GRF) for compressed channel state information (CSI) acquisition, (ii) continual channel prediction with handover persistence, and (iii) an energy-optimal nonlinear precoder (minPMAC). GRF replaces dense pilots with a sparse Gaussian field, cutting pilot overhead by about 100x while delivering 1.1 ms inference and less than 2 minutes on-site training, thus enabling millisecond-scale closed-loop operation. A replay-driven continual learner sustains accuracy under mobility and cell transitions, improving channel normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 10 dB over frozen predictors and an additional 2-5 dB over uniform replay, thereby stabilizing performance across UMi/UMa handovers. Finally, minPMAC solves a convex, order-free MAC precoder design that recovers the globally optimal order from Broadcast Channel (BC) duals and minimizes transmit energy subject to minimum-rate guarantees, achieving 4-10 times lower energy (scenario dependent) with monotonically increasing bits per joule as SNR grows. This translates to up to 5 times higher data rate at comparable power or the same rates at substantially lower power. Together, these components form a practical, GPU-ready framework that attains real-time CSI, robust tracking in dynamic networks with efficient handovers, and state-of-the-art throughput-energy tradeoffs under 3GPP-style settings.</description>

      <title>On The Reproducibility Limitations of RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is increasingly employed in generative AI-driven scientific workflows to integrate rapidly evolving scientific knowledge bases, yet its reliability is frequently compromised by non-determinism in their retrieval components. This paper introduces ReproRAG, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically measure and quantify the reproducibility of vector-based retrieval systems. ReproRAG investigates sources of uncertainty across the entire pipeline, including different embedding models, precision, retrieval algorithms, hardware configurations, and distributed execution environments. Utilizing a suite of metrics, such as Exact Match Rate, Jaccard Similarity, and Kendall's Tau, the proposed framework effectively characterizes the trade-offs between reproducibility and performance. Our large-scale empirical study reveals critical insights; for instance, we observe that different embedding models have remarkable impact on RAG reproducibility. The open-sourced ReproRAG framework provides researchers and engineers productive tools to validate deployments, benchmark reproducibility, and make informed design decisions, thereby fostering more trustworthy AI for science.</description>

      <title>TD3-Sched: Learning to Orchestrate Container-based Cloud-Edge Resources via Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource scheduling in cloud-edge systems is challenging as edge nodes run latency-sensitive workloads under tight resource constraints, while existing centralized schedulers can suffer from performance bottlenecks and user experience degradation. To address the issues of distributed decisions in cloud-edge environments, we present TD3-Sched, a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for continuous control of CPU and memory allocation, which can achieve optimized decisions for resource provisioning under dynamic workloads. On a realistic cloud-edge testbed with SockShop application and Alibaba traces, TD3-Sched achieves reductions of 17.9% to 38.6% in latency under same loads compared with other reinforcement-learning and rule-based baselines, and 16% to 31.6% under high loads. TD3-Sched also shows superior Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance with only 0.47% violations. These results indicate faster convergence, lower latency, and more stable performance while preserving service quality in container-based cloud-edge environment compared with the baselines.</description>

      <title>Scheduler-Driven Job Atomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern GPU clusters, particularly those built on NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) architecture, often suffer from inefficiencies because jobs are treated as rigid, indivisible blocks that occupy a fixed slice until completion. The reliance on static peak memory estimates exacerbates fragmentation, underutilization, and job rejections. We propose Scheduler-Driven Job Atomization (SJA), a new paradigm that establishes a bidirectional interaction between scheduler and jobs. In SJA, the scheduler advertises available execution gaps, and jobs respond by signaling interest if they can potentially generate a subjob that fits the offered time-capacity window. The scheduler may collect multiple signals for the same slot and, based on its allocation policy (e.g., fairness, efficiency, or SLA priorities), selects which job is granted the slot. Only then does the chosen job materialize a safe, self-contained subjob tailored to that opportunity. Unlike migration or preemption, SJA proactively shapes workloads before execution, thereby avoiding costly state transfers and unpredictable interruptions. It aims to increase GPU utilization, reduce wait times, and minimize migration overhead by aligning jobs with opportunities in real time, ensuring that each admitted subjob is correct by construction. This paper is presented as a concept paper: it introduces the paradigm, defines its building blocks, and outlines future research directions, rather than offering a full experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>In-Transit Data Transport Strategies for Coupled AI-Simulation Workflow Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled AI-Simulation workflows are becoming the major workloads for HPC facilities, and their increasing complexity necessitates new tools for performance analysis and prototyping of new in-situ workflows. We present SimAI-Bench, a tool designed to both prototype and evaluate these coupled workflows. In this paper, we use SimAI-Bench to benchmark the data transport performance of two common patterns on the Aurora supercomputer: a one-to-one workflow with co-located simulation and AI training instances, and a many-to-one workflow where a single AI model is trained from an ensemble of simulations. For the one-to-one pattern, our analysis shows that node-local and DragonHPC data staging strategies provide excellent performance compared Redis and Lustre file system. For the many-to-one pattern, we find that data transport becomes a dominant bottleneck as the ensemble size grows. Our evaluation reveals that file system is the optimal solution among the tested strategies for the many-to-one pattern.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Content-Oblivious Leader Election on Oriented Asynchronous Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the leader election problem in oriented ring networks under content-oblivious asynchronous message-passing systems, where an adversary may arbitrarily corrupt message contents.
  Frei et al. (DISC 2024) presented a uniform terminating leader election algorithm for oriented rings in this setting, with message complexity $O(n \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\max})$ on a ring of size $n$, where $\mathsf{ID}_{\max}$ is the largest identifier in the system, this result has been recently extended by Chalopin et al. (DISC 2025) to unoriented rings.
  In this paper, we investigate the message complexity of leader election on ring networks in the content-oblivious model, showing that no uniform algorithm can solve the problem if each process is limited to sending a constant number of messages in one direction.
  Interestingly, this limitation hinges on the uniformity assumption. In the non-uniform setting, where processes know an upper bound $U \geq n$ on the ring size, we present an algorithm with message complexity $O(n \cdot U \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\min})$, in which each process sends $O(U \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\min})$ messages clockwise and only three messages counter-clockwise. Here, $\mathsf{ID}_{\min}$ is the smallest identifier in the system. This dependence on the identifiers compares favorably with the dependence on $\mathsf{ID}_{\max}$ of Frei et al.
  We also show a non-uniform algorithm where each process sends $O(U \cdot \log\mathsf{ID}_{\min})$ messages in one direction and $O(\log\mathsf{ID}_{\min})$ in the other. The factor $\log \mathsf{ID}_{\min}$ is optimal, matching the lower bound of Frei et al.
  Finally, in the anonymous setting, where processes do not have identifiers, we propose a randomized algorithm where each process sends only $O(\log^2 U)$ messages, with a success probability of $1 - U^{-c}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although originally developed primarily for artificial intelligence workloads, RISC-V-based accelerators are also emerging as attractive platforms for high-performance scientific computing. In this work, we present our approach to accelerating an astrophysical $N$-body code on the RISC-V-based Wormhole n300 card developed by Tenstorrent. Our results show that this platform can be highly competitive for astrophysical simulations employing this class of algorithms, delivering more than a $2 \times$ speedup and approximately $2 \times$ energy savings compared to a highly optimized CPU implementation of the same code.</description>

      <title>A Coopetitive-Compatible Data Generation Framework for Cross-silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals, making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model, analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Pareto-optimal Tradeoffs Between Communication and Computation with Flexible Gradient Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed optimization problems in non-i.i.d. scenarios, focusing on the interplay between communication and computation efficiency. To this end, we propose FlexGT, a flexible snapshot gradient tracking method with tunable numbers of local updates and neighboring communications in each round. Leveraging a unified convergence analysis framework, we prove that FlexGT achieves a linear or sublinear convergence rate depending on objective-specific properties--from (strongly) convex to nonconvex--and the above-mentioned tunable parameters. FlexGT is provably robust to the heterogeneity across nodes and attains the best-known communication and computation complexity among existing results. Moreover, we introduce an accelerated gossip-based variant, termed Acc-FlexGT, and show that with prior knowledge of the graph, it achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between communication and computation. Particularly, Acc-FlexGT achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( L/\epsilon +L\sigma ^2/\left( n\epsilon^2 \sqrt{1-\sqrt{\rho _W}} \right) \right) $ for the nonconvex case, matching the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor, and improves the existing results for the strongly convex case by a factor of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( 1/\sqrt{\epsilon} \right)$, where $\epsilon$ is the targeted accuracy, $n$ the number of nodes, $L$ the Lipschitz constant, $\rho_W$ the spectrum gap of the graph, and $\sigma$ the stochastic gradient variance. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Whack-a-Mole: Deterministic Packet Spraying Across Multiple Network Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Whack-a-Mole, a deterministic packet spraying algorithm for distributing packets across multiple network paths with provably tight discrepancy bounds. The algorithm is motivated by large-scale distributed AI/ML training and inference workloads, where collective completion time (CCT) and effective training time ratio (ETTR) are highly sensitive to tail latency and transport imbalance. Whack-a-Mole represents the path profile as a discrete allocation of $m$ selection units across $n$ paths and uses a bit-reversal counter to choose a path for each packet. We prove that the discrepancy between expected and actual packet counts per path is bounded by $O(\log m)$ over any contiguous packet sequence. The algorithm responds quickly to congestion feedback by reducing allocations to degraded paths and redistributing load to healthier ones. This combination of deterministic distribution, low per-packet overhead, and compatibility with erasure-coded transport makes Whack-a-Mole an effective building block for multipath transport protocols that aim to minimize CCT and maximize GPU utilization.</description>

      <title>FedFiTS: Fitness-Selected, Slotted Client Scheduling for Trustworthy Federated Learning in Healthcare AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability, and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL, making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.</description>

      <title>FedFusion: Federated Learning with Diversity- and Cluster-Aware Encoders for Robust Adaptation under Label Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning in practice must contend with heterogeneous feature spaces, severe non-IID data, and scarce labels across clients. We present FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn, DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes, FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation, domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust federated learning under real-world constraints.</description>

Abstract: With the development of Ethereum, numerous blockchains compatible with Ethereum's execution environment (i.e., Ethereum Virtual Machine, EVM) have emerged. Developers can leverage smart contracts to run various complex decentralized applications on top of blockchains. However, the increasing number of EVM-compatible blockchains has introduced significant challenges in cross-chain interoperability, particularly in ensuring efficiency and atomicity for the whole cross-chain application. Existing solutions are either limited in guaranteeing overall atomicity for the cross-chain application, or inefficient due to the need for multiple rounds of cross-chain smart contract execution. To address this gap, we propose IntegrateX, an efficient cross-chain interoperability system that ensures the overall atomicity of cross-chain smart contract invocations. The core idea is to deploy the logic required for cross-chain execution onto a single blockchain, where it can be executed in an integrated manner. This allows cross-chain applications to perform all cross-chain logic efficiently within the same blockchain. IntegrateX consists of a cross-chain smart contract deployment protocol and a cross-chain smart contract integrated execution protocol. The former achieves efficient and secure cross-chain deployment by decoupling smart contract logic from state, and employing an off-chain cross-chain deployment mechanism combined with on-chain cross-chain verification. The latter ensures atomicity of cross-chain invocations through a 2PC-based mechanism, and enhances performance through transaction aggregation and fine-grained state lock. We implement a prototype of IntegrateX. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it reduces up to 61.2% latency compared to the state-of-the-art baseline while maintaining low gas consumption.</description>

      <title>Robust DNN Partitioning and Resource Allocation Under Uncertain Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network (DNN) partitioning and data offloading can provide real-time task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Phantora: Maximizing Code Reuse in Simulation-based Machine Learning System Performance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) training workloads place substantial demands on both computational and communication resources. Consequently, accurate performance estimation has become increasingly critical for guiding system design decisions, such as the selection of parallelization strategies, cluster configurations, and hardware provisioning. Existing simulation-based performance estimation requires reimplementing the ML framework in a simulator, which demands significant manual effort and is hard to maintain as ML frameworks evolve rapidly.
  This paper introduces Phantora, a hybrid GPU cluster simulator designed for performance estimation of ML training workloads. Phantora executes unmodified ML frameworks as is within a distributed, containerized environment. Each container emulates the behavior of a GPU server in a large-scale cluster, while Phantora intercepts and simulates GPU- and communication-related operations to provide high-fidelity performance estimation. We call this approach hybrid simulation of ML systems, in contrast to traditional methods that simulate static workloads. The primary advantage of hybrid simulation is that it allows direct reuse of ML framework source code in simulation, avoiding the need for reimplementation. Our evaluation shows that Phantora provides accuracy comparable to static workload simulation while supporting three state-of-the-art LLM training frameworks out-of-the-box. In addition, Phantora operates on a single GPU, eliminating the need for the resource-intensive trace collection and workload extraction steps required by traditional trace-based simulators. Phantora is open-sourced at https://github.com/QDelta/Phantora.</description>

      <title>Speculative Decoding via Hybrid Drafting and Rollback-Aware Branch Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by employing a small draft model to propose draft tokens in advance, and validating them in parallel with the large target model. However, the existing SD methods still remain constrained by their serialized execution, which causes the mutual waiting bubbles between the draft and target models. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from branch prediction in modern processors and propose a novel framework \textbf{SpecBranch} to unlock branch parallelism in SD. Specifically, we first take an in-depth analysis of the potential of branch parallelism in SD, and recognize that the key challenge lies in the trade-offs between parallelization and token rollback. Based on the analysis, we introduce parallel speculative branches to preemptively hedge against likely rejections. Meanwhile, to enhance parallelism, we jointly orchestrate adaptive draft lengths with a hybrid combination of the implicit draft model confidence and explicit reusing of target model features. Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks show that SpecBranch achieves over \textbf{1.8}$\times \sim$ \textbf{4.5}$\times$ speedups against the auto-regressive decoding and reduces rollback tokens by $\textbf{50}$\% for poorly aligned models, while maintaining an identical sampling distribution.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Statistical Computing (HPSC): Challenges, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recognize the emergence of a statistical computing community focused on working with large computing platforms and producing software and applications that exemplify high-performance statistical computing (HPSC). The statistical computing (SC) community develops software that is widely used across disciplines. However, it remains largely absent from the high-performance computing (HPC) landscape, particularly on platforms such as those featured on the Top500 or Green500 lists. Many disciplines already participate in HPC, mostly centered around simulation science, although data-focused efforts under the artificial intelligence (AI) label are gaining popularity. Bridging this gap requires both community adaptation and technical innovation to align statistical methods with modern HPC technologies. We can accelerate progress in fast and scalable statistical applications by building strong connections between the SC and HPC communities. We present a brief history of SC, a vision for how its strengths can contribute to statistical science in the HPC environment (such as HPSC), the challenges that remain, and the opportunities currently available, culminating in a possible roadmap toward a thriving HPSC community.</description>

      <title>Towards the Distributed Large-scale k-NN Graph Construction by Graph Merge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to support the real-time interaction with LLMs and the instant search or the instant recommendation on social media, it becomes an imminent problem to build a k-NN graph or an indexing graph for the massive number of vectorized multimedia data. In such scenarios, the scale of the data or the scale of the graph may exceed the processing capacity of a single machine. This paper aims to address the graph construction problem of such scale via efficient graph merge. For the graph construction on a single node, two generic and highly parallelizable algorithms, namely Two-way Merge and Multi-way Merge are proposed to merge subgraphs into one. For the graph construction across multiple nodes, a multi-node procedure based on Two-way Merge is presented. The procedure makes it feasible to construct a large-scale k-NN graph/indexing graph on either a single node or multiple nodes when the data size exceeds the memory capacity of one node. Extensive experiments are conducted on both large-scale k-NN graph and indexing graph construction. For the k-NN graph construction, the large-scale and high-quality k-NN graphs are constructed by graph merge in parallel. Typically, a billion-scale k-NN graph can be built in approximately 17h when only three nodes are employed. For the indexing graph construction, similar NN search performance as the original indexing graph is achieved with the merged indexing graphs while requiring much less time of construction.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Interactive Workflow Provenance: Reference Architecture and Evaluation Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on workflows that process data across the Edge, Cloud, and High Performance Computing (HPC) continuum. Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.</description>

      <title>Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.</description>

      <title>MVDRAM: Enabling GeMV Execution in Unmodified DRAM for Low-Bit LLM Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General matrix-vector multiplication (GeMV) remains a critical latency bottleneck in large language model (LLM) inference, even with quantized low-bit models. Processing-Using-DRAM (PUD), an analog in-DRAM computing technique, has the potential to repurpose on-device DRAM as a GeMV engine, offering additional high-throughput processing capabilities to widespread consumer devices without DRAM modifications. However, applying PUD to GeMV operations in the LLM inference pipeline incurs significant overheads $\textit{before}$ and $\textit{after}$ in-DRAM computation, diminishing the benefits of its high-throughput processing capabilities.
  This paper presents MVDRAM, the first practical system to accelerate GeMV operations for low-bit LLM inference using unmodified DRAM. By leveraging the data sharing patterns and mathematical linearity in GeMV operations, MVDRAM orchestrates the processor and DRAM to eliminate the costs associated with pre-arranging inputs and bit-transposition of outputs required in conventional PUD approaches. Our experimental evaluation with four DDR4 DRAM modules shows that MVDRAM achieves comparable or even better inference speed than the processor-based implementation for GeMV operations in low-bit (under 4-bit) LLM. In particular, MVDRAM achieves up to 7.29$\times$ speedup and 30.5$\times$ energy efficiency for low-bit GeMV operations. For end-to-end LLM inference, MVDRAM achieves 2.18$\times$ and 1.31$\times$ throughput improvements, along with 3.04$\times$ and 2.35$\times$ energy efficiency, for 2-bit and 4-bit quantized low-bit models, respectively. MVDRAM has the potential to redefine the AI hardware landscape by demonstrating the feasibility of standard DRAM as an LLM accelerator.</description>

      <title>MetaFed: Advancing Privacy, Performance, and Sustainability in Federated Metaverse Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.</description>
