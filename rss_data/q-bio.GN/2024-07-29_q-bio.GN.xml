      <title>PyamilySeq: A Python Tool for Interpretable Gene (Re)Clustering and Pangenomic Inference Across Species and Genera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PyamilySeq is a Python-based tool designed for interpretable gene clustering and pangenomic inference, supporting analyses at both species and genus levels. It facilitates the clustering of gene sequences into families based on sequence similarity using CD-HIT, and can take the output of tried-and-tested sequence clustering tools such as CD-HIT, BLAST, DIAMOND, and MMseqs2. PyamilySeq is distinctive in its ability to integrate new sequences into existing clusters, providing a robust framework for iterative analysis while preserving the original clusters, useful when reannotating genomes. In addition to the standard Species mode which as with other tools performs core-gene analysis across a species range, PyamilySeq can be run in Genus mode where it detects the presence of gene families shared across multiple genera. These features enhance the tools applicability for ongoing and past genomic studies and comparative analyses. PyamilySeq generates comprehensive outputs, including gene presence-absence matrices and aligned sequence data, enabling downstream analysis and interpretation of the identified gene groups and pangenomic data.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric independence tests in high-dimensional settings, with applications to the genetics of complex disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [PhD thesis of FCP.] Nowadays, genetics studies large amounts of very diverse variables. Mathematical statistics has evolved in parallel to its applications, with much recent interest high-dimensional settings. In the genetics of human common disease, a number of relevant problems can be formulated as tests of independence. We show how defining adequate premetric structures on the support spaces of the genetic data allows for novel approaches to such testing. This yields a solid theoretical framework, which reflects the underlying biology, and allows for computationally-efficient implementations. For each problem, we provide mathematical results, simulations and the application to real data.</description>

      <title>Shotgun DNA sequencing for human identification: Dynamic SNP selection and likelihood ratio calculations accounting for errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In forensic genetics, short tandem repeats (STRs) are used for human identification (HID). Degraded biological trace samples with low amounts of short DNA fragments (low-quality DNA samples) pose a challenge for STR typing. Predefined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be amplified on short PCR fragments and used to generate SNP profiles from low-quality DNA samples. However, the stochastic results from low-quality DNA samples may result in frequent locus drop-outs and insufficient numbers of SNP genotypes for convincing identification of individuals. Shotgun DNA sequencing potentially analyses all DNA fragments in a sample in contrast to the targeted PCR-based sequencing methods and may be applied to DNA samples of very low quality, like heavily compromised crime-scene samples and ancient DNA samples. Here, we developed a statistical model for shotgun sequencing, sequence alignment, and genotype calling. Results from replicated shotgun sequencing of buccal swab (high-quality samples) and hair samples (low-quality samples) were arranged in a genotype-call confusion matrix to estimate the calling error probability by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. We developed formulas for calculating the evidential weight as a likelihood ratio (LR) based on data from dynamically selected SNPs from shotgun DNA sequencing. The method accounts for potential genotyping errors. Different genotype quality filters may be applied to account for genotyping errors. An error probability of zero resulted in the forensically commonly used LR formula. When considering a single SNP marker's contribution to the LR, error probabilities larger than zero reduced the LR contribution of matching genotypes and increased the LR in the case of a mismatch. We developed an open-source R package, wgsLR, which implements the method, including estimating the calling error probability and calculating LR values.</description>

      <title>Making Multi-Axis Gaussian Graphical Models Scalable to Millions of Samples and Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian graphical models can be used to extract conditional dependencies between the features of the dataset. This is often done by making an independence assumption about the samples, but this assumption is rarely satisfied in reality. However, state-of-the-art approaches that avoid this assumption are not scalable, with $O(n^3)$ runtime and $O(n^2)$ space complexity. In this paper, we introduce a method that has $O(n^2)$ runtime and $O(n)$ space complexity, without assuming independence.
  We validate our model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that our method's accuracy is comparable to that of prior work We demonstrate that our approach can be used on unprecedentedly large datasets, such as a real-world 1,000,000-cell scRNA-seq dataset; this was impossible with previous approaches. Our method maintains the flexibility of prior work, such as the ability to handle multi-modal tensor-variate datasets and the ability to work with data of arbitrary marginal distributions. An additional advantage of our method is that, unlike prior work, our hyperparameters are easily interpretable.</description>

      <title>DiMA: Sequence Diversity Dynamics Analyser for Viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence diversity is one of the major challenges in the design of diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against viruses. DiMA is a novel tool that is big data-ready and designed to facilitate the dissection of sequence diversity dynamics for viruses. DiMA stands out from other diversity analysis tools by offering various unique features. DiMA provides a quantitative overview of sequence (nucleotide/protein) diversity by use of Shannon's entropy corrected for size bias, applied via a user-defined k-mer sliding window to an input alignment file, and each k-mer position is dissected to various diversity motifs. The motifs are defined based on the probability of distinct sequences at a given k-mer position, whereby an index is the predominant sequence, while all the others are (total) variants to the index. The total variants are sub-classified into the major (most common) variant, minor variants (occurring more than once and of frequency lower than the major), and the unique (singleton) variants. DiMA allows user-defined, sequence metadata enrichment for analyses of the motifs. The application of DiMA was demonstrated for the alignment data of the relatively conserved Spike protein (2,106,985 sequences) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the relatively highly diverse Pol protein (3,874) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). The tool is publicly available as a web server (https://dima.bezmialem.edu.tr), as a Python library (via PyPi) and as a command line client (Via GitHub).</description>
