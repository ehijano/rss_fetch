      <title>Seismic wavefield solutions via physics-guided generative neural operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current neural operators often struggle to generalize to complex, out-of-distribution conditions, limiting their ability in seismic wavefield representation. To address this, we propose a generative neural operator (GNO) that leverages generative diffusion models (GDMs) to learn the underlying statistical distribution of scattered wavefields while incorporating a physics-guided sampling process at each inference step. This physics guidance enforces wave equation-based constraints corresponding to specific velocity models, driving the iteratively generated wavefields toward physically consistent solutions. By training the diffusion model on wavefields corresponding to a diverse dataset of velocity models, frequencies, and source positions, our GNO enables to rapidly synthesize high-fidelity wavefields at inference time. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our GNO not only produces accurate wavefields matching numerical reference solutions, but also generalizes effectively to previously unseen velocity models and frequencies.</description>

      <title>Strong noise attenuation of seismic data based on Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data acquisition is often affected by various types of noise, which degrade data quality and hinder subsequent interpretation. Recovery of seismic data becomes particularly challenging in the presence of strong noise, which significantly impacts both data accuracy and geological analysis. This study proposes a novel single-encoder, multiple-decoder network based on Nash equalization (SEMD-Nash) for effective strong noise attenuation in seismic data. The main contributions of this method are as follows: First, we design a shared encoder-multi-decoder architecture, where an improved encoder extracts key features from the noisy data, and three parallel decoders reconstruct the denoised seismic signal from different perspectives. Second, we develop a multi-objective optimization system that integrates three loss functions-Mean Squared Error (MSE), Perceived Loss, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)-to ensure effective signal reconstruction, high-order feature preservation, and structural integrity. Third, we introduce the Nash Equalization Weight Optimizer, which dynamically adjusts the weights of the loss functions, balancing the optimization objectives to improve the models robustness and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses strong noise while preserving the geological characteristics of the seismic data.</description>

      <title>Coal Strength with Dewatering and Coal Seam Gas Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06561v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the response of coal mechanical properties to dewatering and gas depletion is critical for estimating borehole stability and designing infill coal seam gas (CSG) wells. Despite its importance, the full impact of these processes on coal strength remains little explored. This study aims to quantify these effects through a combination of results from micro-CT imaging, sonic testing, and mechanical testing on coal samples. Micro-CT imaging provides insights into coal's internal structure by focusing on parameters such as fracture porosity and fracture intensity (P32 factor). Sonic testing measures dynamic properties, including P-wave, S-wave velocities (Vp and Vs) and dynamic Young's modulus (Ed), under both dry and wet conditions. Mechanical testing with acoustic emission (AE) monitoring evaluates static properties like Young's modulus (Es) and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). The key findings are: (i) Micro-CT imaging shows a strong correlation between coal fracture porosity and P32, offering detailed insights into the coal micro-structure; (ii) mechanical testing reveals that dry samples exhibit a 10% higher Es and 31% greater UCS than wet samples, suggesting that dewatering increases coal strength but potentially also promotes embrittlement; and (iii) wet samples show higher Vp and Ed in sonic tests, indicating water saturation significantly influences sonic measurements. These findings improve the understanding of dewatering and gas depletion effects, laying the groundwork for more advanced geomechanical models in coal seam gas (CSG) operations.</description>

      <title>A phase-field model for quasi-dynamic rupture nucleation and propagation of in-plane faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling of faulting processes is an essential tool for understanding earthquake mechanics but remains challenging due to the structural and material complexities of fault zones. The phase-field method has recently enabled unified modeling of fault propagation and off-fault damage; however, its capability has been restricted to simplified anti-plane settings. In this study, we extend the phase-field method to in-plane faulting by introducing two key advancements: (i) the incorporation of enhanced fault kinematics and pressure-dependent shear strength for a more accurate representation of fault behavior, and (ii) a revised fault propagation criterion that explicitly accounts for the coupling between shear strength and normal stress. The proposed formulation is verified against standard discontinuous approaches to quasi-dynamic fault rupture under in-plane conditions and validated using experimental observations and numerical data on fault nucleation and propagation. Simulations incorporating structural complexities and material heterogeneities demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the phase-field model, establishing it as a powerful tool for investigating the interactions between fault zone properties and earthquake processes.</description>

      <title>Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first develop an operational approach for SST retrieval from the TIRS sensor, and subsequently propose a novel algorithm for establishing daily SST climatology which serves as the baseline to detect anomalous SST events. We applied the proposed methods to temperate coastal waters in South Australia for the ten-year period from 2014 to 2023. For ground validation purposes, a buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to record in-situ time-series SST. The spatiotemporal patterns of SST in the study area were analysed based on the ten years of satellite-derived SST imagery. The daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events during the study period of 2014-2023. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data, generated with the proposed algorithm, aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months.</description>

      <title>A Simple Sonic Mapping Method Verified by CT Scan Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel sonic mapping method applied to coal samples, verified by CT scan imaging. Cubic coal samples with side lengths of 50-70 mm were subjected to non-destructive sonic tests, measuring both P-wave (Vp) and S-wave (Vs) velocities. Each of the three orthogonal directions (X, Y, and Z) of the cube was divided into 9 regions, resulting in 27 Vp and 27 Vs measurements per sample. From these data, 2D sonic maps were constructed for each direction, and interpolation was employed to refine the mappings. A 3D sonic map was then generated by averaging the 2D maps. The 3D sonic mapping results were compared and validated against high-resolution CT scan images, confirming the reliability of this approach for mapping the internal structure of coal samples.</description>

      <title>European supercell thunderstorms -- an underestimated current threat and an increasing future hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercell thunderstorms are the most hazardous thunderstorm category and particularly impactful to society. Their monitoring is challenging and often confined to the radar networks of single countries. By exploiting kilometer-scale climate simulations, a first-of-its-kind characterization of supercell occurrence in Europe is derived for the current and a warmer climate. Despite previous notions of supercells being uncommon in Europe, the model shows ~700 supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are co-located with complex topography e.g. the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps with minima over the oceans and flat areas. Contrasting a current-climate simulation with a pseudo-global-warming +3$^\circ$C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11 %. However, there is a spatial dipole of change with strong increases in supercell frequencies in central and eastern Europe and a decrease in frequency over the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France.</description>

      <title>Reducing Frequency Bias of Fourier Neural Operators in 3D Seismic Wavefield Simulations Through Multi-Stage Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of Neural Operator (NeurOp) learning for solutions to the elastic wave equation shows promising results and provides the basis for fast large-scale simulations for different seismological applications. In this paper, we use the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model to directly solve the 3D Helmholtz wave equation for fast seismic ground motion simulations on different frequencies, and show the frequency bias of the FNO model, i.e. it learns the lower frequencies better comparing to the higher frequencies. To reduce the frequency bias, we adopt the multi-stage FNO training, i.e., after training a 1st stage FNO model for estimating the ground motion, we use a second FNO model as the 2nd stage to learn from the residual, which greatly reduced the errors on the higher frequencies. By adopting this multi-stage training, the FNO models show reduced biases on higher frequencies, which enhanced the overall results of the ground motion simulations. Thus the multi-stage training FNO improves the accuracy and realism of the ground motion simulations.</description>

      <title>A decade of the fast-varying ionospheric and magnetospheric magnetic fields from ground and multi-satellite observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-varying geomagnetic field is a superposition of contributions from multiple internal and external current systems. A major source of geomagnetic variations at periods less than a few years are current systems external to the solid Earth, namely the ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, as well as associated induced currents. The separation of these three sources is mathematically underdetermined using either ground or satellite measurements alone, but becomes tractable when the two datasets are combined. Based on this concept, we developed a new geomagnetic field modelling approach that allows us to simultaneously characterise the mid-latitude ionospheric, magnetospheric and the internal induced magnetic fields using ground and satellite observations for all local times and magnetic conditions, and without prescribing any harmonic behaviour on these current systems in time, as is typical in other models. By applying this new method to a 10-year dataset of ground observatory and multi-satellite measurements from 2014 to 2023, we obtained the time series of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the ionospheric, magnetospheric and induced fields. These new time series allow the study of complex non-periodic dynamics of the external magnetic fields during global geomagnetic storms, as well as periodicities in the magnetospheric coefficients linked to solar activities and periodic ionospheric magnetic fields linked to lunar daily variations, contributing to a more complete picture of the dynamics of the external currents and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, and facilitating more accurate space weather nowcast and forecast. Finally, the new approach allows for a better characterisation of internal induced field sources, leading to higher quality electromagnetic transfer functions.</description>

      <title>Simulation and modelling of convective mixing of carbon dioxide in geological formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform large-scale numerical simulations of convection in 3D porous media at Rayleigh-Darcy numbers up to $Ra=8\times10^4$. To investigate the convective mixing of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in geological formations, we consider a semi-infinite domain, where the CO$_2$ concentration is constant at the top and no flux is prescribed at bottom. Convection begins with a diffusion-dominated phase, transitions to convection-driven solute finger growth, and ends with a shutdown stage as fingers reach the bottom boundary and the concentration in the system increases. For $Ra \ge 5\times10^3$, we observe a constant-flux regime with dissolution flux stabilizing at 0.019, approximately 13\% higher than in 2D estimates. Finally, we provide a simple and yet accurate physical model describing the mass of solute entering the system throughout the whole mixing process. These findings extend solutal convection insights to 3D and high-$Ra$, improving the reliability of tools predicting the long-term CO$_2$ dynamics in the subsurface.</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the ``return stroke''-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed `Main pulse' shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component-type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a unique mode of charge transfer with a range of junction length-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>
