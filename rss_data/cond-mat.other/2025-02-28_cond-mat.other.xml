      <title>Landau levels for discrete-time quantum walks in artificial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4337</link>
      <description>arXiv:1412.4337v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new family of 2D discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) is presented and shown to coincide, in the continuous limit, with the Dirac dynamics of a spin 1/2 fermion coupled to a constant and uniform magnetic field. Landau levels are constructed, not only in the continuous limit, but also for the DTQWs i.e. for finite non-vanishing values of the time- and position-step, by a perturbative approach in the step. Numerical simulations support the above results and suggest that the magnetic interpretation is valid beyond the scope of the continuous limit. The possibility of quantum simulation of condensed-matter systems by DTQWs is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and discrete Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:1508.00038v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A particular example is produced to prove that quantum walks can be used to simulate full-fledged discrete gauge theories. A new family of $2D$ walks is introduced and its continuous limit is shown to coincide with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic interpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these DTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and possess a discrete gauge-invariant conserved current. A discrete gauge-invariant electromagnetic field is also constructed and that field is coupled to the conserved current by a discrete generalization of Maxwell equations. The dynamics of the DTQWs under crossed electric and magnetic fields is finally explored outside the continuous limit by numerical simulations. Bloch oscillations and the so-called ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift are recovered in the weak-field limit. Localization is observed for some values of the gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks and non-Abelian discrete gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.01605v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new family of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on the line with an exact discrete $U(N)$ gauge invariance is introduced. It is shown that the continuous limit of these DTQWs, when it exists, coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to usual $U(N)$ gauge fields in $2D$ spacetime. A discrete generalization of the usual $U(N)$ curvature is also constructed. An alternate interpretation of these results in terms of superimposed $U(1)$ Maxwell fields and $SU(N)$ gauge fields is discussed in the Appendix. Numerical simulations are also presented, which explore the convergence of the DTQWs towards their continuous limit and which also compare the DTQWs with classical (i.e. non-quantum) motions in classical $SU(2)$ fields. The results presented in this article constitute a first step towards quantum simulations of generic Yang-Mills gauge theories through DTQWs.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time quantum walks as fermions of lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.08303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that discrete-time quantum walks can be used to digitize, i.e., to time discretize fermionic models of continuous-time lattice gauge theory. The resulting discrete-time dynamics is thus not only manifestly unitary, but also ultralocal, i.e. the particle's speed is upper bounded, as in standard relativistic quantum field theories. The lattice chiral symmetry of staggered fermions, which corresponds to a translational invariance, is lost after the requirement of ultralocality of the evolution; this fact is an instance of Meyer's 1996 no-go lemma stating that no non-trivial one-dimensional scalar quantum cellular automaton can be translationally invariant [1]. All results are presented in a single-particle framework and for a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic lattice gauge invariance in two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.04488v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is one of the more important concepts in physics. We discuss this concept in connection with the unitary evolution of discrete-time quantum walks in one and two spatial dimensions, when they include the interaction with synthetic, external electromagnetic fields. One introduces this interaction as additional phases that play the role of gauge fields. Here, we present a way to incorporate those phases, which differs from previous works. Our proposal allows the discrete derivatives, that appear under a gauge transformation, to treat time and space on the same footing, in a way which is similar to standard lattice gauge theories. By considering two steps of the evolution, we define a density current which is gauge invariant and conserved. In the continuum limit, the dynamics of the particle, under a suitable choice of the parameters, becomes the Dirac equation, and the conserved current satisfies the corresponding conservation equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of quantum relativistic diffusion via quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.09791v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two models are first presented, of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) with temporal noise on the internal degree of freedom (i.e., the coin): (i) a model with both a coin-flip and a phase-flip channel, and (ii) a model with random coin unitaries. It is then shown that both these models admit a common limit in the spacetime continuum, namely, a Lindblad equation with Dirac-fermion Hamiltonian part and, as Lindblad jumps, a chirality flip and a chirality-dependent phase flip, which are two of the three standard error channels for a two-level quantum system. This, as one may call it, Dirac Lindblad equation, provides a model of quantum relativistic spatial diffusion, which is evidenced both analytically and numerically. This model of spatial diffusion has the intriguing specificity of making sense only with original unitary models which are relativistic in the sense that they have chirality, on which the noise is introduced: The diffusion arises via the by-construction (quantum) coupling of chirality to the position. For a particle with vanishing mass, the model of quantum relativistic diffusion introduced in the present work, reduces to the well-known telegraph equation, which yields propagation at short times, diffusion at long times, and exhibits no quantumness. Finally, the results are extended to temporal noises which depend smoothly on position.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks in weak electric fields and Bloch oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.05346v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations appear when an electric field is superimposed on a quantum particle that evolves on a lattice with a tight-binding Hamiltonian (TBH), i.e., evolves via what we will call an electric TBH; this phenomenon will be referred to as TBH Bloch oscillations. A similar phenomenon is known to show up in so-called electric discrete-time quantum walks (DQWs); this phenomenon will be referred to as DQW Bloch oscillations. This similarity is particularly salient when the electric field of the DQW is weak. For a wide, i.e., spatially extended initial condition, one numerically observes semi-classical oscillations, i.e., oscillations of a localized particle, both for the electric TBH and the electric DQW. More precisely: The numerical simulations strongly suggest that the semi-classical DQW Bloch oscillations correspond to two counter-propagating semi-classical TBH Bloch oscillations. In this work it is shown that, under certain assumptions, the solution of the electric DQW for a weak electric field and a wide initial condition is well approximated by the superposition of two continuous-time expressions, which are counter-propagating solutions of an electric TBH whose hopping amplitude is the cosine of the arbitrary coin-operator mixing angle. In contrast, if one wishes the continuous-time approximation to hold for spatially localized initial conditions, one needs at least the DQW to be lazy, as suggested by numerical simulations and by the fact that this has been proven in the case of a vanishing electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12314v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spacetime discretization of the Dirac equation that has the form of a quantum automaton and that is invariant upon changing the representation of the Clifford algebra, as the Dirac equation itself. Our derivation follows Dirac's original one: We required that the square of the discrete Dirac scheme be what we define as an acceptable discretization of the Klein-Gordon equation. Contrary to standard lattice gauge theory in discrete time, in which unitarity needs to be proven, we show that the quantum automaton delivers naturally unitary Wilson fermions for any choice of Wilson's parameter.</description>

      <title>A single-particle framework for unitary lattice gauge theory in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14997v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a real-time lattice-gauge-theory-type action for a spin-1/2 matter field of a single particle on a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime lattice. The framework is based on a discrete-time quantum walk, and is hence inherently unitary and strictly local, i.e., transition amplitudes exactly vanish outside of a lightcone on the lattice. We then provide a lattice Noether's theorem for internal symmetries of this action. We further couple this action to an electromagnetic field by a minimal substitution on the lattice. Finally, we suggest a real-time lattice-gauge-theory-type action for the electromagnetic field in arbitrary spacetime dimensions, and derive its classical equations of motion, which are lattice versions of Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum spatial search with electric potential : long-time dynamics and robustness to noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present various results on the scheme introduced , which is a quantum spatial-search algorithm on a two-dimensional (2D) square spatial grid, realized with a 2D Dirac discrete-time quantum walk (DQW) coupled to a Coulomb electric field centered on the marked node. In such a walk, the electric term acts as the oracle of the algorithm, and the free walk (i.e., without electric term) acts as the "diffusion" part, as it is called in Grover's algorithm. The results are the following. First, we run simulations of this electric Dirac DQW during longer times than explored in Ref.\ \cite{ZD21}, and observe that there is a second localization peak around the node marked by the oracle, reached in a time $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of the 2D grid, with a localization probability scaling as $O(1/\ln N)$. This matches the state-of-the-art 2D DQW search algorithms before amplitude amplification. We then study the effect of adding noise on the Coulomb potential, and observe that the walk, especially the second localization peak, is highly robust to spatial noise, more modestly robust to spatiotemporal noise, and that the first localization peak is even highly robust to spatiotemporal noise.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Quantum Phase Difference Estimation Algorithm to the Excitation Energies in Spin Systems on a NISQ Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Phase Difference Estimation (QPDE) algorithm, as an extension of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), is a quantum algorithm designed to compute the differences of two eigenvalues of a unitary operator by exploiting the quantum superposition of two eigenstates. Unlike QPE, QPDE is free of controlled-unitary operations, and is suitable for calculations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We present the implementation and verification of a novel early fault-tolerant QPDE algorithm for determining energy gaps across diverse spin system configurations using NISQ devices. The algorithm is applied to the systems described by two and three-spin Heisenberg Hamiltonians with different geometric arrangements and coupling strengths, including symmetric, asymmetric, spin-frustrated, and non-frustrated configurations. By leveraging the match gate-like structure of the time evolution operator of Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we achieve constant-depth quantum circuits suitable for NISQ hardware implementation. Our results on IBM quantum processors show remarkable accuracy ranging from 85\% to 93\%, demonstrating excellent agreement with classical calculations even in the presence of hardware noise. The methodology incorporates sophisticated quantum noise suppression techniques, including Pauli Twirling and Dynamical Decoupling, and employs an adaptive framework. Our findings demonstrate the practical viability of the QPDE algorithm for quantum many-body simulations on current NISQ hardware, establishing a robust framework for future applications.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallic Fe/MgO Superlattice: An Ideal Candidate for Magnetic Tunnel Junction Electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) based Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is poised to replace embedded Flash for advanced applications such as automotive microcontroller units. To achieve deeper technological adoption, MTJ needs to exhibit three key features: low magnetization (Ms), high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). Here, we theoretically show that when Fe/MgO multilayers are inserted into the fixed and free layers of the MTJ, these three conditions are simultaneously met. As the number of Fe/MgO multilayers in MTJ electrodes is increased, we find that the electron transport evolves from direct barrier tunneling of majority spin states to the resonant tunneling of minority spin states. Remarkably, the projected density of states (PDOS) of Fe/MgO superlattice at the MgO tunnel barrier exhibits half-metallicity near the Fermi Energy, where the minority states exist while the majority states are gapped out, resulting in astronomically high TMR.</description>

      <title>Flux induced re-entrant dynamics in the quantum walk of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the QW of two interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder lattice in the presence of an artificial magnetic field. By considering an uniform flux piercing through the ladder, we show that in the limit of strong onsite repulsion and dominant rung-hopping, an initially slow dynamics becomes fast, then slow and fast again with increase in the flux strength indicating a re-entrant dynamics. This unusual behaviour is found to be associated with the formation, breaking and reformation of a bound pair state along the rung of the ladder. In addition to this we also find a re-entrant behaviour in the chiral dynamics where the chirality in the system first increases and then decreases with increase in interaction. We establish this unusual re-entrant behaviour in the dynamics by analysing the radial velocity, spreading of correlation, center-of-mass shearing and energy band diagrams.</description>
