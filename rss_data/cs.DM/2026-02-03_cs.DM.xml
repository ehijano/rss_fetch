      <title>Facet-Defining Inequalities for the Angle-Based DC Optimal Transmission Switching Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The switching of transmission lines can significantly improve the economic and operational efficiency of power systems. The Direct-Current Optimal Transmission Switching (DC-OTS) problem provides a formal framework for minimizing power generation costs by reconfiguring the transmission network topology under a linearized power flow model. DC-OTS is typically formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates disjunctive constraints to capture the required relationships between certain variables via big-M parameters. More specifically, these parameters represent upper bounds on voltage angle differences across non-operational transmission lines. In practice, overly conservative (and arbitrary) bounds tend to be used. The belief is that tightening these values requires the solution of the computationally intractable longest path problem. This work challenges that view through a novel polyhedral analysis of the angle-based DC-OTS formulation. We construct an extended formulation for the convex hull of an angle-based relaxation and derive facet-defining inequalities that tighten angle-difference bounds.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Temporal Motifs and Doubling Time in Random Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study two natural models of \textit{random temporal} graphs. In the first, the \textit{continuous} model, each edge $e$ is assigned $l_e$ labels, each drawn uniformly at random from $(0,1]$, where the numbers $l_e$ are independent random variables following the same discrete probability distribution. In the second, the \textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\{1,2,\ldots,T\}$. In both models we study the existence of \textit{$\delta$-temporal motifs}. Here a $\delta$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\mathcal{G}=(G,\lambda)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $\delta$-temporal motif if $\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $\delta$. We prove \textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $\delta$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $\delta$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion. We prove \textit{sharp upper and lower bounds} for the maximum doubling time in the continuous model.</description>

      <title>Non-Clashing Teaching in Graphs: Algorithms, Complexity, and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and proved that it is the most efficient batch machine teaching model satisfying the collusion-avoidance benchmark established in the seminal work of Goldman and Mathias [COLT 1993]. Recently, (positive) non-clashing teaching was thoroughly studied for balls in graphs, yielding numerous algorithmic and combinatorial results. In particular, Chalopin et al. [COLT 2024] and Ganian et al. [ICLR 2025] gave an almost complete picture of the complexity landscape of the positive variant, showing that it is tractable only for restricted graph classes due to the non-trivial nature of the problem and concept class.
  In this work, we consider (positive) non-clashing teaching for closed neighborhoods in graphs. This concept class is not only extensively studied in various related contexts, but it also exhibits broad generality, as any finite binary concept class can be equivalently represented by a set of closed neighborhoods in a graph. In comparison to the works on balls in graphs, we provide improved algorithmic results, notably including FPT algorithms for more general classes of parameters, and we complement these results by deriving stronger lower bounds. Lastly, we obtain combinatorial upper bounds for wider classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Fanciful Figurines flip Free Flood-It -- Polynomial-Time Miniature Painting on Co-gem-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the eponymous hobby, we introduce Miniature Painting as the computational problem to paint a given graph $G=(V,E)$ according to a prescribed template $t \colon V \rightarrow C$, which assigns colors $C$ to the vertices of $G$. In this setting, the goal is to realize the template using a shortest possible sequence of brush strokes, where each stroke overwrites a connected vertex subset with a color in $C$. We show that this problem is equivalent to a reversal of the well-studied Free Flood-It game, in which a colored graph is decolored into a single color using as few moves as possible. This equivalence allows known complexity results for Free Flood-It to be transferred directly to Miniature Painting, including NP-hardness under severe structural restrictions, such as when $G$ is a grid, a tree, or a split graph. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm for Miniature Painting on graphs that are free of induced co-gems, a graph class that strictly generalizes cographs. As a direct consequence, Free Flood-It is also polynomial-time solvable on co-gem-free graphs, independent of the initial coloring.</description>

      <title>Trees with maximum $\sigma$-irregularity under a prescribed maximum degree 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sigma-irregularity index $\sigma(G) = \sum_{uv \in E(G)} (d_G(u) - d_G(v))^2$ measures the total degree imbalance along the edges of a graph. We study extremal problems for $\sigma(T)$ within the class of trees of fixed order $n$ and bounded maximum degree $\Delta = 6$. Using a penalty-function framework combined with handshake identities and congruence arguments, we determine the exact maximum value of $\sigma(T)$ for every residue class of $n$ modulo $6$, showing that the possible minimum values of the penalty function are $0, 10, 20, 22, 30,$ and $40$. For each case, we provide a complete characterization of all maximizing trees in terms of degree counts and edge multiplicities. In five of the six residue classes, all extremal trees contain only vertices of degrees $1, 2,$ and $6$, while for $n \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$ an additional exceptional family arises involving vertices of degree $3$. These results extend earlier work on sigma-irregularity for smaller degree bounds and illustrate the rapidly growing combinatorial complexity of the problem as the maximum degree increases.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of algorithms for set partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Set partitions are arrangements of distinct objects into groups. The problem of listing all set partitions arises in a variety of settings, in particular in combinatorial optimization tasks. After a brief review, we give practical approximate formulas for determining the number of set partitions, both for small and large set sizes. Several algorithms for enumerating all set partitions are reviewed, and benchmarking tests were conducted. The algorithm of Djokic et al. is recommended for practical use.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Matching (Conjecture) Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the tree-decomposition-based parameter totally $\Delta$-modular treewidth (TDM-treewidth) for matrices with two nonzero entries per row. We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing high-bandwidth graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An unweighted, undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes is said to have \emph{bandwidth} at most $k$ if its nodes can be labelled from $0$ to $n - 1$ such that no two adjacent nodes have labels that differ by more than $k$. It is known that one can decide whether the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $k$ in $O(n^k)$ time and $O(n^k)$ space using dynamic programming techniques. For small $k$ close to $0$, this approach is effectively polynomial, but as $k$ scales with $n$, it becomes superexponential, requiring up to $O(n^{n - 1})$ time (where $n - 1$ is the maximum possible bandwidth). In this paper, we reformulate the problem in terms of bipartite matching for sufficiently large $k \ge \lfloor (n - 1)/2 \rfloor$, allowing us to use Hall's marriage theorem to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(n^{n - k + 1})$ time and $O(n)$ auxiliary space (beyond storage of the input graph). This yields polynomial complexity for large $k$ close to $n - 1$, demonstrating that the bandwidth recognition problem is solvable in polynomial time whenever either $k$ or $n - k$ remains small.</description>

      <title>The price of homogeneity is polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide explicit and polynomial bounds for the Homogeneous Wall Lemma which occurred for the first time implicitly in the $13$th entry of Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minors Series [JCTB 1990] and has since become a cornerstone in the algorithmic theory of graph minors.
  A wall where each brick is assigned a set of colours is said to be homogeneous if each brick is assigned the same set of colours. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma says that there exists a function $h$ that, given non-negative integers $q$ and $k$ and an $h(q,k)$-wall $W$ where each brick is assigned a, possibly empty, subset of $\{ 1, \ldots , q \}$ contains a $k$-wall $W'$ as a subgraph such that, if one assigns to each brick $B$ of $W'$ the union of the sets assigned to the bricks of $W$ in its interior, then $W'$ is homogeneous. It is well-known that $h(q,k) \in k^{\mathcal{O}(q)}$. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma plays a key role in most applications of the Irrelevant Vertex Technique where an exponential dependency of $h$ on $q$ usually causes non-uniform dependencies on meta-parameters at best and additional exponential blow-ups at worst. By proving that $h(q,k) \in \mathcal{O}(q^4 \cdot k^6)$, we provide a positive answer to a problem raised by Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020].</description>

      <title>$m$-Eternal Dominating Set Problem on Subclasses of Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph G(V, E) is a set of vertices D\subseteq V such that every vertex in V\D has a neighbor in D. An eternal dominating set extends this concept by placing mobile guards on the vertices of D. In response to an infinite sequence of attacks on unoccupied vertices, a guard can move to the attacked vertex from an adjacent position, ensuring that the new guards configuration remains a dominating set. In the one (all) guard(s) move model, only one (multiple) guard(s) moves(may move) per attack. The set of vertices representing the initial configuration of guards in one(all) guard move model is the eternal dominating set (m-eternal dominating set) of G. The minimum size of such a set in one(all) guard move model is called the eternal domination number (m-eternal domination number) of G, respectively. Given a graph G and an integer k, the m-Eternal Dominating Set asks whether G has an m-eternal dominating set of size at most k. In this work, we focus mainly on the computational complexity of m-Eternal Dominating Set in subclasses of chordal graphs. For split graphs, we show a dichotomy result by first designing a polynomial-time algorithm for K1,t-free split graphs with t\le 4, and then proving that the problem becomes NP-complete for t\ge 5. We showed that the problem is NP-hard on undirected path graphs. Moreover, we exhibit the computational complexity difference between the variants by showing the existence of two graph classes such that, in one, both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are solvable in polynomial time while Eternal Dominating Set is NP-hard, whereas in the other, Eternal Dominating Set is solvable in polynomial time and both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are NP-hard. Finally, we present a graph class where Dominating Set is NP-hard, but m-Eternal Dominating Set is efficiently solvable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give new characterizations for the class of uniformly dense matroids and study applications of these characterizations to graphic and real representable matroids. We show that a matroid is uniformly dense if and only if its base polytope contains a point with constant coordinates. As a main application, we derive new spectral, structural and classification results for uniformly dense graphs. In particular, we show that connected regular uniformly dense graphs are $1$-tough and thus contain a (near-)perfect matching. As a second application, we show that strictly uniformly dense real represented matroids can be represented by projection matrices with a constant diagonal and that they are parametrized by a subvariety of the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in the Erd{\"o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm - revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices - finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open - one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ whp. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges, not yet "seen" by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we also prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem, by supporting the conjectured optimality of the greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are inherently unstable, necessitating new ideas. Our proof refines the OGP framework by incorporating several new ideas (including temporal interpolation paths and stopping-times) that we expect to be useful for other online models.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Algorithm for Tropical Linearly Factorized Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tropical semiring is an algebraic system with addition ``$\max$'' and multiplication ``$+$''. As well as in conventional algebra, linear programming in the tropical semiring has been developed. In this study, we introduce a new type of tropical optimization problem, namely, tropical linearly factorized programming. This problem involves minimizing the objective function given by a product of tropical linear forms divided by a tropical monomial, subject to tropical linear inequality constraints. As the objective function is equivalent to the dual of the transportation problem, it is convex in the conventional sense but not in the tropical sense, while the feasible set is convex in the tropical sense but not in the conventional sense.
  Our algorithm for tropical linearly factorized programming is based on the descent method. We first show that a feasible descent direction can be characterized in terms of a specific digraph, called a tangent digraph. Especially in non-degenerate cases, we present a simplex-like algorithm that updates the tree structure of tangent digraphs iteratively. Each iteration can be executed in $O(r_A+r_C)$ time, where $r_A$ and $r_C$ are the numbers of finite coefficients in the constraints and objective function, respectively. For integer instances, our algorithm finds a local optimum in pseudo-polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Designing ReLU Generative Networks to Enumerate Trees with a Given Tree Edit Distance</title>

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 ) and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture, the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35% and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.</description>

      <title>An Approximation Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Cost Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the minimum submodular cost allocation (MSCA) problem. The input of MSCA is $k$ non-negative submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_k$ on the ground set $N$ given by evaluation oracles, and the goal is to partition $N$ into $k$ (possibly empty) sets $S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ so that $\sum_{i=1}^k f_i(S_i)$ is minimized. In this paper, we focus on the case when $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_k$ are monotone, which coincides with the submodular facility location problem considered by Svitkina and Tardos. We show that the integrality gap of a natural LP-relaxation for MSCA with monotone submodular functions is at most $k/2$, yielding a $k/2$-approximation algorithm. We also prove a nearly matching lower bound: the integrality gap is at least $k/2-\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ when $k$ is fixed.</description>
