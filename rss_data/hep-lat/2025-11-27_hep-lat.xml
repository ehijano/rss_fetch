      <title>The phases of QCD reached in terrestrial and cosmic colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the current state of knowledge of the phase diagram of QCD through lattice, effective field theories, and chiral models. Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.</description>

      <title>The Fredenhagen-Marcu operator in the gauge-Higgs Z(2) LGT at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to use the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator as an order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in gauge-matter systems at finite temperature. Concretely, we compute by numerical simulations this operator in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with Z(2) gauge fields coupled to Z(2)-valued Higgs fields. Our conclusion is that the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator can indeed serve as an order parameter capable of distinguishing the deconfinement phase from the Higgs and confinement phases of the theory.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. However, unless the integrated additional term \chi=(g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4xL(x) is not zero, these modified relations are not compatible with gauge invariance. The additional term \chi is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term \chi is largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time (\tau). The bosonic definition of the topological charge Q_t and its Abelian counterpart Q_a written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When \chi is zero, Q_a=3Q_t is expected theoretically, but a simple lattice definition of Q_a is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG, when Q_t is stabilized around -1.</description>

      <title>Triad representation for the anisotropic tensor renormalization group in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm in higher dimensions is an important and urgent task, as the TRG is expected to provide a way to overcome the sign problem in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations at finite density. One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG). However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called the triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy and other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both the ATRG and triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve performance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Correlating lepton flavour violating $b \to s$ and leptonic decay modes in a minimal abelian extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an abelian extension of the Standard Model (SM) comprising a new gauge group $U(1)^\prime$, with the neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ having flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. The fermion content is the same as in SM except for the addition of three right-handed neutrinos. The model, proposed in \cite{Aebischer:2019blw}, describes the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to fermions in terms of three rational parameters $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ that sum to zero imposing the cancellation of the gauge anomalies. Each $\epsilon_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, a feature producing correlations among quark and lepton observables. We focus on $b \to s \ell_1^- \ell_2^+$ transitions for the lepton flavour conserving $\ell_1=\ell_2$ and lepton flavour violating case $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$. Small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found in the first case, which reflects a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors prevent each other to manifest large discrepancies with respect to SM. We investigate the correlations between rare $B$ and $B_s$ decays and the leptonic processes $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$, $\mu^- \to e^- e^+ e^-$ and the $ \mu^- \to e^-$ conversion in nuclei. We show that the current experimental upper bounds on these four channels play an increasingly important role in constraining the branching fractions of lepton flavour violating $B$ and $B_s$ decays. While the present bound on $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$ does not impose significant restrictions, the other three modes set progressively more stringent limits, an important information for the planned new experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>
