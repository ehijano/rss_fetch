      <title>An Efficient Integrator Scheme for Sampling the (Quantum) Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble in (Path Integral) Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because most chemical or biological experiments are performed under conditions of controlled pressure and temperature, it is important to simulate the isobaric-isothermal ensemble at the atomic level to reveal the microscopic mechanism. By extending our configuration sampling protocol for the canonical ensemble, we propose a unified middle scheme to sample the coordinate (configuration) and volume distribution and thereby are able to accurately simulate either classical or quantum isobaric-isothermal processes. Various barostats and thermostats can be employed in the unified middle scheme for simulating real molecular systems with or without holonomic constraints. In particular, we demonstrate the recommended middle scheme by employing the Martyna-Tuckerman-Tobias-Klein barostat and stochastic cell-rescaling barostat, with the Langevin thermostat, in molecular simulation packages (DL_POLY, Amber, Gromacs, etc.). Benchmark numerical tests show that, without additional numerical effort, the middle scheme is competent in increasing the time interval by a factor of 5~10 to achieve the same accuracy of converged results for most thermodynamic properties in (path integral) molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>POD-Based Sparse Stochastic Estimation of Wind Turbine Blade Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a framework for estimating the full vibrational state of wind turbine blades from sparse deflection measurements. The identification is performed in a reduced-order space obtained from a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations based on Geometrically Exact Beam Theory (GEBT). In this space, a Reduced Order Model (ROM) is constructed using a linear stochastic estimator, and further enhanced through Kalman fusion with a quasi-steady model of azimuthal dynamics driven by measured wind speed. The performance of the proposed estimator is assessed in a synthetic environment replicating turbulent inflow and measurement noise over a wide range of operating conditions. Results demonstrate the method's ability to accurately reconstruct three-dimensional deformations and accelerations using noisy displacement and acceleration measurements at only four spatial locations. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed framework for real-time blade monitoring, optimal sensor placement, and active load control in wind turbine systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal multipole center for subwavelength acoustic scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multipole expansion is a powerful framework for analyzing how subwavelength-size objects scatter waves in optics or acoustics. The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial -- it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole-dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.</description>
