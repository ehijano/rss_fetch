      <title>Determination of Some Types of Permutations over $\mathbb{F}_q^2$ with Low-Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of permutations over finite fields is an important topic in number theory with a long-standing history. This paper presents a systematic investigation of low-degree bivariate polynomial systems $F=(f_1(x,y),f_2(x,y))$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}^2$. Specifically, we employ Hermite's Criterion to completely classify bivariate quadratic permutation polynomial systems, while utilizing the theory of permutation rational functions to give a full classification of bivariate 3-homogeneous permutation polynomial systems. Furthermore, as an application of our findings, we provide an explicit characterization of the permutation binomials of the form $x^3+ax^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with characteristic $p\neq3$, thereby resolving a significant special case within this classical research domain.</description>

      <title>A Note on Lower Bounds in Szemer\'edi's Theorem with Random Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider Szemer\'{e}di's theorem on $k$-term arithmetic progressions over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, where the allowed set $S$ of common differences in these progressions is chosen randomly of fixed size. Combining a generalization of an argument of Altman with Moshkovitz--Zhu's bounds for the partition rank of a tensor in terms of its analytic rank, we (slightly) improve the best known lower bounds (due to Bri\"et) on the size $|S|$ required for Szemer\'edi's theorem with difference in $S$ to hold asymptotically almost surely.</description>

      <title>Several expressions for degenerate harmonic numbers and some related numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many authors have recently studied the degenerate harmonic numbers. This paper makes two main contributions. First, we derive several explicit expressions for these numbers, which are a degenerate version of the ordinary harmonic numbers. We also examine the degenerate harmonic numbers of order m and find an expression for them. Second, we investigate some related numbers that are closely connected to the degenerate harmonic numbers of order m, which reduce to the degenerate harmonic numbers when m=1</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the question when a (rational or Gaussian) integral vector can be extended to an integral orthogonal basis consisting of vectors of equal length. We also study when a set of integral vectors has such an extension. Some necessary conditions are given which are proven to be sufficient in dimensions $3$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>Twisted approximation with restricted denominators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an increasing integer sequence $(a_n)$, a real number $\alpha$, and a sequence $\psi(n)$, we study the set $W$ of real numbers $\gamma$ for which $a_n\alpha - \gamma$ is a distance less than $\psi(n)$ away from an integer. This is often referred to as twisted Diophantine approximation, in this case with denominators restricted to the given sequence $(a_n)$. Our main results are about the size of $W$, and they hold for almost every $\alpha$, with respect to a measure of positive Fourier dimension, for example Lebesgue measure. Our results extend recent work of Kristensen and Persson, and answer questions that they posed.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture of Keith on congruences of the reciprocal of a false theta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Keith investigated reciprocals of false theta functions and proved some interesting results such as congruences, asymptotic bounds, and combinatorial identities. At the end of his paper, Keith posed a conjecture on congruences modulo 4 and 8 for the coefficients of the reciprocal of a false theta function. In this paper, we not only confirm Keith's conjecture, but also prove a generalized result.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of spaces and numbers -- anabelian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Can number and geometric spaces be reconstructed from their symmetries?'' This question, which is at the heart of anabelian geometry, a theory built on the collaborative efforts of an international community in many variants and with the Japanese arithmetic school as a core, illustrates, in the case of a positive answer, the universality of the homotopic method in arithmetic geometry. Starting with elementary examples, we first introduce the motivations and guiding principles of the theory, then present its most structuring results and its contemporary trends. As a result, the reader is presented with a rich and diverse landscape of mathematics, which thrives on theoretical and explicit methods, and runs from number theory to topology.</description>

      <title>Khintchine-type theorems for weighted uniform inhomogeneous approximations via transference principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Compositio Math. 155 (2019)] Kleinbock and Wadleigh proved a "zero-one law" for uniform inhomogeneous Diophantine approximations. We generalize this statement with arbitrary weight functions and establish a new and simple proof of this statement, based on transference principle. We also give a complete description of the sets of $g$-Dirichlet pairs with a fixed matrix in this setup from Lebesgue measure point of view. As an application, we consider the set of badly approximable matrices and give a characterization of bad approximability in terms of inhomogeneous approximations. All the aforementioned metrical descriptions work (and sometimes can be strengthened) for weighted Diophantine approximations.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to use a cluster-theoretic approach to give a kind of Diophantine equation whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations.
  We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether the corresponding Laurent polynomial admits a cluster symmetric pair and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra.
  As applications of this framework, we solve two Diophantine equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita in \cite{Gyoda}, and lastly give two Matlab programs, respectively, for constructing invariant Laurent polynomials and finding cluster symmetric pairs.</description>

Abstract: In 2017, E. Panzer proved the parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms. While his proof is simple and constructive, it does not yield a general explicit formula. Inspired by M. Hirose's recent work on the parity theorem for multiple zeta values, this paper presents an explicit formula for the parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>A new zero-density estimate for $\zeta(s)$ and the error term in the Prime Number Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will provide a new type of zero-density estimate for $\zeta(s)$ when $\sigma$ is sufficiently close to $1$. In particular, we will show that $N(\sigma,T)$ can be bounded by an absolute constant when $\sigma$ is sufficiently close to the left edge of the Korobov-Vinogradov zero-free region. As a consequence, we provide the optimal error term in the prime number theorem of the form $$ \psi(x)-x \ll x\exp \left\{-(1-\varepsilon) \omega(x)\right\},\qquad \omega(x):=\min _{t \geq 1}\{\nu(t) \log x+\log t\}, $$ where $\nu(t)=A_0(\log t)^{-2/3}(\log\log t)^{-1/3}$ is a decreasing function such that $\zeta(\sigma+it)\neq 0$ for $\sigma\ge 1-\nu(t)$. Precisely, we will show that we can take $\varepsilon=0$.</description>

      <title>On a multiplicative non-Hecke twist of motivic L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via $\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a number field. For $|\alpha|&lt;1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant RSA Modulus Decomposition via Adaptive R\'enyi Entropy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing RSA's quantum resistance through adaptive R\'enyi entropy optimization in modulus decomposition. We introduce a novel number-theoretic framework that fundamentally alters RSA's vulnerability landscape against Shor's algorithm by strategically constraining prime selection to minimize R\'enyi entropy $\mathscr{H}_2$. Our approach features three fundamental innovations: (1) a quantum-number theoretic security model establishing an exponential relationship between prime distribution asymmetry and quantum attack complexity, (2) an adaptive prime generation algorithm producing $\mathscr{H}_2$-optimized moduli with provable security guarantees, and (3) a security reduction proof demonstrating computational equivalence to lattice-based schemes under quantum random oracle model. Theoretical analysis proves our construction achieves $\Omega(2^{k/3})$ quantum attack complexity for $k$-bit moduli while maintaining classical security assumptions equivalent to standard RSA.
  \textbf{Key Enhancements in Revision:}
  (1) Prime existence proof for critical parameter $\gamma &lt; 2^{-k/6}$ via Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem (Theorem 3.1),
  (2) Explicit lattice embedding construction for Ring-LWE reduction (Theorem 5.3),
  (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic security (Theorem 6.3).</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Gowers Norm Estimation, Polynomial Testing, and Arithmetic Progression Counting over Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity norms $ U^k $ over finite abelian groups and demonstrate their applications to testing polynomial structure and counting arithmetic progressions. Building on recent work for estimating the $ U^2 $-norm over $ \mathbb{F}_2^n $, we generalize the construction to arbitrary finite fields and abelian groups for higher values of $ k $. Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite differences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling efficient detection of structural correlations.
  As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and under appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded function $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such structure. These algorithms leverage recent inverse theorems for Gowers norms, together with amplitude estimation, to reveal higher-order algebraic correlations.
  We also develop a quantum method for estimating the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions $ f : \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \{0,1\} $, based on estimating the $ U^2 $-norm. Though not as query-efficient as Grover-based counting, our approach provides a structure-sensitive alternative aligned with additive combinatorics.
  Finally, we demonstrate that our techniques remain valid under certain quantum noise models, due to the shift-invariance of Gowers norms. This enables noise-resilient implementations within the NISQ regime and suggests that Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms may serve as robust primitives for quantum property testing, learning, and pseudorandomness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional real groups have quaternionic forms of split rank 4 that contain dual pairs $G\times G'$, where $G'$ is the split Lie group of the type $G_2$, and $G$ a Lie group of split rank one. In this paper we restrict the minimal representation of the quaternionic group to the dual pair and prove some significant results for the resulting correspondence of representations.</description>

      <title>Purmutation--invariant Niven numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces permutation-invariant Niven numbers--a novel class of Niven numbers where all digit permutations (with leading zeros automatically ignored) must retain the Niven property. We demonstrate that there exist infinitely many such numbers and that their magnitude is unbounded. Furthermore, we present an exhaustive search method for identifying permutation--invariant Niven numbers.</description>

      <title>Summing over homology groups of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Some Connections Between The Arithmetic and The Geometry of Lipschitz Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5817</link>
      <description>arXiv:1201.5817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some relationships between the arithmetic and the geometry of Lipschitz and Hurwitz integers are presented. In particular, it is shown that the (ternary) vector product of a Lipschitz integer $\alpha$ with two other Lipschitz integers, both orthogonal to $\alpha$, is a left and also a right multiple of $\alpha$, and that the vector product of two left multiples of $\alpha$ with any other Lipschitz integer is still a left multiple of $\alpha$. We also provide new arithmetical proofs for some old results of Gordon Pall, and raise a geometric problem on the location of some integral quaternions that is related to the factorization of some integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15252v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a certain random variable closely related to the value-distribution of the Hurwitz zeta-function with algebraic parameter. We prove a version of the limit theorem, where the limit measure is presented by the law of this random variable. Then we apply it to show that any complex number can be approximated by values of the Hurwitz zeta-function for algebraic irrational parameters but with finite exceptions.</description>

      <title>More on the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties over finite fields with commutative endomorphism algebra: theory and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a categorical description of all abelian varieties with commutative endomorphism ring over a finite field with $q=p^a$ elements in a fixed isogeny class in terms of pairs consisting of a fractional $\mathbb Z[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal and a fractional $W\otimes_{\mathbb Z_p} \mathbb Z_p[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal, with $\pi$ the Frobenius endomorphism and $W$ the ring of integers in an unramified extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ of degree $a$. The latter ideal should be compatible at $p$ with the former and stable under the action of a semilinear Frobenius (and Verschiebung) operator; it will be the Dieudonn\'e module of the corresponding abelian variety. Using this categorical description we create effective algorithms to compute isomorphism classes of these objects and we produce many new examples exhibiting exotic patterns.</description>

      <title>On arithmetic terms expressing the prime-counting function and the n-th prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first fixed-length elementary closed-form expressions for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$, and the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$. These expressions are arithmetic terms, requiring only a finite and fixed number of elementary arithmetic operations from the set: addition, subtraction, multiplication, integer division, and exponentiation. Mazzanti proved that every Kalmar function can be represented as an arithmetic term. We develop an arithmetic term representing the prime omega function, $\omega(n)$, which counts the number of distinct prime divisors of a positive integer $n$. From this term, we find immediately an arithmetic term for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$. Combining these results with a new arithmetic term for binomial coefficients and novel prime-related exponential Diophantine equations, we manage to develop an arithmetic term for the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$, thereby providing a constructive solution to the fundamental question: Is there an order to the primes?</description>

      <title>Cycles and Cuts in Supersingular L-Isogeny Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically. We generalise the notion of $\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts.
  On the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph with cyclic kernels using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts.
  On the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples.
  Furthermore, we describe several directions of active and future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a genus $2$ curve over $\mathbb Q$. We provide a method to systematically search for possible candidates of a prime $\ell\geq 3$ and a genus $1$ curve $X$ for which there exists a genus $3$ curve $Z$ over $\mathbb Q$ whose Jacobian is, up to quadratic twist, $(\ell, \ell, \ell)$-isogenous to the product of Jacobians of $X$ and $Y$, building on the work by Hanselman, Schiavone, and Sijsling for $\ell=2$. We find several such pairs $(X,Y)$ for prime $\ell$ up to $13$. We also improve their numerical gluing algorithm, allowing us to successfully glue genus $1$ and genus $2$ curves along their $13$-torsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a short and entirely elementary proof of the proposition ``For any positive integer $ N $, there exists a real number $ L $ such that for any real number $ x \geqq L $, there are at least $ N $ primes in the interval $ [kx, (k+1)x] $'' for $ k \leqq 15 $. Our proof is based on the idea of the proof by Erd\"{o}s for $ k=1 $ and its improvement by Hitotsumatsu and by Sainose for $ k=2 $. In the case of $ k=3 $ and $ k=4 $, the method is very similar to the case of $ k=2 $, however, in the case of $ k \geqq 5 $, we need new idea to complete the proof.</description>

      <title>Rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ when $N$ is non-squarefree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a non-squarefree integer such that the quotient $X_0(N)^*$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ by the full group of Atkin-Lehner involutions has positive genus. Elkies conjectures that the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ are only cusps or CM points when $N$ is large enough. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$, when they are finite. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A proper Euler's magic matrix is an integer $n\times n$ matrix $M\in\mathbb Z^{n\times n}$ such that $M\cdot M^t=\gamma\cdot I$ for some nonzero constant $\gamma$, the sum of the squares of the entries along each of the two main diagonals equals $\gamma$, and the squares of all entries in $M$ are pairwise distinct. Euler constructed such matrices for $n=4$. In this work, we construct examples for $n=8$ and prove that no such matrix exists for $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of matchable sets and subspaces via Dyson transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A matching from a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ to another subset $B$ is a bijection $f : A \to B$ such that $af(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear perspectives.</description>
