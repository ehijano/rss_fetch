      <title>Temporal and dosimetric beam monitoring of individual pulses in FLASH Radiotherapy using Timepix3 pixelated detector placed out-of-field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FLASH radiotherapy necessitates the development of advanced Quality Assurance methods and detectors for accurate and online monitoring of the radiation field. This study introduces enhanced time-resolution detection systems and methods tailored for single-pulse detection. The goal of this work was to measure the delivered number of pulses, investigate temporal structure of individual pulses, and to develop a method for dose-per-pulse (DPP) monitoring based on secondary radiation particles produced in the experimental room.
  A 20 MeV electron beam generated from a linear accelerator (LINAC) was delivered to a water phantom. Ultra-high dose-per-pulse (UHDPP) electron beams were used with a dose per pulse ranging from 1 Gy to over 7 Gy. The pulse lengths ranged from 1.18 us to 2.88 us at a pulse rate frequency of 5 Hz. A semiconductor pixel detector Timepix3 (TPX3) was used to track direct interactions in the Silicon sensor created by single secondary particles. Measurements were performed in the air, while the detector was positioned out-of-field at a lateral distance of 200 cm parallel with the LINAC exit window. The dose deposited in the silicon was measured along with the pulse length and the nanostructure of the pulse.
  Simultaneously deposited energy and time of arrival of single particles were measured with a precision of 1.56 ns. The measured pulse count agreed with the delivered values. A linear response (R^2 = 0.999) was established between the delivered beam current and the measured dose at the detector position (orders of nGy). The difference between the average measured and average delivered pulse length was 0.003(30) us.
  This simple non-invasive method, exhibits no limitations on the delivered DPP within the range used during this investigation. It enhances the precision and real-time monitoring of FLASH treatment plans with nanosecond precision.</description>

      <title>Focal Volume, Acoustic Radiation Force, and Strain in Two-Transducer Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) holds promise for non-invasive neural modulation in treating neurological disorders. Most clinically relevant targets are deep within the brain, surrounded by other sensitive regions that need to be spared clinical intervention. However, in TUS, increasing frequency with the goal of improving spatial resolution reduces the effective penetration depth. We show that by using a pair of 1 MHz, orthogonally arranged transducers we improve the spatial resolution afforded by each of the transducers individually, by nearly $40$ fold, achieving a sub-cubic millimeter target volume of $0.24\ mm^3$ deep within the brain. We show that orthogonally placed transducers generate highly localized standing waves with Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF) arranged into periodic regions of compression and tension near the target. We further present an extended capability of the orthogonal setup, which is to impart selective pressures--either positive or negative, but not both--on the target. Lastly, we share our preliminary findings that strain can arise from both particle motion and ARF with the former reaching its maximum value at the focus, and the latter remaining null at the focus and reaching its maximum around the focus.
  As the field is investigating the mechanism of interaction in TUS by way of elucidating the mapping between ultrasound parameters and neural response, orthogonal transducers expand our toolbox by making it possible to conduct these investigations at much finer spatial resolutions, with localized and directed (compression vs. tension) ARF and the capability of applying selective pressures at the target.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Ultrasound Beamforming with End-to-End Deep Learning for Single Plane Wave Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast ultrasound imaging insonifies a medium with one or a combination of a few plane waves at different beam-steered angles instead of many focused waves. It can achieve much higher frame rates, but often at the cost of reduced image quality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate this disadvantage, in particular for single plane wave imaging. Predominantly, image-to-image post-processing networks or fully learned data-to-image neural networks are used. Both construct their mapping purely data-driven and require expressive networks and large amounts of training data to perform well. In contrast, we consider data-to-image networks which incorporate a conventional image formation techniques as differentiable layers in the network architecture. This allows for end-to-end training with small amounts of training data. In this work, using f-k migration as an image formation layer is evaluated in-depth with experimental data. We acquired a data collection designed for benchmarking data-driven plane wave imaging approaches using a realistic breast mimicking phantom and an ultrasound calibration phantom. The evaluation considers global and local image similarity measures and contrast, resolution and lesion detectability analysis. The results show that the proposed network architecture is capable of improving the image quality of single plane wave images on all evaluation metrics. Furthermore, these image quality improvements can be achieved with surprisingly little amounts of training data.</description>

      <title>Quasistatic approximation in neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00486v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and explain the quasistatic approximation (QSA) as applied to field modeling for electrical and magnetic stimulation. Neuromodulation analysis pipelines include discrete stages, and QSA is applied specifically when calculating the electric and magnetic fields generated in tissues by a given stimulation dose. QSA simplifies the modeling equations to support tractable analysis, enhanced understanding, and computational efficiency. The application of QSA in neuro-modulation is based on four underlying assumptions: (A1) no wave propagation or self-induction in tissue, (A2) linear tissue properties, (A3) purely resistive tissue, and (A4) non-dispersive tissue. As a consequence of these assumptions, each tissue is assigned a fixed conductivity, and the simplified equations (e.g., Laplace's equation) are solved for the spatial distribution of the field, which is separated from the field's temporal waveform. Recognizing that electrical tissue properties may be more complex, we explain how QSA can be embedded in parallel or iterative pipelines to model frequency dependence or nonlinearity of conductivity. We survey the history and validity of QSA across specific applications, such as microstimulation, deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise definition and explanation of QSA in neuromodulation are essential for rigor when using QSA models or testing their limits.</description>
