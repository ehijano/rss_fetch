      <title>Intermittency in Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections Observed by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittency has been studied extensively in the fast and slow solar winds but to a far lesser extent in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). While ICMEs are often characterized by their relatively smooth, large-scale magnetic flux rope structures, a spectrum of fluctuations is nonetheless present at smaller scales. We have examined kurtosis and its scaling exponents at magnetohydrodynamic inertial scales in 49 ICMEs observed between 0.25 and 1 au by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, and compared the results to those obtained for the ICME sheath regions and ambient solar wind intervals. Kurtosis behaves similarly in all intervals studied and presents a universal behavior typical of intermittent time series. The ICMEs displayed a radially invariant level of intermittency, suggesting that they are relatively static, well-developed turbulent environments. In the sheath regions, the level of intermittency increased with distance, indicating that the turbulence is not yet fully developed at small heliocentric distances. In addition to intermittent fluctuations related to turbulence, the sheath regions may possess a population of non-turbulent structures that increase the absolute value of kurtosis.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Modeling of the Solar Wind Flow with Boundary Conditions Governed by Synchronic Photospheric Magnetograms. I. Multi-point Validation in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind (SW) is a vital component of space weather, providing a background for solar transients such as coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions, and energetic particles propagating toward Earth. Accurate prediction of space weather events requires a precise description and thorough understanding of physical processes occurring in the ambient SW plasma. Ensemble simulations of the three-dimensional SW flow are performed using an empirically-driven magnetohydrodynamic heliosphere model implemented in the Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS). The effect of uncertainties in the photospheric boundary conditions on the simulation outcome is investigated. The results are in good overall agreement with the observations from the Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and OMNI data at Earth, specifically during 2020-2021. This makes it possible to shed more light on the properties of the SW propagating through the heliosphere and perspectives for improving space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Complete Catalog of Laser Locking Configurations for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will enable direct observations of low-frequency gravitational waves, offering unprecedented insight into astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. LISA's heterodyne interferometric measurement system requires phase-locking five of its six onboard lasers with tunable frequency offsets to ensure that all beatnotes remain within the metrology system's operational range, despite Doppler-induced frequency shifts. The selection of these offset frequencies -- collectively forming a frequency plan -- is a complex optimization problem constrained by the spacecraft's orbital dynamics and instrument limitations. While previous work established an algorithmic solution for deriving time-dependent frequency plans, this study takes a complementary approach by systematically analyzing and cataloging all possible laser locking configurations. We present an automated method to explore, validate, and classify viable locking schemes, identifying 36 unique non-frequency-swapping configurations and 72 additional frequency-swapping configurations for an arbitrary choice of primary laser. This exhaustive classification provides a foundation for frequency planning across the full range of operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations of Supra-Arcade Downflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their somewhat-frequent appearance in EUV imaging of off-limb flares, the origins of Supra-Arcade Downflows (SADs) remain a mystery. Appearing as dark, tendril-like downflows above growing flare loop arcades, SADs themselves are yet to be tied into the standard model of solar flares. The uncertainty of their origin is, in part, due to a lack of spectral observations, with the last published SAD spectral observations dating back to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory / Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SOHO/SUMER) era in 2003. In this work, we present new observations of SADs within an M-class solar flare on April 2nd, 2022, observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure Fe XXIV 192.02 Angstrom Doppler downflows and non-thermal velocities in the low-intensity SAD features, exceeding values measured in the surrounding flare fan. The ratio of temperature-sensitive Fe XXIV 255.11 Angstrom and Fe XXIII 263.41 Angstrom lines also allow the measurement of electron temperature, revealing temperatures within the range of the surrounding flare fan. We compare EIS line-of-sight Doppler velocities with plane-of-sky velocities measured by AIA, to construct the 3D velocity profile of four prominent SADs, finding evidence for their divergence above the flare loop arcade - possibly related to the presence of a high altitude termination shock. Finally, we detect 'stealth' SADs, which produce SAD-like Doppler signals, yet with no change in intensity.</description>

      <title>Hyper Boris integrators for kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of numerical solvers for the nonrelativistic Newton--Lorentz equation in kinetic plasma simulations. The new solvers extend the standard 4-step Boris procedure, which has second-order accuracy in time, in three ways. First, we repeat the 4-step procedure multiple times, using an $n$-times smaller timestep ($\Delta t/n$). We derive a formula for the arbitrary subcycling number $n$, so that we obtain the result without repeating the same calculations. Second, prior to the 4-step procedure, we apply Boris-type gyrophase corrections to the electromagnetic field. In addition to a well-known correction to the magnetic field, we correct the electric field in an anisotropic manner to achieve higher-order ($N=2,4,6 \dots$th order) accuracy. Third, combining these two methods, we propose a family of high-accuracy particle solvers, the hyper Boris solvers, which have two hyperparameters of the subcycling number $n$ and the order of accuracy, $N$. The $n$-cycle $N$th-order solver gives a numerical error of $\sim (\Delta t/n)^{N}$ at affordable computational cost.</description>
