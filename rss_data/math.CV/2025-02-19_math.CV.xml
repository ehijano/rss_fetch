      <title>A characterization of Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds in locally conformally K\"{a}hler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a certain class of solvable Lie groups, if they admit a left-invariant non-Vaisman locally conformally K\"{a}hler metric and a lattice, they must arise from the construction of Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds. This result provides a natural explanation for why number-theoretic considerations play a role in the construction of Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds.</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of symmetric Kubo-Ando operator means satisfying Moln\'ar's weak associativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of a subclass of weakly associative means of positive operators in the class of symmetric Kubo-Ando means. This class, which includes the geometric mean, was first introduced and studied in L. Moln\'ar, ``Characterizations of certain means of positive operators," Linear Algebra Appl. 567 (2019) 143-166, where he gives a characterization of this subclass (which we call the Moln\'ar class of means) in terms of the properties of their representing operator monotone functions. Moln\'ar's paper leaves open the problem of determining if the geometric mean is the only such mean in that subclass. Here we give a negative answer to this question by constructing an order-preserving bijection between this class and a class of real measurable odd periodic functions bounded in absolute value by $1/2$. Each member of the latter class defines a Molnar mean by an explicit exponential-integral representation. From this we are able to understand the order structure of the Moln\'ar class and construct several infinite families of explicit examples of Moln\'ar means that are not the geometric mean. Our analysis also shows how to modify Moln\'ar's original characterization so that the geometric mean is the only one satisfying the requisite set of properties.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates: from Yau to Kolodziej</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we provide a new and efficient approach to uniform estimates for solutions to complex Monge-Ampere equations, as well as for solutions to geometric PDE's that satisfy a determinantal majorization.</description>
