      <title>Contact surgery numbers of Sigma(2,3,11) and L(4m+3,4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all contact structures with contact surgery number one on the Brieskorn sphere Sigma(2,3,11) with both orientations. We conclude that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on each of the above manifolds which cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere. We further prove similar results for some lens spaces: We classify all contact structures with contact surgery number one on lens spaces of the form L(4m+3,4). Along the way, we present an algorithm and a formula for computing the Euler class of a contact structure from a general rational contact surgery description and classify which rational surgeries along Legendrian unknots are tight and which ones are overtwisted.</description>

      <title>Strong generalized holomorphic principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a strong generalized holomorphic (SGH) fiber bundle and develop connection and curvature theory for an SGH principal $G$-bundle over a regular generalized complex (GC) manifold, where $G$ is a complex Lie group. We develop a de Rham cohomology for regular GC manifolds, and a Dolbeault cohomology for SGH vector bundles. Moreover, we establish a Chern-Weil theory for SGH principal $G$-bundles under certain mild assumptions on the leaf space of the GC structure. We also present a Hodge theory along with associated dualities and vanishing theorems for SGH vector bundles. Several examples of SGH fiber bundles are given.</description>

      <title>Orientations of Morse flow trees in Legendrian contact homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:1601.07346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a closed, connected, spin Legendrian submanifold of the 1-jet space of a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold. We give a coherent orientation scheme for the moduli space of rigid Morse flow trees of $\Lambda$, implying that the Legendrian contact homology of $\Lambda$ with integer coefficients can be computed using Morse flow trees. If $n&gt;1$ then this orientation scheme can be computed with an algorithm which uses intersections of oriented flow manifolds in $M$ together with combinatorial data coming from the trees.</description>

      <title>On knot types of clean Lagrangian intersections in $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09912v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K_0$ and $K$ be knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Suppose that by a compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopy on $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$, the conormal bundle of $K_0$ is isotopic to a Lagrangian submanifold which intersects the zero section cleanly along $K$. In this paper, we prove some constraints on the pair of knot types of $K_0$ and $K$. One example is that if $K_0$ is the unknot, then $K$ is also the unknot. We also consider some cases where $K_0$ and $K$ have specific knot types, such as torus knots and connected sums of trefoil knots. The key step is finding a DGA map between the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGAs of the unit conormal bundles of knots. The main results are deduced from a relation between the augmentation varieties of $K_0$ and $K$ determined by these DGAs.</description>

      <title>A Kodaira type conjecture on almost complex 4 manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14690v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Not long ago, Cirici and Wilson defined a Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds to answer Hirzebruch's problem. In this paper, we define a refined Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds. We show that the condition $\tilde h^{1,0}=\tilde h^{0,1}$ implies a symplectic structure on a compact almost complex $4$ manifold, where $\tilde h^{1,0}$ and $\tilde h^{0,1}$ are the dimensions of the refined Dolbeault cohomology groups with bi-degrees $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ respectively. Combining the partial answer to Donaldson's tameness conjecture, we offer a sufficient condition for a compact almost complex $4$ manifold to become an almost K\"ahler one.
  Moreover, we prove that the condition $\tilde{h}^{1,0}=\tilde h^{0,1}$ is equivalent to the generalized $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. This can be regarded as an analogue of the Kodaira's conjecture on almost complex $4$ manifolds. As an application, we show that the Kodaira-Thurston manifold satisfies the $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. Meanwhile, we show that the Fr\"olicher-type equality does not hold on a general almost complex $4$ manifold, which is different to the case of compact complex surfaces.</description>
