      <title>Stabbing non-piercing sets and face lengths in large girth plane graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a non-piercing family of connected planar sets with bounded independence number can be stabbed with a constant number of points. As a consequence, we answer a question of Axenovich, Kie{\ss}le and Sagdeev about the largest possible face length of an edge-maximal plane graph with girth at least $g$.</description>

      <title>Re-imagining Spectral Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Laplacian based on general inner product spaces, which we call the inner product Laplacian. We show the combinatorial and normalized graph Laplacians, as well as other Laplacians for hypergraphs and directed graphs, are special cases of the inner product Laplacian. After developing the necessary basic theory for the inner product Laplacian, we establish generalized analogs of key isoperimetric inequalities, including the Cheeger inequality and expander mixing lemma. Dirichlet and Neumann subgraph eigenvalues may also be recovered as appropriate limit points of a sequence of inner product Laplacians. In addition to suggesting a new context through which to examine existing Laplacians, this generalized framework is also flexible in applications: through choice of an inner product on the vertices and edges of a graph, the inner product Laplacian naturally encodes both combinatorial structure and domain-knowledge.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic configurations on a circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we two-colour a circle, we can always find an inscribed triangle with angles $(\frac{\pi}{7},\frac{2\pi}{7},\frac{4\pi}{7})$ whose three vertices have the same colour. In fact, Bialostocki and Nielsen showed that it is enough to consider the colours on the vertices of an inscribed heptagon. We prove that for every other triangle $T$ there is a two-colouring of the circle without any monochromatic copy of $T$.
  More generally, for $k\geq 3$, call a $k$-tuple $(d_1,d_2,\dots,d_k)$ with $d_1\geq d_2\geq \dots \geq d_k&gt;0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^k d_i=1$ a Ramsey $k$-tuple if the following is true: in every two-colouring of the circle of unit perimeter, there is a monochromatic $k$-tuple of points in which the distances of cyclically consecutive points, measured along the arcs, are $d_1,d_2,\dots,d_k$ in some order. By a conjecture of Stromquist, if $d_i=\frac{2^{k-i}}{2^k-1}$, then $(d_1,\dots,d_k)$ is Ramsey.
  Our main result is a proof of the converse of this conjecture. That is, we show that if $(d_1,\dots,d_k)$ is Ramsey, then $d_i=\frac{2^{k-i}}{2^k-1}$. We do this by finding connections of the problem to certain questions from number theory about partitioning $\mathbb{N}$ into so-called Beatty sequences. We also disprove a majority version of Stromquist's conjecture, study a robust version, and discuss a discrete version.</description>

      <title>Proposal of a generating function of partition sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the generating functions of partition sequences. Partition sequences have a one-to-one correspondence with partitions. Therefore, the generating function has no multiplicity and appears meaningless initially. However, we show that using a matrix can give meaning to the coefficients and preserve valuable information about partitions. We also introduce some restrictions on partitions suitable for these generating functions.</description>

      <title>Obtuse almost-equiangular sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $t \in [-1, 1)$, a set of points on the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere is called $t$-almost equiangular if among any three distinct points there is a pair with inner product $t$. We propose a semidefinite programming upper bound for the maximum cardinality $\alpha(n, t)$ of such a set based on an extension of the Lov\'asz theta number to hypergraphs. This bound is at least as good as previously known bounds and for many values of $n$ and $t$ it is better.
  We also refine existing spectral methods to show that $\alpha(n, t) \leq 2(n+1)$ for all $n$ and $t \leq 0$, with equality only at $t = -1/n$. This allows us to show the uniqueness of the optimal construction at $t = -1/n$ for $n \leq 5$ and to enumerate all possible constructions for $n \leq 3$ and $t \leq 0$.</description>

      <title>Projected Gradient Descent Method for Tropical Principal Component Analysis over Tree Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Yoshida et al. developed tropical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that is, an analogue of the classical PCA in the setting of tropical geometry and applied it to visualize a set of gene trees over a space of phylogenetic trees which is an union of lower dimensional polyhedral cones in an Euclidean space with its dimension $m(m-1)/2$ where $m$ is the number of leaves. In this paper, we introduce a projected gradient descent method to estimate the tropical principal polytope over the space of phylogenetic trees and we apply it to apicomplexa dataset. With computational experiment against MCMC samplers, we show that our projected gradient descent works very well.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Turn Tours of Even Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a connected bounded region in the plane formed out of $2 \times 2$ blocks joined by their sides. Peng and Rascoussier conjectured that all minimum-turn Hamiltonian cycles of $P$ exhibit a certain regular structure. We prove this conjecture in the special case when $P$ is a topological disk. The proof proceeds in two phases - a "downward" phase where we break apart an irregular Hamiltonian cycle into a collection of shorter cycles; and an "upward" phase where we put it back together in a different way so that, overall, the number of turns in it decreases.</description>

      <title>The Higman-M\lowercase{c}Laughlin Theorem for the flag-transitive $2$-designs with $\lambda$ prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous result of Higman and McLaughlin \cite{HM} in 1961 asserts that any flag-transitive automorphism group $G$ of a $2$-design $\mathcal{D}$ with $\lambda=1$ acts point-primitively on $\mathcal{D}$. In this paper, we show that the Higman and McLaughlin theorem is still true when $\lambda$ is a prime and $\mathcal{D}$ is not isomorphic to one of the two $2$-$(16,6,2)$ designs as in [42, Section 1.2], or the $2$-$(45,12,3)$ design as in [44, Construction 4.2], or, when $2^{2^{j}}+1$ is a Fermat prime, a possible $2$-$(2^{2^{j+1}}(2^{2^{j}}+2),2^{2^{j}}(2^{2^{j}}+1),2^{2^{j}}+1)$ design having very specific features.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the exact asymptotic behavior of the connectivity probability in a random binomial bipartite graph $G(n,m,p)$ under various regimes of the edge probability $p=p(n)$. To determine this probability, a method based on the analysis of inhomogeneous random walks is proposed.</description>

      <title>Avoshifts, Unishifts and Nondeterministic Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study avoshifts and unishifts on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Avoshifts are subshifts where for each convex set $C$, and each vector $v$ such that $C \cup \{\vec v\}$ is also convex, the set of valid extensions of globally valid patterns on $C$ to ones on $C \cup \{v\}$ is determined by a bounded subpattern of $C$. Unishifts are the subshifts where for such $C, \vec v$, every $C$-pattern has the same number of $\vec v$-extensions. Cellwise quasigroup shifts (including group shifts) and TEP subshifts are examples of unishifts, while unishifts and subshifts with topological strong spatial mixing are examples of avoshifts. We prove that every avoshift is the spacetime subshift of a nondeterministic cellular automaton on an avoshift of lower dimension up to a linear transformation and a convex blocking. From this, we deduce that all avoshifts contain periodic points, and that unishifts have dense periodic points and admit equal entropy full shift factors.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in an Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open, one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ w.h.p. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges not yet 'seen' by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for all $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$, where $d$ is a large constant. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we further prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem by supporting the conjectured optimality of the aforementioned greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of tuples of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) commonly used as a barrier for classes of algorithms. While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are not stable and our application of OGP-based techniques to online setting is novel.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Structure of Universal Partial Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal partial cycle (or upcycle) for $\mathcal{A}^n$ is a cyclic sequence that covers each word of length $n$ over the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ exactly once -- like a De Bruijn cycle, except that we also allow a wildcard symbol $\mathord{\diamond}$ that can represent any letter of $\mathcal{A}$. Chen et al. in 2017 and Goeckner et al. in 2018 showed that the existence and structure of upcycles are highly constrained, unlike those of De Bruijn cycles, which exist for every alphabet size and word length. Moreover, it was not known whether any upcycles existed for $n \ge 5$. We present several examples of upcycles over both binary and non-binary alphabets for $n = 8$. We generalize two graph-theoretic representations of De Bruijn cycles to upcycles. We then introduce novel approaches to constructing new upcycles from old ones. Notably, given any upcycle for an alphabet of size $a$, we show how to construct an upcycle for an alphabet of size $ak$ for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$, so each example generates an infinite family of upcycles. We also define folds and lifts of upcycles, which relate upcycles with differing densities of $\mathord{\diamond}$ characters. In particular, we show that every upcycle lifts to a De Bruijn cycle. Our constructions rely on a different generalization of De Bruijn cycles known as perfect necklaces, and we introduce several new examples of perfect necklaces. We extend the definitions of certain pseudorandomness properties to partial words and determine which are satisfied by all upcycles, then draw a conclusion about linear feedback shift registers. Finally, we prove new nonexistence results based on the word length $n$, alphabet size, and $\mathord{\diamond}$ density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattices are simplified by removing some of their doubly irreducible elements, resulting in smaller lattices called racks. All vertically indecomposable modular racks of $n \le 40$ elements are listed, and the numbers of all modular lattices of $n \le 40$ elements are obtained by P\'olya counting. SageMath code is provided that allows easy access both to the listed racks, and to the modular lattices that were not listed. More than 3000-fold savings in storage space are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the saturation number and a strengthening for triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11387v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The saturation number $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ of a graph $H$ and positive integer $n$ is the minimum size of a graph of order $n$ which does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $H$ but to which the addition of any edge creates such a subgraph. Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Moon first studied saturation numbers of complete graphs, and Cameron and Puleo introduced a general lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n,H)$. In this paper, we present another lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ with strengthenings for graphs $H$ in several classes, all of which include the class of triangle-free graphs. Demonstrating its effectiveness, we determine the saturation numbers of diameter-$3$ trees up to an additive constant; these are double stars $S_{s,t}$ of order $s + t$ whose central vertices have degrees $s$ and $t$. Faudree, Faudree, Gould, and Jacobson determined that $\operatorname{sat}(n, S_{t,t}) = (t-1)n/2 + O(1)$. We prove that $\operatorname{sat}(n,S_{s,t}) = (st+s)n/(2t+4) + O(1)$ when $s &lt; t$. We also apply our lower bound to caterpillars and demonstrate an upper bound on the saturation numbers of certain diameter-$4$ caterpillars.</description>

      <title>Sum of squares of hook lengths and contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that for the Young diagram of any partition of an integer $n$, the sum of squares of the hook lengths of its cells is exactly $n^2$ more than that of the contents of its cells. That is, for any partition $\lambda$ of an integer $n$, \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{u \in \lambda} h(u)^2 = n^2 + \sum_{u \in \lambda} c(u)^2. \end{equation*} We provide a bijective proof of this fact, thus solving a problem posed by Stanley. Along the way, we obtain a formula for the number of rectangles in the Young diagram of a partition. We also mention a result for sums of other powers of hook lengths and contents.</description>

      <title>Generation of Cycle Permutation Graphs and Permutation Snarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the efficient generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic cycle permutation graphs, i.e. cubic graphs with a $2$-factor consisting of two chordless cycles, non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs and permutation snarks, i.e. cycle permutation graphs that do not admit a $3$-edge-colouring. This allows us to generate all cycle permutation graphs up to order $34$ and all permutation snarks up to order $46$, improving upon previous computational results by Brinkmann et al. Moreover, we give several improved lower bounds for interesting permutation snarks, such as for a smallest permutation snark of order $6 \bmod 8$ or a smallest permutation snark of girth at least $6$. These computational results also allow us to complete a characterisation of the orders for which non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs exist, answering an open question by Klee from 1972, and yield many more counterexamples to a conjecture by Zhang.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Patterns in Ramsey Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate homogeneous versions of certain nonlinear Ramsey-theoretic results, with three significant applications.
  As the first application, we prove that for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{Z}^+$, there exist an infinite set $A$ and an arbitrarily large finite set $B$ such that $A \cup (A+B) \cup A \cdot B$ is monochromatic. This result resolves the finitary version of a question posed by Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson regarding the partition regularity of $(A+B) \cup A \cdot B$ for infinite sets $A, B$ (see (Question 8.4, J. Amer. Math. Soc., 37 (2024))), which is closely related to a question of Erd\H{o}s.
  As the second application, we make progress on a nonlinear extension of the partition regularity of Pythagorean triples. Specifically, we demonstrate that the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2 + P(u_1, \dots, u_n)$ is $2$-regular for certain appropriately chosen polynomials $P$ of any desired degree.
  Finally, as the third application, we establish a nonlinear variant of Rado's conjecture concerning the degree of regularity. We prove that for every $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, there exists an $m$-degree homogeneous equation that is $n$-regular but not $(n+1)$-regular. The case $m = 1$ corresponds to Rado's conjecture, originally proven by Alexeev and Tsimerman (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 117 (2010), and later independently by Golowich (Electron. J. Combin. 21 (2014)).</description>

      <title>Asymmetric results about graph homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important results in extremal graph theory can be roughly summarised as "if a triangle-free graph $G$ has certain properties, then it has a homomorphism to a triangle-free graph $\Gamma$ of bounded size". For example, bounds on homomorphism thresholds give such a statement if $G$ has sufficiently high minimum degree, and the approximate homomorphism theorem gives such a statement for all $G$, if one weakens the notion of homomorphism appropriately.
  In this paper, we study asymmetric versions of these results, where the assumptions on $G$ and $\Gamma$ need not match. For example, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with odd girth at least $9$ and minimum degree at least $\delta |G|$, then $G$ is homomorphic to a triangle-free graph whose size depends only on $\delta$. Moreover, the odd girth assumption can be weakened to odd girth at least $7$ if $G$ has bounded VC dimension or bounded domination number. This gives a new and improved proof of a result of Huang et al.
  We also prove that in the asymmetric approximate homomorphism theorem, the bounds exhibit a rather surprising ``double phase transition'': the bounds are super-exponential if $G$ is only assumed to be triangle-free, they become exponential if $G$ is assumed to have odd girth $7$ or $9$, and become linear if $G$ has odd girth at least $11$.
  Our proofs use a wide variety of techniques, including entropy arguments, the Frieze--Kannan weak regularity lemma, properties of the generalised Mycielskian construction, and recent work on abundance and the asymmetric removal lemma.</description>

      <title>Zigzags, contingency tables, and quotient rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{x}_{k \times p}$ be a $k \times p$ matrix of variables and let $\mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{k \times p}]$ be the polynomial ring in these variables. Given two weak compositions $\alpha,\beta \models_0 n$ of lengths $\ell(\alpha) = k$ and $\ell(\beta) = p$, we study the ideal $I_{\alpha,\beta} \subseteq \mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{k \times \ell}]$ generated by row sums, column sums, monomials in row $i$ of degree $&gt; \alpha_i$, and monomials in column $j$ of degree $&gt; \beta_j$. We prove results connecting algebraic properties of the quotient ring $R_{\alpha,\beta} := \mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{k \times \ell}]/I_{\alpha,\beta}$ with the set $C_{\alpha,\beta}$ of $\alpha,\beta$-contingency tables. The standard monomial basis of $R_{\alpha,\beta}$ with respect to a diagonal term order is encoded by the matrix-ball avatar of the RSK correspondence. We describe the Hilbert series of $R_{\alpha,\beta}$ in terms of a zigzag statistic on contingency tables. The ring $R_{\alpha,\beta}$ carries a graded action of the product $\mathrm{Stab}(\alpha) \times \mathrm{Stab}(\beta)$ of symmetry groups of the sequences $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k)$ and $\beta = (\beta_1,\dots,\beta_p)$; we describe how to calculate the isomorphism type of this graded action. Our analysis regards the set $C_{\alpha,\beta}$ as a locus in the affine space $\mathrm{Mat}_{k \times p}(\mathbb{F})$ and applies orbit harmonics to this locus.</description>

Abstract: We define a generalization of threshold graphs which we call $k$-rainbow threshold graphs. We show that the collection of $k$-rainbow threshold graphs do not satisfy the $0$-$1$ law for first order logic and that asymptotically almost surely all $(k+1)$-rainbow threshold graphs are not isomorphic to a $k$-rainbow threshold graph.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we defined neo balcobalancing numbers, neo Lucas-balcobalancing numbers, neo balcobalancers and neo Lucas-balcobalancers and derived the general terms of these numbers in terms of balancing numbers. Conversely we deduced the general terms of balancing, cobalancing, Lucas-balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers in terms of these numbers. We also deduced some relations on Binet formulas, recurrence relations, relationship with Pell, Pell-Lucas, triangular, square triangular numbers, Pythagorean triples and Cassini identities. We also formulate the sum of first $n$-terms of these numbers and obtained some formulas for the sums of Pell, Pell-Lucas, balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers in terms of these numbers.</description>

Abstract: This in an introduction to free probability theory, covering the basic combinatorial and analytic theory, as well as the relations to random matrices and operator algebras. The material is mainly based on the two books of the lecturer, one joint with Nica and one joint with Mingo. Free probability is here restricted to the scalar-valued setting, the operator-valued version is treated in the subsequent lecture series on "Non-Commutative Distributions". The material here was presented in the winter term 2018/19 at Saarland University in 26 lectures of 90 minutes each. The lectures were recorded and can be found online at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY11JnnnTUCYZni2Q7QNVa9hPGu77GK4M</description>

      <title>Visualizing Geophylogenies -- Internal and External Labeling with Phylogenetic Tree Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geophylogeny is a phylogenetic tree (or dendrogram) where each leaf (e.g. biological taxon) has an associated geographic location (site). To clearly visualize a geophylogeny, the tree is typically represented as a crossing-free drawing next to a map. The correspondence between the taxa and the sites is either shown with matching labels on the map (internal labeling) or with leaders that connect each site to the corresponding leaf of the tree (external labeling). In both cases, a good order of the leaves is paramount for understanding the association between sites and taxa. We define several quality measures for internal labeling and give an efficient algorithm for optimizing them. In contrast, minimizing the number of leader crossings in an external labeling is NP-hard. On the positive side, we show that crossing-free instances can be solved in polynomial time and give a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm. Furthermore, optimal solutions can be found in a matter of seconds on realistic instances using integer linear programming. Finally, we provide several efficient heuristic algorithms and experimentally show them to be near optimal on real-world and synthetic instances.</description>

      <title>Proofs of Mizuno's Conjectures on Rank Three Nahm Sums of Index $(1,2,2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mizuno provided 15 examples of generalized rank three Nahm sums with symmetrizer $\mathrm{diag}(1,2,2)$ which are conjecturally modular. Using the theory of Bailey pairs and some $q$-series techniques, we establish a number of triple sum Rogers--Ramanujan type identities. These identities confirm the modularity of all of Mizuno's examples except that two Nahm sums are sums of modular forms of weights $0$ and $1$. We also prove Mizuno's conjectural modular transformation formulas for two vector-valued functions consisting of Nahm sums with symmetrizers $\mathrm{diag}(1,1,2)$ and $\mathrm{diag}(1,2,2)$.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity in Quadratically Regularized Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is a sparse alternative to entropic regularization: the solution measure tends to have small support. Computational experience suggests that the support decreases monotonically to the unregularized counterpart as the regularization parameter is relaxed. We find it useful to investigate this monotonicity more abstractly for linear programs over polytopes, regularized with the squared norm. Here, monotonicity can be stated as an invariance property of the curve mapping the regularization parameter to the solution: once the curve enters a face of the polytope, does it remain in that face forever? We show that this invariance is equivalent to a geometric property of the polytope, namely that each face contains the minimum norm point of its affine hull. Returning to the optimal transport problem and its associated Birkhoff polytope, we verify this property for low dimensions, but show that it fails for marginals with five or more point masses. As a consequence, the conjectured monotonicity of the support fails in general, even if experiments suggest that monotonicity holds for many cost matrices. Separately, we apply our geometric point of view to a problem of Erd\H{o}s, namely to characterize the doubly stochastic matrices whose maximal trace equals their squared norm.</description>

      <title>Dynamically syndetic sets and the combinatorics of syndetic, idempotent filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset of the positive integers is dynamically central syndetic if it contains the set of times that a point returns to a neighborhood of itself under a minimal transformation of a compact metric space. These sets are part of the highly-influential link between dynamics and combinatorics forged by Furstenberg and Weiss in the 1970's. Our main result is a characterization of dynamically central syndetic sets as precisely those sets that belong to syndetic, idempotent filters. Idempotent filters are combinatorial objects that abound in ergodic Ramsey theory but have been largely unnoticed and unexplored. We develop the algebra of these objects for the proof of the main theorem and with an eye toward future applications.
  The main result is best contextualized as a "global" analogue to the "local" characterization of Furstenberg's central sets as members of minimal, idempotent ultrafilters. It leads to a dual characterization of sets of topological pointwise recurrence, allowing us to answer a question of Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. We draw numerous striking contrasts between pointwise recurrence and set recurrence, a topic with a long history in the subject and its applications, and answer four questions posed by Host, Kra, and Maass. We also show that the intersection of a dynamically central syndetic set with a set of pointwise recurrence must be piecewise syndetic, generalizing results of Dong, Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positive spanning sets (PSSs) are families of vectors that span a given linear space through non-negative linear combinations. Despite certain classes of PSSs being well understood, a complete characterization of PSSs remains elusive. In this paper, we explore a relatively understudied relationship between positive spanning sets and strongly edge-connected digraphs, in that the former can be viewed as a generalization of the latter. We leverage this connection to define a decomposition structure for positive spanning sets inspired by the ear decomposition from digraph theory.</description>

      <title>The $k$-elongated plane partition function modulo small powers of $5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andrews and Paule revisited combinatorial structures known as the $k$-elongated partition diamonds, which were introduced in connection with the study of the broken $k$-diamond partitions. They found the generating function for the number $d_k(n)$ of partitions obtained by summing the links of such partition diamonds of length $n$ and discovered congruences for $d_k(n)$ using modular forms. Since then, congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors, most recently Banerjee and Smoot who established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of $5$. We extend in this paper the list of known results for $d_k(n)$ by proving infinite families of congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo $5,25$, and $125$ using classical $q$-series manipulations and $5$-dissections.</description>
