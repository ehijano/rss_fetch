      <title>Simple random walks on higher dimensional tori are mixing and not uniquely ergodic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that in one dimension the environment viewed by the particle process (EVP process) in quasi periodic random environment is uniquely ergodic and mixing under mild additional assumptions. Here we construct an analytic quasi periodic environment on higher dimensional torus such that the EVP process is not uniquely ergodic. The stationary measures in this counterexample are necessarily atomless. We show also that the EVP process is mixing with respect to any ergodic stationary measure under some smoothness assumption.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of Ordinary Differential Equations: Wall Labelings, Conley Complexes, and Ramp Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial topological framework for characterizing the global dynamics of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The approach is motivated by the study of gene regulatory networks, which are often modeled by ODEs that are not explicitly derived from first principles.
  The proposed method involves constructing a combinatorial model from a set of parameters and then embedding the model into a continuous setting in such a way that the algebraic topological invariants are preserved. In this manuscript, we build upon the software Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks (DSGRN), a software package that is used to explore the dynamics generated by a regulatory network. By extending its functionalities, we deduce the global dynamical information of the ODE and extract information regarding equilibria, periodic orbits, connecting orbits and bifurcations.
  We validate our results through algebraic topological tools and analytical bounds, and the effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through several examples and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Three forms of dimension reduction for border-collision bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For dynamical systems that switch between different modes of operation, parameter variation can cause periodic solutions to lose or acquire new switching events. When this causes the eigenvalues (stability multipliers) associated with the solution to change discontinuously, we show that if one eigenvalue remains continuous then all local invariant sets of the leading-order approximation to the system occur on a lower dimensional manifold. This allows us to analyse the dynamics with fewer variables, which is particularly helpful when the dynamics is chaotic. We compare this to two other codimension-two scenarios for which dimension reduction can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a continuous piecewise-smooth map on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is comprised of two linear functions, has a bounded orbit, and satisfies a certain non-degeneracy condition, then it has a fixed point. The result has important consequences to the bifurcation theory of nonsmooth dynamical systems, yet the proof requires only elementary linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Shadowing property for set-valued map and its inverse limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the relationship between the shadowing property of set-valued maps and their associated inverse limit systems. We show that if a set-valued map is expansive and open in the context of set-valued dynamics, then certain induced inverse limit systems have the shadowing property. Additionally, we prove that a continuous set-valued map has the shadowing property if and only if some of its induced inverse limit system also has shadowing property. Finally, we establish that the shadowing property of a set-valued map is equivalent to the shadowing property of its induced inverse set-valued system.</description>

      <title>Generic global diffusion for analytic uncoupled a priori unstable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given a general uncoupled a priori unstable Hamiltonian \[ \frac12 p^2 + V(q) + G(I) + \epsilon h(p, q, I, \varphi, t), \] where $h$ is a generic Ma\~n\'e analytic function and $\epsilon$ is small enough, there is an orbit for which the momentum $I$ changes by any arbitrarily prescribed value. We call this phenomenon as global diffusion since the size of the change in $I$ is independent of both $\epsilon$ and $h$. The fact that the pendulum and rotor variables are uncoupled is used essentially in our proof. The proof is based on simple and constructive geometrical methods, carefully studying the reduced Poincar\'e functions of the problem which generate the corresponding scattering maps.</description>

      <title>Finite type as fundamental objects even non-single-valued and non-continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadowing property for general upper semicontinuous set-valued maps defined by Pilyugin and Rieger \cite{PR}, and inspired by Good and Meddaugh \cite{GM}, we identify the fundamental objects underpinning the shadowing theory for such maps. Specifically, we explore the relationships among shifts of finite type, the simplest set-valued maps, and the shadowing property.
  Our main result establishes that if $X$ is a compact, totally disconnected Hausdorff space, and $F$ is an upper semicontinuous closed-valued map on $X$ with the set-valued shadowing property, the following hold: \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $F$ is expansive, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to a shift of finite type. \item Without expansiveness, $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of the simplest set-valued systems satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition. Additionally, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of shifts of finite type, also satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition \end{enumerate}
  As a consequence, if an upper semicontinuous set-valued map on a totally disconnected space has the set-valued shadowing property, its orbit system also exhibits the single-valued shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Interpretable low-order representation of eigenmode deformation in parameterized dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal analysis has long been consolidated as a basic tool to interpret dynamics and build low-order models of mechanical, thermal, and fluid systems. Eigenmodes arising from the spectral decomposition of the underlying linearized dynamics represent spatial patterns in vibration, temperature, or velocity fields associated with simple time dynamics. However, for systems that depend on one or more parameters, eigenmodes obtained for one set of parameter values are not necessarily dynamically relevant in other regions of parameter space. In this work, we formulate a method to obtain an optimal orthogonal basis of eigen-deformation modes (EDMs) that capture eigenmode variations across a range of parameter values. Through numerical examples of common parameterized dynamical systems in engineering, we show that EDMs are useful for parameterized model reduction and to provide physical insight into the effects of parameter changes on the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Analysis of Boid Simulations with Obstacles: A Physics-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boids, developed by Craig W. Reynolds in 1986, is one of the earliest emergent models where the global pattern emerges from the interaction between many individuals within the local scale. In the original model, Boids follow three rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion; which allow them to move around and create a flock without intention in the empty environment. In the real world, however, the Boids' movement also faces obstacles preventing the flock's direction. In this project, I propose two new simple rules of the Boids model to represent the more realistic movement in nature and analyze the model from the physics perspective using the Monte Carlo method. From those results, the physics metrics related to the forming of the flocking phenomenon show that it is reasonable to explain why birds or fishes prefer to move in a flock, rather than sole movement.</description>

      <title>Quasispecies dynamics with time lags and periodic fluctuations in replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasispecies theory provides the conceptual and theoretical bases for describing the dynamics of biological information of replicators subject to large mutation rates. This theory, initially conceived within the framework of prebiotic evolution, is also being used to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses and heterogeneous cancer cells populations. In this sense, efforts to approximate the initial quasispecies theory to more realistic scenarios have been made in recent decades. Despite this, how time lags in RNA synthesis and periodic fluctuations impact quasispecies dynamics remains poorly studied. In this article, we combine the theory of delayed ordinary differential equations and topological Leray-Schauder degree to investigate the classical quasispecies model in the single-peak fitness landscape considering time lags and periodic fluctuations in replication. First, we prove that the dynamics with time lags under the constant population constraint remains in the simplex in both forward and backward times. With backward mutation and periodic fluctuations, we prove the existence of periodic orbits regardless of time lags. Nevertheless, without backward mutation, neither periodic fluctuation nor the introduction of time lags leads to periodic orbits. However, in the case of periodic fluctuations, solutions converge exponentially to a periodic oscillation around the equilibria associated with a constant replication rate. We check the validity of the error catastrophe hypothesis assuming no backward mutation; we determine that the error threshold remains sound for the case of time of periodic fitness and time lags with constant fitness. Finally, our results show that the error threshold is not found with backward mutations.</description>

      <title>Pullback attractors for nonclassical diffusion equations with a delay operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the asymptotic behavior of weak solutions for nonclassical non-autonomous diffusion equations with a delay operator in time-dependent spaces when the nonlinear function $g$ satisfies subcritical exponent growth conditions, the delay operator $\varphi(t, u_t)$ contains some hereditary characteristics and the external force $k \in L_{l o c}^{2}\left(\mathbb{R} ; L^{2}(\Omega)\right)$. First, we prove the well-posedness of solutions by using the Faedo-Galerkin approximation method. Then after a series of elaborate energy estimates and calculations, we establish the existence and regularity of pullback attractors in time-dependent spaces $C_{\mathcal{H}_{t}(\Omega)}$ and $C_{\mathcal{H}^{1}_{t}(\Omega)}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Error Estimation and Stopping Criteria for Krylov-Based Model Order Reduction in Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the frequency range of interest, finite element-based modeling of acoustic problems leads to dynamical systems with very high dimensional state spaces. As these models can mostly be described with second order linear dynamical system with sparse matrices, mathematical model order reduction provides an interesting possibility to speed up the simulation process. In this work, we tackle the question of finding an optimal order for the reduced system, given a desired accuracy. To do so, we revisit a heuristic error estimator based on the difference of two reduced models from two consecutive Krylov iterations. We perform a mathematical analysis of the estimator and show that the difference of two consecutive reduced models does provide a sufficiently accurate estimation for the true model reduction error. This claim is supported by numerical experiments on two acoustic models. We briefly discuss its feasibility as a stopping criterion for Krylov-based model order reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relative differential closure in the context of Hardy fields. Using our earlier work on algebraic differential equations over Hardy fields, this leads to a proof of a conjecture of Boshernitzan (1981): the intersection of all maximal analytic Hardy fields agrees with that of all maximal Hardy fields. We also generalize a key ingredient in the proof, and describe a cautionary example delineating the boundaries of its applicability.</description>

Abstract: We extend the classical Otal-Peign\'e's Theorem to the class of proper, Gromov-hyperbolic spaces that are line-convex. Namely, we prove that when a group acts discretely and virtually freely by isometries on a metric space in this class then its critical exponent equals the topological entropy of the geodesic flow of the quotient metric space. We also show examples of proper, Gromov-hyperbolic spaces that are not line-convex and for which the statement fails.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Networks: A Lattice System Analysis Model Based on Structural Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the intricate interactions between particles within a system is a key approach to revealing the essential characteristics of the system, whether it is an in-depth analysis of molecular properties in the field of chemistry or the design of new materials for specific performance requirements in materials science. To this end, we propose Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Network (GAHN), a neural network method that can understand the underlying structure of lattice Hamiltonian systems solely through the dynamic trajectories of particles. We can determine which particles in the system interact with each other, the proportion of interactions between different particles, and whether the potential energy of interactions between particles exhibits even symmetry or not. The obtained structure helps the neural network model to continue predicting the trajectory of the system and further understand the dynamic properties of the system. In addition to understanding the underlying structure of the system, it can be used for detecting lattice structural abnormalities, such as link defects, abnormal interactions, etc. These insights benefit system optimization, design, and detection of aging or damage. Moreover, this approach can integrate other components to deduce the link structure needed for specific parts, showcasing its scalability and potential. We tested it on a challenging molecular dynamics dataset, and the results proved its ability to accurately infer molecular bond connectivity, highlighting its scientific research potential.</description>

      <title>A Stability Condition for Online Feedback Optimization without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a control approach to drive a dynamical plant to an optimal steady state. By interconnecting optimization algorithms with real-time plant measurements, OFO provides all the benefits of feedback control, yet without requiring exact knowledge of plant dynamics for computing a setpoint. On the downside, existing stability guarantees for OFO require the controller to evolve on a sufficiently slower timescale than the plant, possibly affecting transient performance and responsiveness to disturbances. In this paper, we prove that, under suitable conditions, OFO ensures stability without any timescale separation. In particular, the condition we propose is independent of the time constant of the plant, hence it is scaling-invariant. Our analysis leverages a composite Lyapunov function, which is the $\max$ of plant-related and controller-related components. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: State estimation in multi-layer turbulent flow fields with only a single layer of partial observation remains a challenging yet practically important task. Applications include inferring the state of the deep ocean by exploiting surface observations. Directly implementing an ensemble Kalman filter based on the full forecast model is usually expensive. One widely used method in practice projects the information of the observed layer to other layers via linear regression. However, when nonlinearity in the highly turbulent flow field becomes dominant, the regression solution will suffer from large uncertainty errors. In this paper, we develop a multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method. A sequence of nonlinear assimilation steps is applied from layer to layer recurrently. Fundamentally different from the traditional linear regression approaches, a conditional Gaussian nonlinear system is adopted as the approximate forecast model to characterize the nonlinear dependence between adjacent layers. The estimated posterior is a Gaussian mixture, which can be highly non-Gaussian. Therefore, the multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method can capture strongly turbulent features, especially intermittency and extreme events, and better quantify the inherent uncertainty. Another notable advantage of the multi-step data assimilation method is that the posterior distribution can be solved using closed-form formulae under the conditional Gaussian framework. Applications to the two-layer quasi-geostrophic system with Lagrangian data assimilation show that the multi-step method outperforms the one-step method with linear stochastic flow models, especially as the tracer number and ensemble size increase.</description>

      <title>Symplectization of certain Hamiltonian systems in fibered almost-symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an important difference between Hamiltonian-like vector fields in an almost-symplectic manifold $(M,\sigma)$, compared to the standard case of a symplectic manifold: in the almost-symplectic case, a vector field such that the contraction iX{\sigma} is closed need not be a symmetry of $\sigma$. We thus call partially-Hamiltonian those vector fields which have the former property and fully-Hamiltonian those which have both properties. We consider 2n-dimensional almost symplectic manifolds with a fibration $\pi : M \longrightarrow B$ by Lagrangian tori. Trivially, all vertical partially-Hamiltonian vector fields are fully-Hamiltonian. We investigate the existence and the properties of non-vertical fully-Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that this class is non-empty, but under certain genericity conditions that involve the Fourier spectrum of their Hamiltonian, these vector fields reduce, under a (possibly only semi-globally defined, if $n \ge 4$) torus action, to families of standard symplectic-Hamiltonian vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first known upper bounds for the packing dimension of weighted singular and weighted $\omega$-singular matrices. We also prove upper bounds for these sets when intersected with fractal subsets. The latter results, even in the unweighted setting, are already new for matrices. Further, even for row vectors, our results enlarge the class of fractals for which bounds are currently known. We use methods from homogeneous dynamics, in particular we provide upper bounds for the packing dimension of points on the space of unimodular lattices, whose orbits under diagonal flows $p$-escape on average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the circle, without external parameters, admits plenty of almost periodic solutions. Indeed, we prove that arbitrarily close to most of the finite dimensional KAM tori constructed by Kuksin--Poschel in 1996, there exist infinite dimensional non resonant Kronecker tori, i.e. rotational invariant tori. This result answers a natural and longstanding question, well identified by the Hamiltonian PDE community since the first KAM-type result for PDEs by Kuksin in 1987.</description>

Abstract: This article focuses on recent investigations on equilibria of the Frenkel-Kontorova models subjected to potentials generated by quasi-crystals. We present a specific one-dimensional model with an explicit potential driven by the Fibonacci quasi-crystal. For a given positive number $\theta$, we show that there are multiple equilibria with rotation number $\theta$, e.g., a minimal configuration and a non-minimal equilibrium configuration. Some numerical experiments verifying the existence of such equilibria are provided.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Systems Framework for Modeling COVID-19 with L\'evy Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural fluctuations have played a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of pervasive diseases such as the coronavirus. Examining the effects of irregular unsettling disturbances on epidemic models is important for understanding these dynamics. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model for the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) dynamics of the coronavirus, incorporating perturbations in the contact rate through Levy noise. The utilization of the Levy process is essential for the protection and control of diseases. We delve into the dynamics of both the deterministic model and the global positive solution of the stochastic model, establishing their existence and uniqueness. Additionally, we explore conditions for the termination and persistence of the infection. Furthermore, we derive the basic reproduction number, a critical determinant of disease extinction or persistence. Numerical results indicate that COVID-19 dissipates from the population when the reproduction number is less than one in the presence of significant or minor noise. Conversely, controlling epidemic diseases becomes challenging when the reproduction number exceeds one. To illustrate this phenomenon, we provide numerical simulations, offering insights into the dynamics of the disease and the efficacy of control measures</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, using methods from ergodic theory, Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson resolved a longstanding conjecture of Erd\H{o}s about sumsets in large subsets of the natural numbers. In this paper, we extend this result to several important classes of amenable groups, including all finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups, and all abelian groups $(G,+)$ with the property that the subgroup $2G := \{g+g : g\in G\}$ has finite index. We prove that in any group $G$ from the above classes, any $A\subset G$ with positive upper Banach density contains a shifted product set of the form $\{tb_ib_j\colon i&lt;j\}$, for some infinite sequence $(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and some $t\in G$. In fact, we show this result for all amenable groups that posses a property which we call square absolute continuity. Our results provide answers to several questions and conjectures posed in a recent survey of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson.</description>

Abstract: The Koopman operator has entered and transformed many research areas over the last years. Although the underlying concept$\unicode{x2013}$representing highly nonlinear dynamical systems by infinite-dimensional linear operators$\unicode{x2013}$has been known for a long time, the availability of large data sets and efficient machine learning algorithms for estimating the Koopman operator from data make this framework extremely powerful and popular. Koopman operator theory allows us to gain insights into the characteristic global properties of a system without requiring detailed mathematical models. We will show how these methods can also be used to analyze complex networks and highlight relationships between Koopman operators and graph Laplacians.</description>

Abstract: We prove effective equidistribution of expanding horocycles in $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to various classes of Borel probability measures on $\mathbb{R}$ having certain Fourier asymptotics. Our proof involves new techniques combining tools from automorphic forms and harmonic analysis.
  In particular, for any Borel probability measure $\mu$, satisfying $\sum_{\mathbb{Z}\ni|m|\leq X}|\widehat{\mu}(m)| = O\left(X^{1/2-\theta}\right)$ with $\theta&gt;7/64,$ our result holds. This class of measures contains convolutions of $s$-Ahlfors regular measures for $s&gt;39/64$, and as well as, a sub-class of self-similar measures. Moreover, our result is sharp upon the Ramanujan--Petersson Conjecture (upon which the above $\theta$ can be chosen arbitrarily small): there are measures $\mu$ with $\widehat\mu(\xi) = O\left(|\xi|^{-1/2+\epsilon}\right)$ for which equidistribution fails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Follow-up comment by the author:
  Theorem 2.2 in this paper is a special case of Theorems 1.1 and 4.1 in the article "Weighted thermodynamic formalism on subshifts and applications", Asian J. Math. 16 (2012), by J. Barral and D. J. Feng. In addition, Zhou Feng studied the conditions under which general self-affine fractals, including sofic sets, have the same Hausdorff dimension and box dimension in the paper "On the coincidence of the Hausdorff and box dimensions for some affine-invariant sets", arXiv:2405.03213. I would like to thank Dr. Zhou Feng for pointing out these works.
  The calculation of the exact Hausdorff dimension of sofic sets presented in this article is refined in my subsequent work "Exact Hausdorff dimension of some sofic self-affine fractals", arXiv:2412.05805.
  Original abstract:
  We establish a combinatorial expression for the Hausdorff dimension of a given self-affine fractal in any Euclidean space. This formula includes the extension of the work by Kenyon and Peres (1996) on planar sofic sets and yields an exact value for the dimension of certain sofic sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or higher. We also calculate the Minkowski dimension of sofic sets and establish a sufficient and presumably necessary condition for planar sofic sets to have the same Minkowski and Hausdorff dimension. The condition can be regarded as a generalization of the classical result for Bedford-McMullen carpets.</description>

If $f$ is area expanding, then the topological semi-conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $A$ is the topological conjugacy, and the topological conjugacy is $C^1$ along the center foliation. Furthermore, if $f$ is area expanding and the center bundle is $C^1$, then the conjugacy is smooth.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is one of the most relevant characteristics of systems of interest in nature and technology, ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle number through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we review complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying number of particles inspired by rather different specific numerical goals. As a result of the analysis on the underlying common structure of these models, we propose a unifying master equation for general dynamical systems with varying number of particles. This equation embeds all the previous models and can potentially model a much larger range of complex systems, ranging from molecular to social agent-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>State-Space Systems as Dynamic Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic framework to study the dependence structure induced by deterministic discrete-time state-space systems between input and output processes is introduced. General sufficient conditions are formulated under which output processes exist and are unique once an input process has been fixed, a property that in the deterministic state-space literature is known as the echo state property. When those conditions are satisfied, the given state-space system becomes a generative model for probabilistic dependences between two sequence spaces. Moreover, those conditions guarantee that the output depends continuously on the input when using the Wasserstein metric. The output processes whose existence is proved are shown to be causal in a specific sense and to generalize those studied in purely deterministic situations. The results in this paper constitute a significant stochastic generalization of sufficient conditions for the deterministic echo state property to hold, in the sense that the stochastic echo state property can be satisfied under contractivity conditions that are strictly weaker than those in deterministic situations. This means that state-space systems can induce a purely probabilistic dependence structure between input and output sequence spaces even when there is no functional relation between those two spaces.</description>

Abstract: We construct a point set in the Euclidean plane that elucidates the relationship between the fine-scale statistics of the fractional parts of $\sqrt n$ and directional statistics for a shifted lattice. We show that the randomly rotated, and then stretched, point set converges in distribution to a lattice-like random point process. This follows closely the arguments in Elkies and McMullen's original analysis for the gap statistics of $\sqrt{n}$ mod 1 in terms of random affine lattices [Duke Math. J. 123 (2004), 95-139]. There is, however, a curious subtlety: the limit process emerging in our construction is NOT invariant under the standard $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-action on $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>
