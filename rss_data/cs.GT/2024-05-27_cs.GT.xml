      <title>Interpretable Price Bounds Estimation with Shape Constraints in Price Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the interpretable estimation of price bounds within the context of price optimization. In recent years, price optimization methods have become indispensable for maximizing revenues and profits. However, effectively applying these methods to real-world pricing operations remains a significant challenge. It is crucial for operators, who are responsible for setting prices, to utilize reasonable price bounds that are not only interpretable but also acceptable. Despite this necessity, most studies assume that price bounds are given constant values, and few have explored the reasonable determination of these bounds. In response, we propose a comprehensive framework for determining price bounds, which includes both the estimation and adjustment of these bounds. Specifically, we first estimate the price bounds using three distinct approaches based on historical pricing data. We then adjust the estimated price bounds by solving an optimization problem that incorporates shape constraints. This method allows for the implementation of price optimization under practical and reasonable price bounds, suitable for real-world applications. We report the effectiveness of our proposed method through numerical experiments conducted with historical pricing data from actual services.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Informative Text Evaluations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</description>

      <title>When far is better: The Chamberlin-Courant approach to obnoxious committee selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical work on metric space based committee selection problem interprets distance as ``near is better''. In this work, motivated by real-life situations, we interpret distance as ``far is better''. Formally stated, we initiate the study of ``obnoxious'' committee scoring rules when the voters' preferences are expressed via a metric space. To this end, we propose a model where large distances imply high satisfaction and study the egalitarian avatar of the well-known Chamberlin-Courant voting rule and some of its generalizations. For a given integer value $1 \le \lambda \le k$, the committee size k, a voter derives satisfaction from only the $\lambda$-th favorite committee member; the goal is to maximize the satisfaction of the least satisfied voter. For the special case of $\lambda = 1$, this yields the egalitarian Chamberlin-Courant rule. In this paper, we consider general metric space and the special case of a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space.
  We show that when $\lambda$ is $1$ and $k$, the problem is polynomial-time solvable in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and general metric space, respectively. However, for $\lambda = k-1$, it is NP-hard even in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, we have ``double-dichotomy'' in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to the value of {\lambda}, where the extreme cases are solvable in polynomial time but an intermediate case is NP-hard. Furthermore, this phenomenon appears to be ``tight'' for $\mathbb{R}^2$ because the problem is NP-hard for general metric space, even for $\lambda=1$. Consequently, we are motivated to explore the problem in the realm of (parameterized) approximation algorithms and obtain positive results. Interestingly, we note that this generalization of Chamberlin-Courant rules encodes practical constraints that are relevant to solutions for certain facility locations.</description>

      <title>Search and Matching for Adoption from Foster Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To find families for the more than 100,000 children in need of adoptive placements, most United States child welfare agencies have employed a family-driven search strategy in which prospective families respond to announcements made by the agency. However, some agencies have switched to a caseworker-driven search strategy in which the caseworker directly contacts families recommended for a child. We introduce a novel search-and-matching model to capture essential aspects of the adoption process and compare the two approaches through a game-theoretical analysis. We show that the search equilibria induced by threshold strategies form a lattice structure under either approach. Our main theoretical result establishes that the equilibrium outcomes in family-driven search can never Pareto dominate the outcomes in caseworker-driven search, but it is possible that each caseworker-driven search outcome Pareto dominates all family-driven search outcomes. We also find that when families are sufficiently impatient, caseworker-driven search is better for all children. We illustrate numerically that most agents are better off under caseworker-driven search for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we provide empirical evidence from an agency that switched to caseworker-driven search and achieved a three-year adoption probability that outperformed a statewide benchmark by 17%.</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Equilibria and Mechanisms via Learning in Zero-Sum Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for computing optimal equilibria via learning in games. It applies to extensive-form settings with any number of players, including mechanism design, information design, and solution concepts such as correlated, communication, and certification equilibria. We observe that optimal equilibria are minimax equilibrium strategies of a player in an extensive-form zero-sum game. This reformulation allows to apply techniques for learning in zero-sum games, yielding the first learning dynamics that converge to optimal equilibria, not only in empirical averages, but also in iterates. We demonstrate the practical scalability and flexibility of our approach by attaining state-of-the-art performance in benchmark tabular games, and by computing an optimal mechanism for a sequential auction design problem using deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Markov Games: A Single Time-scale Algorithm Under Weak Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider decentralized learning for zero-sum games, where players only see their payoff information and are agnostic to actions and payoffs of the opponent. Previous works demonstrated convergence to a Nash equilibrium in this setting using double time-scale algorithms under strong reachability assumptions. We address the open problem of achieving an approximate Nash equilibrium efficiently with an uncoupled and single time-scale algorithm under weaker conditions. Our contribution is a rational and convergent algorithm, utilizing Tsallis-entropy regularization in a value-iteration-based approach. The algorithm learns an approximate Nash equilibrium in polynomial time, requiring only the existence of a policy pair that induces an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain, thus considerably weakening past assumptions. Our analysis leverages negative drift inequalities and introduces novel properties of Tsallis entropy that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Resolution Boundary of Outcome-Based Imperfect-Recall Abstraction in Games with Ordered Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the development of advanced Texas Hold'em AI systems, abstraction technology has garnered widespread attention due to its significant effect in simplifying game complexity. This study adopts a more specific model, the games of ordered signal, to describe Texas Hold'em-style games and optimizes this model to streamline its mathematical representation and broaden its applicability. By transitioning from a broad imperfect information game model to a game with ordered signals model, we have separated the previously intertwined infoset abstraction and action abstraction into independent signal abstraction and action abstraction. Importantly, this signal abstraction provides a mathematical framework for the hand abstraction task, which is emphatically discussed in this paper. Additionally, a novel common refinement principle is introduced, revealing the limit performance of hand abstraction algorithms. We introduce potential outcome isomorphism (POI) and pinpoint that it suffers from the issue of excessive abstraction. Futher, We demonstrate that POI serves as a common refinement for leading outcome-based hand abstraction algorithms, such as E[HS] and PA\&amp;PAEMD. Consequently, excessive abstraction also inherently affects these algorithms, leading to suboptimal performance. Our investigation reveals the omission of historical data as a primary contributor to excessive abstraction. To remedy this, we propose the K-Recall Outcome Isomorphism (KROI) to incorporate the missing information. Compared with POI, KROI more accurately mirrors lossless isomorphism (LI), the ground truth, offering enhanced signal abstraction resolution. Experimental results in the Numeral211 Hold'em indicate that strategies developed through KROI approximate the exploitability of those developed through LI more closely than those trained through POI.</description>

      <title>Economic DAO Governance: A Contestable Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value than inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it distributes surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties.</description>

      <title>Proportional Fairness in Clustering: A Social Choice Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the proportional clustering problem of Chen et al. [ICML'19] and relate it to the area of multiwinner voting in computational social choice. We show that any clustering satisfying a weak proportionality notion of Brill and Peters [EC'23] simultaneously obtains the best known approximations to the proportional fairness notion of Chen et al. [ICML'19], but also to individual fairness [Jung et al., FORC'20] and the "core" [Li et al. ICML'21]. In fact, we show that any approximation to proportional fairness is also an approximation to individual fairness and vice versa. Finally, we also study stronger notions of proportional representation, in which deviations do not only happen to single, but multiple candidate centers, and show that stronger proportionality notions of Brill and Peters [EC'23] imply approximations to these stronger guarantees.</description>

      <title>Positional $\omega$-regular languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of two-player games over graphs, a language $L$ is called positional if, in all games using $L$ as winning objective, the protagonist can play optimally using positional strategies, that is, strategies that do not depend on the history of the play. In this work, we describe the class of parity automata recognising positional languages, providing a complete characterisation of positionality for $\omega$-regular languages. As corollaries, we establish decidability of positionality in polynomial time, finite-to-infinite and 1-to-2-players lifts, and show the closure under union of prefix-independent positional objectives, answering a conjecture by Kopczy\'nski in the $\omega$-regular case.</description>
