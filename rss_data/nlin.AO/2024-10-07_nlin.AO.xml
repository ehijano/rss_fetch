      <title>Stability of the 1d swarmalator model in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 1d swarmalator model in the continuum limit. We examine the stability of its collective states which have compact support: synchrony, where the swarmalators lie in two sync dots (zero dimensional support), and the phase wave, where the swarmalators line up in a ring with uniformly spaced positions and phases (one dimensional support). The compact support imposes analytic difficulties that occur in many other swarmalator models and thus is blocking progress in the field. We show how to overcome this difficulty, deriving the two states' stability spectra exactly.</description>

      <title>Acoustic signaling enables collective perception and control in active matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.</description>

      <title>Never Mind The No-Ops: Faster and Less Volatile Simulation Modelling of Co-Evolutionary Species Interactions via Spatial Cyclic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Issues in co-evolutionary population dynamics have long been studied via computationally intensive simulations of minimally simple agent-based models, known as Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games (ESCGs), involving multiple interacting biological species in which each agent has its own unique spatial location in a cell on a regular lattice, and can move from cell to cell over time. Many papers have been published exploring the dynamics of ESCGs where competitive inter-species predator/prey relationships are modelled via the cyclic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) for three species, or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) for five. At the core of these simulations is the "Elementary Step" (ES), in which one or two agents are chosen at random to either compete to the death, or to reproduce, or to move location. ESCG studies typically involve executing trillions of ESs and hence the computational efficiency of the core ES algorithm is a key concern. In this paper I demonstrate that the de facto standard "Original ES" (OES) algorithm is computationally inefficient both in time and in space due to the implicit execution of many "no-op" commands (i.e., commands that do nothing) and because at steady state large numbers of cells can be empty, and yet empty cells serve no purpose. I present a new "Revised ES" (RES) algorithm which eliminates these inefficiencies, and I show empirically that ESCGs with RES exhibit qualitatively the same characteristics as those with OES, and are also markedly more stable. The more stable dynamics of RES-based simulations means that they can be run with smaller lattices than when using OES, leading to reductions in total simulation times of 85% or more. Python source code developed for the experiments reported here is freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a large ensemble of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with heterogeneous input currents and adaptation variables. For a particular class of adaptation, which we call quadratic spike-frequency adaptation (QSFA), the high-dimensional system admits an exact reduction to a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for three mean-field variables: the population's firing rate, the mean membrane potential, and a mean adaptation variable. These low-dimensional firing rate equations (FRE) reveal an important generic feature of heterogeneous networks with spike frequency adaptation: Both the center and the width of the distribution of the neurons' firing frequencies are reduced, and this largely favors the emergence of collective synchronization in the network. These results are confirmed by the bifurcation analysis of the FRE, which faithfully describe the collective dynamics of the spiking neuron network, including collective oscillations, bursting, and macroscopic chaos.</description>

      <title>Deeper but smaller: Higher-order interactions increase linear stability but shrink basins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge of nonlinear dynamics and network science is to understand how higher-order interactions influence collective dynamics. Although many studies have approached this question through linear stability analysis, less is known about how higher-order interactions shape the global organization of different states. Here, we shed light on this issue by analyzing the rich patterns supported by identical Kuramoto oscillators on hypergraphs. We show that higher-order interactions can have opposite effects on linear stability and basin stability: they stabilize twisted states (including full synchrony) by improving their linear stability, but also make them hard to find by dramatically reducing their basin size. Our results highlight the importance of understanding higher-order interactions from both local and global perspectives.</description>

      <title>Birth, Death, and Horizontal Flight: Malthusian flocks with an easy plane in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I formulate the theory of three dimensional "Malthusian flocks" -- i.e., coherently moving collections of self-propelled entities (such as living creatures) which are being "born" and "dying" during their motion -- whose constituents all have a preference for having their velocity vectors lie parallel to the same two-dimensional plane. I determine the universal scaling exponents characterizing such systems exactly, finding that the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$, the "anisotropy" exponent $\zeta=3/4$, and the "roughness" exponent $\chi=-1/2$. I also give the scaling laws implied by these exponents.</description>
