      <title>An Asymptotically-Correct Implicit-Explicit Time Integration Scheme for Finite Volume Radiation-Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) for non-relativistic flows is a challenging problem because it encompasses processes acting over a very broad range of timescales, and where the relative importance of these processes often varies by orders of magnitude across the computational domain. Here we present a new implicit-explicit (IMEX) method for numerical RHD that has a number of desirable properties that have not previously been combined in a single method. Our scheme is based on moments and allows machine-precision conservation of energy and momentum, making it highly suitable for adaptive mesh refinement applications; it requires no more communication than hydrodynamics and includes no non-local iterative steps, making it highly suitable for massively parallel and GPU-based systems where communication is a bottleneck; and we show that it is asymptotically-accurate in the streaming, static diffusion, and dynamic diffusion limits, including in the so-called asymptotic diffusion regime where the computational grid does not resolve the photon mean free path. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and show that it passes a wide range of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Enabling Science from the Rubin Alert Stream with Lasair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lasair is the UK Community Broker for transient alerts from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We explain the system's capabilities, how users can achieve their scientific goals, and how Lasair is implemented. Lasair offers users a kit of parts that they can use to build filters to concentrate their desired alerts. The kit has novel lightcurve features, sky context, watchlists of special sky objects and regions of the sky, dynamic crossmatching with catalogues of known astronomical sources, and classifications and annotations from other users and partner projects. These resources can be shared with other users, copied, and modified. Lasair offers real-time machine-to-machine notifications of filtered transient alerts. Even though the Rubin Observatory is not yet complete, Lasair is a mature system: it has been processing and serving data from the similarly formatted stream of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alerts.</description>

      <title>Estimate of force noise from electrostatic patch potentials in LISA Pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses force noise in LISA and LISA Pathfinder arising from the interaction of patch potentials on the test mass and surrounding electrode housing surfaces with their own temporal fluctuations. We aim to estimate the contribution of this phenomenon to the force noise detected in LISA Pathfinder in excess of the background from Brownian motion. We introduce a model of that approximates the interacting test mass and housing surfaces as concentric spheres, treating patch potentials as isotropic stochastic Gaussian processes on the surface of these spheres. We find that a scenario of patches due to surface contamination, with diffusion driven density fluctuations, could indeed produce force noise with the observed frequency $f^{-2}$ dependence. However there is not enough experimental evidence, neither from LISA Pathfinder itself, nor from other experiments, to predict the amplitude of such a noise, which could range from completely negligible to explaining the entire noise excess. We briefly discuss several measures to ensure that this noise is sufficiently small in LISA .</description>

      <title>Great Observatory for Long Wavelengths (GO-LoW) NIAC Phase I Final Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-frequency sky below $\sim$15 MHz (20 m) is obscured by the Earth's ionosphere, the layer of charged particles above the neutral atmosphere. Single spacecraft have made measurements in this band, but cannot achieve high or even moderate angular resolution because a telescope's resolution ($\theta$) is set by $\theta = \lambda/D$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $D$ is the telescope diameter. For wavelengths that range from tens of meters to kilometers, a telescope must be hundreds of meters to many kilometers in diameter for even moderate resolution.
  The Great Observatory for Long Wavelengths (GO-LoW) is an interferometric mega-constellation space telescope operating between 300 kHz and 15 MHz. In a departure from the traditional approach of a single, large, expensive spacecraft (e.g., HST, Chandra, JWST), GO-LoW is an interferometric Great Observatory comprising thousands of small, inexpensive, and reconfigurable nodes.
  A distributed constellation of sensing elements provides (1) reliability and robustness to failures, (2) longevity by allowing for growth over time and infusion of new technology via staged replacement of nodes, (3) reduced costs through leveraging mass production, and (4) formation reconfigurability to optimize the observatory for diverse science cases.
  A low-frequency mega-constellation revolutionizes a number of compelling science cases: high-resolution all-sky mapping, Dark Ages/Epoch of Reionization cosmology, interstellar medium mapping, solar/planetary magnetic activity, and exoplanetary magnetospheric radio emission.
  This report summarizes GO-LoW's concept development under NASA's NIAC Phase I program. We discuss antenna design and sensitivity, constellation architecture, including communication and launch infrastructure, interferometric correlation and a technology roadmap.</description>

      <title>Solar photospheric spectrum microvariability II. Observed relations to magnetic activity and radial-velocity modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for small exoplanets around solar-type stars are limited by stellar physical variability. While chromospheric variability is well studied, observing, modeling. and understanding the much smaller fluctuations in photospheric spectral line strengths, shapes, and shifts is challenging. Extreme precision radial-velocity spectrometers now enable extreme precision stellar spectroscopy and time series of the Sun seen as a star permit monitoring of its photospheric variability. Fluctuations in their line strengths may well correlate with radial-velocity excursions and identify observable proxies for their monitoring. From three years of HARPS-N observations of the Sun-as-a-star, one thousand low-noise spectra are selected, and line absorption measured in Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Mn I, H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, Na I, and the G-band. Their variations and likely atmospheric origins are examined, also with respect to simultaneously measured chromospheric emission and apparent radial velocity. Systematic line-strength variability is seen, largely shadowing the solar-cycle evolution of Ca II H &amp; K emission, but with smaller amounts, typically on a sub-percent level. Among iron lines, greatest amplitudes are for Fe II in the blue, while the trends change sign among differently strong lines in the green Mg I triplet and between Balmer lines. Variations in the G-band core are greater than of the full G-band, in line with theoretical predictions. No variation is detected in the semi-forbidden Mg I 457.1 nm. Hyperfine split Mn I behaves largely similar to Fe I. For lines at longer wavelengths, telluric absorption limits the achievable precision. Microvariability in the solar photospheric spectrum thus displays systematic signatures among various features. These measure something different than the classical Ca II H &amp; K index while still reflecting a strong influence from magnetic regions.</description>

      <title>A generalizable method for estimating meteor shower false positives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The determination of meteor shower or parent body associations is inherently a statistical problem. Traditional methods, primarily the similarity discriminants, have limitations, particularly in handling the increasing volume and complexity of meteoroid orbit data.
  Aims. We aim to introduce a new, more statistically robust and generalizable method for estimating false positive detections in meteor shower identification, leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
  Methods. Utilizing a dataset of 824 fireballs observed by the European Fireball Network, we apply a multivariate Gaussian kernel within KDE and z-score data normalization. Our method analyzes the parameter space of meteoroid orbits and geocentric impact characteristics, focusing on four different similarity discriminants: DSH, D', DH, and DN.
  Results. The KDE methodology consistently converges towards a true established shower-associated fireball rate within the EFN dataset of 18-25% for all criteria. This indicates that the approach provides a more statistically robust estimate of the shower-associated component.
  Conclusions. Our findings highlight the potential of KDE, combined with appropriate data normalization, in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of meteor shower analysis. This method addresses the existing challenges posed by traditional similarity discriminants and offers a versatile solution adaptable to varying datasets and parameters.</description>

      <title>A Coordinate-Independent Formalism for Detecting High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an external electric or magnetic field, a gravitational wave (GW) may be converted into electromagnetic radiation. We present a coordinate-invariant framework to describe the GW signal in a detector that is based on this effect, such as cavities for axion searches. In this framework, we pay special attention to the definition of manifestly coordinate-independent expressions for the electromagnetic fields that an external observer would detect. A careful assessment of the detector's perceived motion allows us to treat both its mechanical and its electromagnetic response to the GW consistently. We further introduce well-defined approximations for which this motion may be neglected, and hence provide suggestions on which coordinate frame is suitable to characterise the GW signal in practice. We illustrate our findings in two examples, an infinitesimally thin rod and a spherical electromagnetic cavity.</description>

      <title>Fast Waveform Generation for Gravitational Waves using Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave analyses depend heavily on waveforms that model the evolution of compact binary coalescences as seen by observing detectors. In many cases these waveforms are given by waveform approximants, models that approximate the power of the waveform at a set of frequencies. Because of their omnipresence, improving the speed at which approximants can generate waveforms is crucial to accelerating the overall analysis of gravitational-wave detections. An optimisation algorithm is proposed that can select at which frequencies in the spectrum an approximant should compute the power of a waveform, and at which frequencies the power can be safely interpolated at a minor loss in accuracy. The algorithm used is an evolutionary algorithm modeled after the principle of natural selection, iterating frequency arrays that perform better at every iteration. As an application, the candidates proposed by the algorithm are used to reconstruct signal-to-noise ratios. It is shown that the IMRPhenomXPHM approximant can be sped up by at least 30% at a loss of at most 2.87% on the drawn samples, measured by the accuracy of the reconstruction of signal-to-noise ratios. The behaviour of the algorithm as well as lower bounds on both speedup and error are explored, leading to a proposed proof of concept candidate that obtains a speedup of 46% with a maximum error of 0.5% on a sample of the parameter space used.</description>

      <title>The ZTF Source Classification Project: III. A Catalog of Variable Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of variable objects provides insight into a wide variety of astrophysics ranging from stellar interiors to galactic nuclei. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) provides time series observations that record the variability of more than a billion sources. The scale of these data necessitates automated approaches to make a thorough analysis. Building on previous work, this paper reports the results of the ZTF Source Classification Project (SCoPe), which trains neural network and XGBoost machine learning (ML) algorithms to perform dichotomous classification of variable ZTF sources using a manually constructed training set containing 170,632 light curves. We find that several classifiers achieve high precision and recall scores, suggesting the reliability of their predictions for 209,991,147 light curves across 77 ZTF fields. We also identify the most important features for XGB classification and compare the performance of the two ML algorithms, finding a pattern of higher precision among XGB classifiers. The resulting classification catalog is available to the public, and the software developed for SCoPe is open-source and adaptable to future time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.

      <title>Multi-messenger prospects for black hole - neutron star mergers in the O4 and O5 runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of merging black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries has been ascertained through the observation of their gravitational wave (GW) signals. However, to date, no definitive electromagnetic (EM) emission has been confidently associated with these mergers. Such an association could help unravel crucial information on these systems, for example, their BH spin distribution, the equation of state (EoS) of NS and the rate of heavy element production. We model the multi-messenger (MM) emission from BHNS mergers detectable during the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GW detector network, in order to provide detailed predictions that can help enhance the effectiveness of observational efforts and extract the highest possible scientific information from such remarkable events. Our methodology is based on a population synthesis-approach, which includes the modelling of the signal-to-noise ratio of the GW signal in the detectors, the GW-inferred sky localization of the source, the kilonova (KN) optical and near-infrared light curves, the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission peak photon flux, and the GRB afterglow light curves in the radio, optical and X-ray bands. The resulting prospects for BHNS MM detections during O4 are not promising, with a GW detection rate of $15.0^{+15.4}_{-8.8}$ yr$^{-1}$, but joint MM rates of $\sim 10^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the KN and $\sim 10^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the jet-related emission. In O5 we find an overall increase in expected detection rates by around an order of magnitude, owing to both the enhanced sensitivity of the GW detector network, and the coming online of future EM facilities. Finally, we discuss direct searches for the GRB radio afterglow with large-field-of-view instruments as a new possible follow-up strategy in the context of ever-dimming prospects for KN detection.</description>
