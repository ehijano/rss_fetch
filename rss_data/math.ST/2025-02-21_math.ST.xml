      <title>Finite sample bounds for barycenter estimation in geodesic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the barycenter of a distribution given i.i.d. data in a geodesic space. Assuming an upper curvature bound in Alexandrov's sense and a support condition ensuring the strong geodesic convexity of the barycenter problem, we establish finite-sample error bounds in expectation and with high probability. Our results generalize Hoeffding- and Bernstein-type concentration inequalities from Euclidean to geodesic spaces.</description>

      <title>Sharp Phase Transitions in Estimation with Low-Degree Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional planted problems, such as finding a hidden dense subgraph within a random graph, often exhibit a gap between statistical and computational feasibility. While recovering the hidden structure may be statistically possible, it is conjectured to be computationally intractable in certain parameter regimes. A powerful approach to understanding this hardness involves proving lower bounds on the efficacy of low-degree polynomial algorithms. We introduce new techniques for establishing such lower bounds, leading to novel results across diverse settings: planted submatrix, planted dense subgraph, the spiked Wigner model, and the stochastic block model. Notably, our results address the estimation task -- whereas most prior work is limited to hypothesis testing -- and capture sharp phase transitions such as the "BBP" transition in the spiked Wigner model (named for Baik, Ben Arous, and P\'{e}ch\'{e}) and the Kesten-Stigum threshold in the stochastic block model. Existing work on estimation either falls short of achieving these sharp thresholds or is limited to polynomials of very low (constant or logarithmic) degree. In contrast, our results rule out estimation with polynomials of degree $n^{\delta}$ where $n$ is the dimension and $\delta &gt; 0$ is a constant, and in some cases we pin down the optimal constant $\delta$. Our work resolves open problems posed by Hopkins &amp; Steurer (2017) and Schramm &amp; Wein (2022), and provides rigorous support within the low-degree framework for conjectures by Abbe &amp; Sandon (2018) and Lelarge &amp; Miolane (2019).</description>

      <title>High-dimensional random landscapes: from typical to large deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these notes we discuss tools and concepts that emerge when studying high-dimensional random landscapes, i.e., random functions on high-dimensional spaces. As an example, we consider a high-dimensional inference problem in two forms: matrix denoising (Case 1) and tensor denoising (Case 2). We show how to map the inference problem onto the optimization problem of a high-dimensional landscape, which exhibits distinct geometrical properties in the two Cases. We discuss methods for characterizing typical realizations of these landscapes and their optimization through local dynamics. We conclude by highlighting connections between the landscape problem and Large Deviation Theory.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction under L\'evy-Prokhorov Distribution Shifts: Robustness to Local and Global Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a powerful framework for constructing prediction intervals with finite-sample guarantees, yet its robustness under distribution shifts remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this limitation by modeling distribution shifts using L\'evy-Prokhorov (LP) ambiguity sets, which capture both local and global perturbations. We provide a self-contained overview of LP ambiguity sets and their connections to popular metrics such as Wasserstein and Total Variation. We show that the link between conformal prediction and LP ambiguity sets is a natural one: by propagating the LP ambiguity set through the scoring function, we reduce complex high-dimensional distribution shifts to manageable one-dimensional distribution shifts, enabling exact quantification of worst-case quantiles and coverage. Building on this analysis, we construct robust conformal prediction intervals that remain valid under distribution shifts, explicitly linking LP parameters to interval width and confidence levels. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum computer formulation of the FKP-operator eigenvalue problem for probabilistic learning on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing formulation to address a challenging problem in the development of probabilistic learning on manifolds (PLoM). It involves solving the spectral problem of the high-dimensional Fokker-Planck (FKP) operator, which remains beyond the reach of classical computing. Our ultimate goal is to develop an efficient approach for practical computations on quantum computers. For now, we focus on an adapted formulation tailored to quantum computing. The methodological aspects covered in this work include the construction of the FKP equation, where the invariant probability measure is derived from a training dataset, and the formulation of the eigenvalue problem for the FKP operator. The eigen equation is transformed into a Schr\"odinger equation with a potential V, a non-algebraic function that is neither simple nor a polynomial representation. To address this, we propose a methodology for constructing a multivariate polynomial approximation of V, leveraging polynomial chaos expansion within the Gaussian Sobolev space. This approach preserves the algebraic properties of the potential and adapts it for quantum algorithms. The quantum computing formulation employs a finite basis representation, incorporating second quantization with creation and annihilation operators. Explicit formulas for the Laplacian and potential are derived and mapped onto qubits using Pauli matrix expressions. Additionally, we outline the design of quantum circuits and the implementation of measurements to construct and observe specific quantum states. Information is extracted through quantum measurements, with eigenstates constructed and overlap measurements evaluated using universal quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis and Practical Evaluation of Jump Rate Estimators in Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer a powerful stochastic modeling framework that combines deterministic trajectories with random perturbations at random times. Estimating their local characteristics (particularly the jump rate) is an important yet challenging task. In recent years, non-parametric methods for jump rate inference have been developed, but these approaches often rely on distinct theoretical frameworks, complicating direct comparisons. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to standardize and consolidate state-of-the-art approaches. We establish new results on consistency and asymptotic normality within this framework, enabling rigorous theoretical comparisons of convergence rates and asymptotic variances. Notably, we demonstrate that no single method uniformly outperforms the others, even within the same model. These theoretical insights are validated through numerical simulations using a representative PDMP application: the TCP model. Furthermore, we extend the comparison to real-world data, focusing on cell growth and division dynamics in Escherichia coli. This work enhances the theoretical understanding of PDMP inference while offering practical insights into the relative strengths and limitations of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multivariate Robust Mean Estimation Under Mean-Shift Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of robust mean estimation of an identity covariance Gaussian in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In this contamination model, we are given a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated i.i.d. via the following process. For a parameter $\alpha&lt;1/2$, the $i$-th sample $x_i$ is obtained as follows: with probability $1-\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, I)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the target mean; and with probability $\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(z_i, I)$, where $z_i$ is unknown and potentially arbitrary. Prior work characterized the information-theoretic limits of this task. Specifically, it was shown that, in contrast to Huber contamination, in the presence of mean-shift contamination consistent estimation is possible. On the other hand, all known robust estimators in the mean-shift model have running times exponential in the dimension. Here we give the first computationally efficient algorithm for high-dimensional robust mean estimation with mean-shift contamination that can tolerate a constant fraction of outliers. In particular, our algorithm has near-optimal sample complexity, runs in sample-polynomial time, and approximates the target mean to any desired accuracy. Conceptually, our result contributes to a growing body of work that studies inference with respect to natural noise models lying in between fully adversarial and random settings.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Full-information Online Learning: from Finite to Infinite Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analysis of Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling with a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature has a $\mathcal{O}(\beta\sqrt{T\log(1+\lambda)})$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz~adversary.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of adaptive designs through differentiability in quadratic mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13387v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist multiple regression applications in engineering, industry and medicine where the outcomes follow an adaptive experimental design in which the next measurement depends on the previous observations, so that the observations are not conditionally independent given the covariates. In the existing literature on such adaptive designs, results asserting asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator require regularity conditions involving the second or third derivatives of the log-likelihood. Here we instead extend the theory of differentiability in quadratic mean (DQM) to the setting of adaptive designs, which requires strictly fewer regularity assumptions than the classical theory. In doing so, we discover a new DQM assumption, which we call summable differentiability in quadratic mean (S-DQM). As applications, we first verify asymptotic normality for two classical adaptive designs, namely the Bruceton 'up-and-down' design and the Robbins-Monro design. Next, we consider a more complicated problem, namely a Markovian version of the Langlie design.</description>

      <title>Estimation of subcritical Galton Watson processes with correlated immigration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an observed subcritical Galton Watson process $\{Y_n,\ n\in  \mathbb{Z} \}$ with correlated stationary immigration process $\{\epsilon_n,\ n\in  \mathbb{Z}  \}$. Two situations are presented. The first one is when $\mbox{Cov}(\epsilon_0,\epsilon_k)=0$ for $k$ larger than some $k_0$: a consistent estimator for the reproduction and mean immigration rates is given, and a central limit theorem is proved. The second one is when $\{\epsilon_n,\ n\in  \mathbb{Z}  \}$ has general correlation structure: under mixing assumptions, we exhibit an estimator for the the logarithm of the reproduction rate and we prove that it converges in quadratic mean with explicit speed. In addition, when the mixing coefficients decrease fast enough, we provide and prove a two terms expansion for the estimator. Numerical illustrations are provided.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Spectral Estimator and MLE for Orthogonal Group Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal group synchronization aims to recover orthogonal group elements from their noisy pairwise measurements. It has found numerous applications including computer vision, imaging science, and community detection. Due to the orthogonal constraints, it is often challenging to find the least squares estimator in presence of noise. In the recent years, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and spectral methods have proven to be powerful tools in recovering the group elements. In particular, under additive Gaussian noise, the SDR exactly produces the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and both MLE and spectral methods are able to achieve near-optimal statistical error. In this work, we take one step further to quantify the uncertainty of the MLE and spectral estimators by considering their distributions. By leveraging the orthogonality constraints in the likelihood function, we obtain a second-order expansion of the MLE and spectral estimator with the leading terms as an anti-symmetric Gaussian random matrix that is on the tangent space of the orthogonal matrix. This also implies state-of-the-art min-max risk bounds and a confidence region of each group element as a by-product. Our works provide a general theoretical framework that is potentially useful to find an approximate distribution of the estimators arising from many statistical inference problems with manifold constraints. The numerical experiments confirm our theoretical contribution.</description>

      <title>Totally Concave Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape constraints in nonparametric regression provide a powerful framework for estimating regression functions under realistic assumptions without tuning parameters. However, most existing methods$\unicode{x2013}$except additive models$\unicode{x2013}$impose too weak restrictions, often leading to overfitting in high dimensions. Conversely, additive models can be too rigid, failing to capture covariate interactions. This paper introduces a novel multivariate shape-constrained regression approach based on total concavity, originally studied by T. Popoviciu. Our method allows interactions while mitigating the curse of dimensionality, with convergence rates that depend only logarithmically on the number of covariates. We characterize and compute the least squares estimator over totally concave functions, derive theoretical guarantees, and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through empirical studies on real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the quantile process based on iid sampling to converge in distribution in $L^1(0,1)$. The condition is that the quantile function is locally absolutely continuous on the open unit interval and satisfies a slight strengthening of square integrability. We further establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the P-P process based on iid sampling from two populations to converge in distribution in $L^1(0,1)$. The condition is that the P-P curve is locally absolutely continuous on the open unit interval. If either process converges in distribution then it may be approximated using the bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Inference in semiparametric formation models for directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a semiparametric model for dyadic link formations in directed networks. The model contains a set of degree parameters that measure different effects of popularity or outgoingness across nodes, a regression parameter vector that reflects the homophily effect resulting from the nodal attributes or pairwise covariates associated with edges, and a set of latent random noises with unknown distributions. Our interest lies in inferring the unknown degree parameters and homophily parameters. The dimension of the degree parameters increases with the number of nodes. Under the high-dimensional regime, we develop a kernel-based least squares approach to estimate the unknown parameters. The major advantage of our estimator is that it does not encounter the incidental parameter problem for the homophily parameters. We prove consistency of all the resulting estimators of the degree parameters and homophily parameters. We establish high-dimensional central limit theorems for the proposed estimators and provide several applications of our general theory, including testing the existence of degree heterogeneity, testing sparse signals and recovering the support. Simulation studies and a real data application are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-type and Bennett-type inequalities for unbounded matrix martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit Bernstein-type and Bennett-type concentration inequalities for matrix-valued martingale processes with unbounded observations from the Hermitian space $\mathbb{H}(d)$. Specifically, we assume that the $\psi_{\alpha}$-Orlicz (quasi-)norms of their difference process are bounded for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. Further, we generalize the obtained result by replacing the ambient dimension $d$ with the effective rank of the covariance of the observations. To illustrate the applicability of the results, we prove several corollaries, including an empirical version of Bernstein's inequality and an extension of the bounded difference inequality, also known as McDiarmid's inequality.</description>

      <title>Mixing Phases and Metastability for the Glauber Dynamics on the p-Spin Curie-Weiss Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Glauber dynamics for the classical $2$-spin Curie-Weiss model on $N$ nodes with inverse temperature $\beta$ and zero external field is known to mix in time $\Theta(N\log N)$ for $\beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, in time $\Theta(N^{3/2})$ at $\beta = \frac{1}{2}$, and in time $\exp(\Omega(N))$ for $\beta &gt;\frac{1}{2}$. In this paper, we consider the $p$-spin generalization of the Curie-Weiss model with an external field $h$, and identify three disjoint regions almost exhausting the parameter space, with the corresponding Glauber dynamics exhibiting three different orders of mixing times in these regions. The construction of these disjoint regions depends on the number of local maximizers of a certain function $H_{\beta,h,p}$, and the behavior of the second derivative of $H_{\beta,h,p}$ at such a local maximizer. Specifically, we show that if $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has a unique local maximizer $m_*$ with $H_{\beta,h,p}''(m_*) &lt; 0$ and no other stationary point, then the Glauber dynamics mixes in time $\Theta(N\log N)$, and if $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has multiple local maximizers, then the mixing time is $\exp(\Omega(N))$. Finally, if $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has a unique local maximizer $m_*$ with $H_{\beta,h,p}''(m_*) = 0$, then the mixing time is $\Theta(N^{3/2})$. We provide an explicit description of the geometry of these three different phases in the parameter space, and observe that the only portion of the parameter plane that is left out by the union of these three regions, is a one-dimensional curve, on which the function $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has a stationary inflection point. Finding out the exact order of the mixing time on this curve remains an open question. Finally, we show that if $H_{\beta,h,p}$ has multiple local maximizers (metastable states), then one can create a restricted version of the original Glauber dynamics, which still mixes in time $\Theta(N\log N)$.</description>
