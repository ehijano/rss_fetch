      <title>Comparison estimates on nonsmooth spaces with integrable Ricci lower bounds via localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study comparison estimates on metric measure spaces admitting a synthetic variable Ricci curvature lower bound. We obtain geometric and functional inequalities assuming that the deficit of the lower bound from a given constant is sufficiently integrable. More precisely, we extend to the nonsmooth setting the Bishop-Gromov comparison, the Myers' diameter estimate and the Cheng's comparison principle for Dirichlet eigenvalues. Our analysis relies on the localization method and on one-dimensional comparison estimates for nonsmooth weighted intervals.</description>

      <title>Distinct dimensions for attractors of bi-Lipschitz iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an iterated function system on the line consisting of two bi-Lipschitz contractions whose attractor has distinct lower, Hausdorff, lower box, upper box, and Assouad dimensions, thereby providing negative answers to certain folklore questions.
  Furthermore, as a by-product of our study of bi-Lipschitz IFSs, we construct IFSs within this family that exhibit interesting fractal behaviour. In particular, we prove the following two statements: (i) There exists a bi-Lipschitz IFS for which the pushforward of any ergodic measure with positive entropy is not exact dimensional; (ii) There exists a bi-Lipschitz IFS whose attractor has empty interior yet positive Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Slicing Wasserstein Over Wasserstein Via Functional Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional $L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.</description>

      <title>Wulff Isoperimetry on Cayley Graphs: Submodular BV, Tempered F{\o}lner, and Profile Ratio Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a BV framework on Cayley graphs, which yields a sharp discrete Wulff isoperimetric inequality with the best constant tied to the generating set/stencil $S$, a quantitative $\Gamma$-convergence of discrete to continuum anisotropic perimeter, and a gauge construction in Heisenberg group that neutralizes shear, yielding an BV+shear identity and scale-sharp compactness.
  As an application we revisit a question of Gromov (2008) on the ratio between the isoperimetric profile and its greatest nondecreasing minorant. We show that this is uniformly bounded on non-amenable and two-ended groups, and our Wulff inequality and $\Gamma$-convergence give a constant-tracked proof for virtually nilpotent groups. We isolate a Tempered F{\o}lner criterion (TF) (exhaustion principle with controlled increment), which forces bounded ratio in general. We verify (TF) in two families: finite-lamp wreath products over (TF) bases and lamplighters over amenable bases. For semidirect products $\mathbb Z^d\rtimes_A\mathbb Z$ we construct layer-nested sets of logarithmic height that are $A$-covariantly nested, F{\o}lner, and satisfy (TF)(ii) with a constant independent of $A\in\mathrm{GL}(d,\mathbb Z)$; and when $A$ is hyperbolic (no eigenvalue on the unit circle) we have full (TF). We also formulate ``gap conjectures'' that would settle the question for all amenable Cayley graphs.
  The BV viewpoint has spectral and analytic consequences: we derive constant-tracked Cheeger-type, Faber-Krahn, Nash inequalities, etc. The (TF) control further yields a tempered Property A, leading to explicit coarse embeddings into Hilbert space with compression $\rho(t) \gtrsim t^{1/2}/\log t$. Finally, we show that (TF) is a robust reflection of bi-equivariant geometry, and in virtually nilpotent classes this \emph{doubles} the sharp Wulff constant asymptotically-refining and answering another question of Gromov.</description>

      <title>Metrics for Parametric Families of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for analyzing data modeled as parameterized families of networks. Building on a Gromov-Wasserstein variant of optimal transport, we define a family of parameterized Gromov-Wasserstein distances for comparing such parametric data, including time-varying metric spaces induced by collective motion, temporally evolving weighted social networks, and random graph models. We establish foundational properties of these distances, showing that they subsume several existing metrics in the literature, and derive theoretical approximation guarantees. In particular, we develop computationally tractable lower bounds and relate them to graph statistics commonly used in random graph theory. Furthermore, we prove that our distances can be consistently approximated in random graph and random metric space settings via empirical estimates from generative models. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture in normed planes and an alpha-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Honeycomb Conjecture states that among tilings with unit area cells in the Euclidean plane, the average perimeter of a cell is minimal for a regular hexagonal tiling. This conjecture was proved by L. Fejes T\'oth for convex tilings, and by Hales for not necessarily convex tilings. In this paper we investigate the same question for tilings of a given normed plane, and show that among normal, convex tilings in a normed plane, the average squared perimeter of a cell is minimal for a tiling whose cells are translates of a centrally symmetric hexagon. We also show that the question whether the same statement is true for the average perimeter of a cell is closely related to an $\alpha$-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker on the area of polygons circumscribed about a convex disk. Exploring this connection we find families of norms in which the average perimeter of a cell of a tiling is minimal for a hexagonal tiling, and prove some additonal related results. Finally, we apply our method to give a partial answer to a problem of Steinhaus about the isoperimetric ratios of cells of certain tilings in the Euclidean plane, appeared in an open problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy.</description>

      <title>Tight colorful no-dimensional Tverberg theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study colorful no-dimensional Tverberg-type problems and obtain several optimal results. A colorful no-dimensional Tverberg-type theorem provides a bound on a radius $R$ such that, for any pairwise disjoint $k$-element subsets $Q_1,\dots,Q_n$ of a normed space, there exists a partition of $Q_1\cup\cdots\cup Q_n$ into disjoint transversals $\{P_1,\dots,P_k\}$ for which a ball of radius $R$ intersects the convex hull of each $P_i$ ($1\le i\le k$). Our methods are deterministic and dimension-free, and they are unified by optimizing two functionals: a quadratic \emph{selection} functional whose local maximizers produce a complete system of disjoint transversals, and a convex \emph{intersection} functional that certifies a common point.
  First, in the Euclidean setting we bound $R$ in terms of the Chebyshev radii (minimal enclosing-ball radii) of the color classes $Q_1,\dots,Q_n$. A key observation is a ``combinatorial'' subadditivity of the squared Chebyshev radius: given sequences $X=(x_1,\dots,x_k)$ and $Y=(y_1,\dots,y_k)$ of points in a Euclidean space, contained in balls of radii $R_X$ and $R_Y$ (not necessarily with the same center), one can reenumerate $Y$ so that the pointwise-sum sequence $Z=(x_1+y_1,\dots,x_k+y_k)$ is contained in a ball of radius $R_Z$ satisfying \[ R_Z^2 \le R_X^2 + R_Y^2 . \] As a corollary, we obtain the best-possible bound \[ R \le \frac{1}{\sqrt{2n}}\sqrt{\frac{k-1}{k}}\, \max_{1\le i\le n} \operatorname{diam}(Q_i). \] Our algorithm returns the desired disjoint transversals
  in overall time $\mathcal{O}(nk^3)$.
  Second, we develop a complementary approach based on the inter-color diameter and extend the framework to obtain no-dimensional colorful Tverberg-type results in the hyperbolic setting and in Banach spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11380v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study flips in hypertriangulations of planar points sets. Here a level-$k$ hypertriangulation of $n$ points in the planes is a subdivision induced by the projection of a $k$-hypersimplex, which is the convex hull of the barycenters of the $(k-1)$-dimensional faces of the standard $(n-1)$-simplex. In particular, we introduce four types of flips and prove that the level-2 hypertriangulations are connected by these flips.</description>

      <title>Precompactness of domains with lower Ricci curvature bound under Gromov-Hausdorff topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a quantitative version of the classical Hopf-Rinow theorem in terms of the doubling property, we prove new precompactness principles in the (pointed) Gromov-Hausdorff topology for domains in (maybe incomplete) Riemannian manifolds with a lower Ricci curvature bound, which are applicable to those with weak regularities considered in PDE theory, and the covering spaces of balls naturally appear in the study of local geometry and topology of manifolds with lower curvature bounds. All the new principles are more general than those earlier known for manifolds with smooth boundary, and improves those for manifolds with non-smooth boundary.</description>
