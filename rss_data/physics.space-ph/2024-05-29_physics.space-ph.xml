      <title>TeV Solar Gamma Rays as a probe for the Solar Internetwork Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic fields that emerge from beneath the solar surface and permeate the solar atmosphere are the key drivers of space weather and, thus, understanding them is important to human society. Direct observations, used to measure magnetic fields, can only probe the magnetic fields in the photosphere and above, far from the regions the magnetic fields are being enhanced by the solar dynamo. Solar gamma rays produced by cosmic rays interacting with the solar atmosphere have been detected from GeV to TeV energy range, and revealed that they are significantly affected by solar magnetic fields. However, much of the observations are yet to be explained by a physical model. Using a semi-analytic model, we show that magnetic fields at and below the photosphere with a large horizontal component could explain the $\sim$1 TeV solar gamma rays observed by HAWC. This could allow high-energy solar gamma rays to be a novel probe for magnetic fields below the photosphere.</description>

      <title>Multi spacecraft study with the Icarus model: Modelling the propagation of CMEs to Mercury and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of the disturbances in interplanetary space. Understanding the CME interior magnetic structure is crucial for advancing space weather studies. Assessing the capabilities of a numerical heliospheric model is crucial, as understanding the nature and extent of its limitations can be used for improving the model and the space weather predictions based on it.
  The present paper aims to test the capabilities of the recently developed heliospheric model Icarus and the linear force-free spheromak model that has been implemented in it.
  To validate the Icarus space weather modeling tool, two CME events were selected that were observed by two spacecraft located near Mercury and Earth, respectively. This enables testing the heliospheric model computed with Icarus at two distant locations. The source regions for the CMEs were identified, and the CME parameters were determined and later optimized. Different adaptive mesh refinement levels were applied in the simulations to assess its performance by comparing the simulation results to in-situ measurements.
  The first CME event erupted on SOL2013-07-09T15:24. The modeled time series were in good agreement with the observations both at MESSENGER and ACE. The second CME event started on SOL2014-02-16T10:24 and was more complicated, as three CME interactions occurred in this event. It was impossible to recover the observed profiles without modeling the other two CMEs that were observed, one before the main CME and one afterward. For both CME studies, AMR level 3 was sufficient to reconstruct small-scale features near Mercury, while at Earth, AMR level 4 was necessary due to the radially stretched grid that was used.</description>
