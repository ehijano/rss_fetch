      <title>Evidence of Nonlinear Signatures in Solar Wind Proton Density at the L1 Lagrange point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind is a medium characterized by strong turbulence and significant field fluctuations on various scales. Recent observations have revealed that magnetic turbulence exhibits a self-similar behavior. Similarly, high-resolution measurements of the proton density have shown comparable characteristics, prompting several studies into the multifractal properties of these density fluctuations. In this work, we show that low-resolution observations of the solar wind proton density over time, recorded by various spacecraft at Lagrange point L1, also exhibit non-linear and multifractal structures. The novelty of our study lies in the fact that this is the first systematic analysis of solar wind proton density using low-resolution (hourly) data collected by multiple spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point over a span of 17 years. Furthermore, we interpret our results within the framework of non-extensive statistical mechanics, which appears to be consistent with the observed nonlinear behavior. Based on the data, we successfully validate the q-triplet predicted by non-extensive statistical theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the most rigorous and systematic validation to date of the q-triplet in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Entropy between the Magnetic Field and Solar Energetic Particles during an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of solar wind bulk plasma have been routinely measured and quantified, unlike those of solar energetic particles (SEPs), whose thermodynamic properties have remained elusive until recently. The thermodynamic kappa (\(\kappa_{\rm EP}\)) that parameterizes the statistical distribution of SEP kinetic energy contains information regarding the population's level of correlation and effective degrees of freedom (\({\rm d_{eff}}\)). At the same time, the intermittent kappa (\(\kappa_{\Delta B}\)) that parameterizes the statistical distribution of magnetic field increments contains information about the correlation and \({\rm d_{eff}}\) involved in magnetic field fluctuations. Correlations between particles can be affected by magnetic field fluctuations, leading to a relationship between \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\). In this paper, we examine the relationship of \({\rm d_{eff}}\) and entropy between energetic particles and the magnetic field via the spatial variation of their corresponding parameter kappa values. We compare directly the values of \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\) using Parker Solar Probe IS\(\odot\)IS and FIELDS measurements during an SEP event associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). Remarkably, we find that \(\kappa_{\rm EP}\) and \(\kappa_{\Delta B}\) are anti-correlated via a linear relationship throughout the passing of the ICME, indicating a proportional exchange of \({\rm d_{eff}}\) from the magnetic field to energetic particles, i.e., \(\kappa_{\Delta B} \sim (-0.15 \pm 0.03)\kappa_{\rm EP}\), interpreted as an effective coupling ratio. This finding is crucial for improving our understanding of ICMEs and suggests that they help to produce an environment that enables the transfer of entropy from the magnetic field to energetic particles due to changes in intermittency of the magnetic field.</description>
