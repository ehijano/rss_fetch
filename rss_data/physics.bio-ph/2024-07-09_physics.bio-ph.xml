      <title>A differentiable Gillespie algorithm for simulating chemical kinetics, parameter estimation, and designing synthetic biological circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gillespie algorithm is commonly used to simulate and analyze complex chemical reaction networks. Here, we leverage recent breakthroughs in deep learning to develop a fully differentiable variant of the Gillespie algorithm. The differentiable Gillespie algorithm (DGA) approximates discontinuous operations in the exact Gillespie algorithm using smooth functions, allowing for the calculation of gradients using backpropagation. The DGA can be used to quickly and accurately learn kinetic parameters using gradient descent and design biochemical networks with desired properties. As an illustration, we apply the DGA to study stochastic models of gene promoters. We show that the DGA can be used to: (i) successfully learn kinetic parameters from experimental measurements of mRNA expression levels from two distinct $\textit{E. coli}$ promoters and (ii) design nonequilibrium promoter architectures with desired input-output relationships. These examples illustrate the utility of the DGA for analyzing stochastic chemical kinetics, including a wide variety of problems of interest to synthetic and systems biology.</description>

      <title>Bridging-Induced Phase Separation and Loop Extrusion Drive Noise in Chromatin Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcriptional noise, or heterogeneity, is important in cellular development and in disease. The molecular mechanisms driving it are, however, elusive and ill-understood. Here, we use computer simulations to explore the role of 3D chromatin structure in driving transcriptional noise. We study a simple polymer model where proteins - modeling complexes of transcription factors and polymerases - bind multivalently to transcription units - modeling regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. We also include cohesin-like factors which extrude chromatin loops that are important for the physiological folding of chromosomes. We find that transcription factor binding creates spatiotemporal patterning and a highly variable correlation time in transcriptional dynamics, providing a mechanism for intrinsic noise within a single cell. Instead, loop extrusion contributes to extrinsic noise, as the stochastic nature of this process leads to different networks of cohesin loops in different cells in our simulations. Our results could be tested with single-cell experiments and provide a pathway to understanding the principles underlying transcriptional plasticity in vivo.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Quantized Acoustic Phonons Map the Dynamics of a Single Virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural vibrational frequencies of biological particles such as viruses and bacteria encode critical information about their mechanical and biological states as they interact with their local environment and undergo structural evolution. However, detecting and tracking these vibrations within a biological context at the single particle level has remained elusive. In this study, we track the vibrational motions of single, unlabeled virus particles under ambient conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy. The ultrasonic spectrum of an 80-100 nm lentiviral pseudovirus reveals vibrational modes in the 19-22 GHz range sensitive to virus morphology and 2-10 GHz modes with nanosecond dephasing times reflecting viral envelope protein interactions. By tracking virus trajectories over minutes, we observe acoustic mode coupling mediated by the local environment. Single particle tracking allows capture of viral disassembly through correlated mode softening and dephasing. The sensitivity, high resolution, and speed of this approach promise deeper insights into biological dynamics and early-stage diagnostics at the single microorganism level.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model for RNA polymerase during the elongation stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Markovian model for the kinetics of RNA Polymerase (RNAP) which provides a physical explanation for the phenomenon of cooperative pushing during transcription elongation observed in biochemical experiments on Escherichia coli and yeast RNAP. To study how backtracking of RNAP affects cooperative pushing we incorporate into this model backward (upstream) RNAP moves. With a rigorous mathematical treatment of the model we derive conditions on the mutual static and kinetic interactions between RNAP under which backtracking preserves cooperative pushing. This is achieved by exact computation of several key properties in the steady state of this model, including the distribution of headway between two RNAP along the DNA template and the average RNAP velocity and flux.</description>

      <title>Theory of epigenetic switching due to stochastic histone mark loss during DNA replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much information does a cell inherit from its ancestors beyond its genetic sequence? What are the epigenetic mechanisms that allow this? Despite the rise in available epigenetic data, how such information is inherited through the cell cycle is still not fully understood. Here, we develop and analyse a simple mathematical model for histone-based epigenetic information that describes how daughter cells can recapitulate the gene expression profiles of their parent. We consider the dynamics of histone modifications during the cell cycle deterministically but also incorporate the largest stochastic element: DNA replication, where histones are randomly distributed between the two daughter DNA strands. This hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach enables an analytic derivation of the switching rate, i.e., the frequency of loss-of-memory events due to replication. While retaining great simplicity, the model can recapitulate experimental switching rate data, establishing its biological importance as a framework to quantitatively study epigenetic inheritance.</description>

      <title>Sequence disorder-induced first order phase transition in confined polyelectrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a statistical mechanical model of a generic flexible polyelectrolyte, comprised of identically charged monomers with long range electrostatic interactions, and short-range interactions quantified by a disorder field along the polymer contour sequence, which is randomly quenched. The free energy and the monomer density profile of the system for no electrolyte screening are calculated in the case of a system composed of two infinite plates with an intervening oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chain. We show that the effect of the contour sequence disorder mediated by short-range interactions leads to an enhanced localization of the polyelectrolyte chain and a first order phase transition at a critical value of the inter-surface spacing. This phase transition results in an abrupt change of the pressure from negative to positive values, effectively eliminating polyelectrolyte mediated bridging attraction.</description>

      <title>Novel second-order model for tumor evolution: description of cytostatic and cytotoxic effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer is a disease that takes millions of lives every year. Then, to propose treatments, avoid recurrence, and improve the patient's life quality, we need to analyze this disease from a biophysical perspective with a solid mathematical formulation. In this paper we introduce a novel deterministic model for the evolution of tumors under several conditions (untreated tumors and treated tumors using chemotherapy). Our model is characterized by a second-order differential equation, whose origin and interpretation are presented by exploiting our understanding of fluid mechanics (via continuity equations) and the theory of differential equations. Additionally, we show that our model can fit various experimental data sets. Thus, we prove that our nuanced and general model can describe accelerated growth, as well as cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. All in all, our model opens up a new window in the understanding of tumor evolution and represents a promising connection between the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of cancer.</description>

      <title>Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulation on DNA Double Strand Breaks Induced by Hydrogen Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scar model to reproduce how double-strand breaks occur in the telomeric DNA damaged by the effect of the $\beta$-decay of tritium to helium. In this scar model, the two hydrogens bonded to the 5$^\prime$ carbon connecting the pent saccharides and phosphate are removed. Molecular dynamics simulations using the reactive force field are carried out for 10 cases for the telomeric DNA consisting of 16 base pairs (32 nucleotides). It results in double-strand breaks (DSBs) being observed for structures with more than 24 scars. For 16 scar cases, only single-strand breaks (SSB) are observed. Moreover, in the case of $\left\{16, 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0, 16 \right\},$ where only one of the strands had scars, SSB occurs only in the scarred strand. Secondly, in the $\left\{16, 8 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 8, 16 \right\}$ cases, DSBs occurs. Therefore, we conclude that the following conditions are necessary for DSBs:(i) Scars must occur on both the L and R strands. (ii) A large number of scars (24 or more) must occur in close proximity to each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multicellular self-assembly into functional structures is a dynamic process that is critical in the development and diseases, including embryo development, organ formation, tumor invasion, and others. Being able to infer collective cell migratory dynamics from their static configuration is valuable for both understanding and predicting these complex processes. However, the identification of structural features that can indicate multicellular motion has been difficult, and existing metrics largely rely on physical instincts. Here we show that using a graph neural network (GNN), the motion of multicellular collectives can be inferred from a static snapshot of cell positions, in both experimental and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Multiple Modes of Motion for the Effectiveness of Outer Hair Cells at High Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for the sensitivity and frequency specificity of the mammalian ear. To perform this function, OHCs need to amplify the motion of the basilar membrane (BM), which is much stiffer than themselves. If OHCs and the BM are components of a single oscillator, this impedance mismatch seriously limits the effectiveness of OHCs. However, the elaborated structure of the organ of Corti can support multiple modes motion. Here, systems of two coupled oscillators are examined as the simplest models of the system with multiple modes of motion. It is found that some of these model systems have conditions, under which an OHC can function as an effective amplifier, overcoming the impedance mismatch. The present examination suggests that the presence of multiple modes of motion is a key to the exquisite performance of the mammalian ear.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gated First-Passage Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gated first-passage processes, where completion depends on both hitting a target and satisfying additional constraints, are prevalent across various fields. Despite their significance, analytical solutions to basic problems remain unknown, e.g. the detection time of a diffusing particle by a gated interval, disk, or sphere. In this paper, we elucidate the challenges posed by continuous gated first-passage processes and present a renewal framework to overcome them. This framework offers a unified approach for a wide range of problems, including those with single-point, half-line, and interval targets. The latter have so far evaded exact solutions. Our analysis reveals that solutions to gated problems can be obtained directly from the ungated dynamics. This, in turn, reveals universal properties and asymptotic behaviors, shedding light on cryptic intermediate-time regimes and refining the notion of high-crypticity for continuous-space gated processes. Moreover, we extend our formalism to higher dimensions, showcasing its versatility and applicability. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of continuous gated first-passage processes and offers analytical tools for studying them across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Rebuilding the Habitable Zone from the Bottom Up with Computational Zones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computation, if treated as a set of physical processes that act on information represented by states of matter, encompasses biological systems, digital systems, and other constructs, and may be a fundamental measure of living systems. The opportunity for biological computation, represented in the propagation and selection-driven evolution of information-carrying organic molecular structures, has been partially characterized in terms of planetary habitable zones based on primary conditions such as temperature and the presence of liquid water. A generalization of this concept to computational zones is proposed, with constraints set by three principal characteristics: capacity (including computation rates), energy, and instantiation (or substrate, including spatial extent). Computational zones naturally combine traditional habitability factors, including those associated with biological function that incorporate the chemical milieu, constraints on nutrients and free energy, as well as element availability. Two example applications are presented by examining the fundamental thermodynamic work efficiency and Landauer limit of photon-driven biological computation on planetary surfaces and of generalized computation in stellar energy capture structures (a.k.a. Dyson structures). It is suggested that computational zones involving nested structures or substellar objects could manifest unique observational signatures as cool far-infrared emitters. While these latter scenarios are entirely hypothetical, they offer a useful, complementary, introduction to the potential universality of computational zones.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic diffusion in apolar active suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active suspensions encompass a wide range of complex fluids containing microscale energy-injecting particles, such as cells, bacteria or artificially powered active colloids. Because they are intrinsically non-equilibrium, active suspensions can display a number of fascinating phenomena, including turbulent-like large-scale coherent motion and enhanced diffusion. Here, using a recently developed active Fast Stokesian Dynamics method, we present a detailed numerical study on the hydrodynamic diffusion in apolar active suspensions. Specifically, we simulate suspensions of active but non-self-propelling spherical squirmers, of either puller- or pusher-type, at volume fractions from 0.5% to 55%. Our results show little difference between pullers and pushers in their instantaneous and long-time dynamics, where the translational dynamics vary non-monotonically with the volume fraction, with a peak diffusivity at around 10% to 20%, in stark contrast to suspensions of self-propelling particles. On the other hand, the rotational dynamics tend to increase with the volume fraction as is the case for self-propelling particles. To explain these dynamics, we provide detailed scaling and statistical analyses based on the activity-induced hydrodynamic interactions and the observed microstructural correlations, which display a weak local order. Overall, these results elucidate and highlight the different effects of particle activity on the collective dynamics and transport phenomena in active fluids.</description>
