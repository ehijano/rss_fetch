      <title>Optimal wind farm energy and reserve scheduling incorporating wake interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for optimal energy and reserve scheduling of wind farms by explicitly modelling wake interactions to enhance market participation and operational efficiency. Conventional methods often neglect wake effects, relying on power curve estimations that represent an upper limit and reduce market performance. To address this, a two-stage stochastic programming framework is developed, integrating a wake-aware power estimation model within the FLORIS simulation software. Wind and reserve uncertainties are addressed through scenario generation and reduction, enabling wind power producers to optimise participation in day-ahead energy and ancillary services markets, with particular focus on the Frequency Restoration Reserve (FRR). The wake-aware model provides more realistic power output predictions based on site-specific wind and atmospheric conditions, improving scheduling accuracy and reducing imbalance penalties. Wake steering is further employed to mitigate wake-induced losses and increase income through participation in ancillary services. The proposed approach is evaluated through a case study of the London Array offshore wind farm participating in the Great Britain (GB) electricity markets. Results show that conventional methods estimate production 12-13% higher, leading to imbalance penalties and 3% lower revenue compared with the wake-aware approach accounting for wake interactions. Moreover, the steering-enhanced approach yields an additional 1-2% increase in income relative to the wake-aware baseline. These findings underscore the value of accounting for wake interactions in wind farm scheduling and demonstrate the economic and operational benefits of active wake management, offering insights for improving grid stability and profitability as wind penetration continues to rise.</description>

      <title>On the wake and flapping dynamics of different aspect ratio flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flapping of flags is a classical problem involving fast and large amplitude deformations of a thin flexible plate and unsteady flow phenomena. We perform systematic time and space-resolved measurements of the deformation and drag acting on flapping flags for various aspect ratios and mass ratios. Bending waves travel from the root to the tip at a speed close to the incoming flow and the typical wavelength of the waves scales with the length of the flag. With smaller aspect ratio, the local dynamic pressure exerted by the fluid on the flag is reduced, lowering the wave propagation speed, and reducing the tip frequency. The effect of aspect ratio on the vortex formation in the near wake is analysed using flow field measurements. We identified two characteristic length scales, the ratio of the flag area over its perimeter $L^*$ and the square root of area $\sqrt{HL}$ that scale the circulation shed during a cycle. Changes in aspect ratio and mass ratio generate a wide scattering of the mean drag coefficient, ranging from 0 to 0.55. We discuss a kinematic-based model for the mean drag coefficient. This model uses the mass ratio and the typical tip speed, which depends linearly on the wave speeds, to predict the mean drag coefficient without any fitting parameter.</description>

      <title>A Unified Wake Topology Map for He II Counterflow Past a Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal counterflow of superfluid $^4$He past a cylinder produces quasi-steady eddies not only downstream but also anomalously upstream. However, the mechanism and organizing principles behind the observed multistable wake topologies (0-, 2-, 4-, and 6-vortex states) have remained unclear. We show that the full spectrum of reported normal-fluid wake states is captured numerically with a two-fluid model coupled to Vinen's vortex-line-density equation. Our simulations further reveal that the superfluid component can also develop anomalous upstream eddies, a feature not previously reported. We trace these behaviors to a self-organized zone of enhanced mutual-friction dissipation near the cylinder shoulders that reshapes the effective obstacle, drives upstream eddies in both components, and suppresses intrinsic wake oscillations in the normal fluid. Guided by this mechanism, we perform systematic parameter scans and construct a unified phase diagram in terms of the normal-fluid Reynolds number $Re_n$ and a dimensionless interaction number $N$, separating inertia- and mutual-friction-controlled transitions and delineating the parameter windows for the discrete wake topologies. These results turn a striking phenomenology into a predictive map and establish mutual-friction feedback as a robust route to unusual wake structures in quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Comparison of inviscid and viscous vortex shedding from translating and rotating plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare an inviscid vortex sheet model with continuous leading-edge shedding with direct Navier-Stokes simulations over a wide range of unsteady plate motions at moderate Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \approx 1000$). Approximately $70$ distinct kinematic configurations are examined, spanning both body-dominated and flow-dominated regimes. In body-dominated motions, where the fluid dynamics are primarily driven by prescribed plate accelerations, the inviscid model accurately reproduces normal force histories and the qualitative structure of the induced vorticity field. In flow-dominated configurations, with quasi-periodic vortex shedding, agreement with force predictions is good but reduced at low angles of attack, reflecting the greater sensitivity of vortex shedding dynamics to physical and computational parameters. The ability of the present formulation to accommodate stable, continuous leading-edge vortex shedding enables uniform comparisons across diverse motions and clarifies the regimes in which inviscid vortex sheet models can be used reliably for force prediction and physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Validation of a high-order finite difference compressible solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The verification and validation of a high-order compressible in-house solver based on a compact finite difference scheme are presented. Validation is performed using five canonical cases: the one-dimensional Sod shock tube problem, two-dimensional shock-shear layer interaction, compressible channel flow, compressible turbulent boundary layer, and shock-turbulent boundary layer interaction. Comparisons against exact solutions and reference direct numerical simulation data demonstrate accurate shock capturing, resolution of vortical structures, and good agreement for first and second order statistics.</description>

      <title>On large-scale oceanic wind-drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier--Stokes equations in rotating spherical coordinates with constant density and eddy viscosity varying only with depth, and appropriate, physically motivated boundary conditions, we derive an asymptotic model for the description of non-equatorial wind-generated oceanic drift currents. We do not invoke any tangent-plane approximations, thus allowing for large-scale flows that would not be captured by the classical $f$-plane approach. The strategy is to identify two small intrinsic scales for the flow (namely, the ratio between the depth of the Ekman layer and the Earth's radius, and the Rossby number) and, after a careful scaling, perform a double asymptotic expansion with respect to these small parameters. This leads to a system of linear ordinary differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the leading-order dynamics, in addition to which we identify the governing equations for the first-order correction with respect to the Rossby number. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the leading-order equations and show that the solution behaves like a classical Ekman spiral for any eddy viscosity profile; moreover, we discuss the solution of the equations for the first-order correction, for which we also provide a priori bounds in terms of the leading-order solution. Finally, we discuss several cases of explicit eddy viscosity profiles (constant, linearly decreasing, linearly increasing, piecewise linear, and exponentially decaying) and compute the surface deflection angle of the wind-drift current. We obtain results that are remarkably consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Band-Ensemble Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with Frequency Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents band-ensemble Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (bSPOD). The approach is inspired by frequency smoothing, a method used to reduce estimator variance in power spectral density estimates, and is here extended to SPOD. The algorithm estimates SPOD modes from consecutive Fourier coefficients obtained from a single Fourier transform of the full time record and thus avoids time segmentation. In this study, bSPOD is applied to artificial test data and to a PIV data set of a broadband-tonal cavity flow. Compared to the more commonly used Welch-based SPOD formulation, bSPOD reduces spectral leakage, permits increased frequency resolution, and retains frequency information of tonal components at comparable computational cost. These features enable reduced estimator variance while maintaining low bias for tonal components, making bSPOD particularly effective for broadband-tonal flows.</description>

      <title>Purified Two-Relaxation-Time Lattice Boltzmann Method: Removing Ghost Modes from TRT for Enhanced Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-relaxation-time (TRT) lattice Boltzmann model is widely adopted for its simplicity and tunable boundary accuracy. However, its collision operator relaxes the full symmetric non-equilibrium component, implicitly retaining non-hydrodynamic ghost modes that degrade stability at high Reynolds numbers. In this work, we establish a rigorous connection between ghost-mode filtering and regularization within the TRT framework. By decomposing the discrete velocity space into hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic subspaces, we prove that the TRT-regularized lattice Boltzmann (TRT-RLB) model is mathematically equivalent to the standard TRT model with ghost modes explicitly removed. This equivalence holds exactly for D2Q9 and D3Q19 lattices, where the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces are completely spanned by the physically relevant Hermite modes and identifiable ghost modes. Based on this finding, we propose the Purified TRT (P-TRT) model, which achieves regularization-level stability through simple algebraic ghost-mode subtraction rather than expensive tensor projections. For D2Q9, the non-equilibrium collision cost is reduced from 180 to 52 floating-point operations per node, a 71% reduction. Linear stability analysis in moment space further reveals that the P-TRT operator annihilates the ghost eigenvalue, proving its spectral radius is bounded above by that of standard TRT and that stability is governed exclusively by hydrodynamic modes. Benchmarks including the double shear layer at Re up to 10^7, Taylor--Green vortex decay, force-driven Poiseuille flow, and creeping flow past a square cylinder confirm that P-TRT preserves the stability, second-order accuracy, and zero-slip boundary properties of TRT-RLB while retaining the simplicity of the TRT family.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoresis of a non-polar fluid droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusiophoresis of a non-polarizable droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactant, for which the surface charge arises from adsorption of surfactant at the fluid-fluid interface. Unlike previous studies that assume either a fixed surface charge or instantaneous equilibrium between the interface and the adjacent electrolyte, we formulate the interfacial transport based on the mass-balance framework incorporating Langmuir adsorption-desorption kinetics and finite surface diffusivity. The coupled electrokinetic problem is solved using a perturbation approach. Analytical expressions for the droplet mobility and interfacial velocity are derived for insoluble surfactants. We demonstrate that assuming uniform, immobile surface charge leads to unphysical predictions, including negative chemiphoresis and singular mobility, whereas allowing the surface charge to evolve through interfacial surfactant redistribution yields continuous and physically consistent droplet diffusiophoresis. Interfacial kinetic exchange is found to play a central role. Increasing the desorption rate enhances surfactant redistribution and Marangoni stress, weakens the negative mobility, reverses the direction of motion through competition between electrophoretic and chemiphoretic contributions, and subsequently leads to a strong enhancement of positive mobility before eventual saturation in the transport-limited regime. The dependence of mobility on viscosity ratio and electrolyte composition of different salts further reveals how mixed electrolytes provides a robust means of tuning droplet motion. This study highlights the critical role of finite-rate surfactant dynamics and interfacial transport in determining the diffusiophoresis of fluid particles, with implications for manipulating droplets in microfluidic and varying-salinity environments.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Binary-fluid Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>

      <title>Interfacial dynamics induced by impacts across rigid and soft substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate impact-induced gas-liquid interfacial dynamics through experiments in which a liquid-filled container impacts substrates with elastic moduli from $O(10^{-1})$ MPa to $O(10^{5})$ MPa. Upon impact, the concave gas-liquid interface inside the container deforms and emits a focused jet. When the jet velocity is normalized by the container impact velocity, all data collapse onto a single curve when plotted against the Cauchy number, $Ca = \rho_{\rm e} V_{\rm i}^2 / E$, which represents the ratio of the inertial force of the container-liquid system to the elastic restoring force of the substrate. The dimensionless jet velocity remains nearly constant for $Ca&lt; 10^{-4}$, but decreases significantly for $Ca &gt; 10^{-4}$. Based on this observation, we define the boundary between the rigid-impact and soft-impact regimes using the Cauchy number, providing a quantitative criterion for what constitutes ``softness'' in impact-driven interfacial flows. To explain the reduction in jet velocity observed in the soft-impact regime, we introduce a framework in which only the impulse transferred within the effective time window for jet formation contributes to interface acceleration. This concept, referred to as the partial impulse, captures the situation where the impact interval (the duration of contact between the container and the substrate) exceeds the focusing interval (the time required for jet formation). By modelling the contact force using an elastic foundation model and solving the resulting momentum equation over the finite impulse window, we quantitatively reproduce the experimental results. This partial impulse framework unifies the dynamics of impact-driven jetting across both rigid and soft substrate regimes, extending the applicability of classical impulse-based models.</description>

      <title>High Resolution and High-Speed Live Optical Flow Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) typically relies on cross-correlation,which makes it difficult to obtain instantaneous velocity fields that are both spatially dense and available in real time at high acquisition rates. Optical Flow Velocimetry (OFV) offers a per-pixel alternative. Here we demonstrate real-tome OFV that delivers dense velocity fields (one vector per pixel) with high effective spatial resolution at frequencies up to the kHz range. Using synthetic particle images for two benchmarks -- a Rankine vortex and a homogeneous isotropic turbulence DNS -- we show that, with suitable particle seeding, OFV can resolve strong displacement gradients down to small scales. We then achieve real-time performance through algorithmic refinements and GPU-focused optimizations, combined with practical choices of OFV parameters. With this implementation, 32 Mp fields are processed live at 90 Hz, 4 Mp fields up to 460 Hz, and 1 Mp fields up to 1400 Hz. The method is further validated experimentally on the flow past a circular cylinder, where dense instantaneous velocity fields support real-time computation of derived quantities over long durations. These capabilities enable in-experiment monitoring, recovery of low-frequency dynamics from sustained high-rate acquisition, and closed-loop-flow-control strategies based on OFV measurements while also accelerating conventional post-processing to reduce turnaround time and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and the enstrophy cascade in Ekman-Navier-Stokes two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional turbulence with linear (Ekman) friction exhibits spectral properties that deviate from the classical Kraichnan prediction for the direct enstrophy cascade. In particular, for sufficiently small viscosity and large friction, the enstrophy flux is suppressed in the cascade and, as a consequence, the small-scale vorticity field becomes passively transported by the large-scale, chaotic flow. We numerically address this problem by investigating how the statistics of the Lagrangian Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent in 2D Ekman-Navier-Stokes simulations are affected by the friction coefficient and by the other parameters of the flow. We derive a simple phenomenological model that interpolates the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent on the flow statistics from the large friction limit, where analytical predictions are available, to the small friction region. We find that the distribution of the FTLE around this mean value is always close to a Gaussian, and this allows to make a simple prediction for the correction of the spectral slope of the direct cascade which is in very good agreement with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Passive scalar cascade in the intermediate layer of turbulent channel flow for $Pr\leq 1$</title>

Abstract: Similarities and differences between Kolmogorov scale-by-scale equilibria/non-equilibria for velocity and scalar fields are investigated in the intermediate layer of a fully developed turbulent channel flow with a passive scalar/temperature field driven by a uniform heat source. The analysis is based on intermediate asymptotics and direct numerical simulations at different Prandtl numbers lower than unity. Similarly to what happens to the velocity fluctuations, for the fluctuating scalar field Kolmogorov scale-by-scale equilibrium is achieved asymptotically around a length scale $r_{min}$, which is located below the inertial range. The lengthscale $r_{min}$ and the ratio between the inter-scale transfer and dissipation rates at $r_{min}$ vary following power laws of the Prandtl number, with exponents determined by matched asymptotics based on the hypothesis of homogeneous two-point physics in non-homogeneous turbulence. The interscale transfer rates of turbulent kinetic energy and passive scalar variance are globally similar but show evident differences when their aligned/anti-aligned contributions are considered.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity graph-based neural networks architectures to learn Navier-Stokes solutions on non-parametrized 2D domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a graph-based, multi-fidelity learning framework for the prediction of stationary Navier--Stokes solutions in non-parametrized two-dimensional geometries. The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding-processing-physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions</description>

      <title>On the stability of viscous Riemann ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear stability of Riemann ellipsoids in both the inviscid limit and in the presence of weak viscosity. In the inviscid regime, we derive a generalised Poincare equation governing small fluid oscillations and construct a family of polynomial solutions that extends the classical results of Cartan to flows with a uniform strain field. This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and allowing a systematic investigation of viscosity-driven instabilities. Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Ultimate large-$Rm$ regime of the solar dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For more than 40 years the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major focus of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale non-linear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo at large magnetic Reynolds numbers, $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm&gt;1$ and $Pm&lt;1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical set-ups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in non-asymptotic turbulent magnetohydrodynamic regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach the ultimate regime in such 'realistic' global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.</description>
