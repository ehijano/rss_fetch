      <title>Probing the refined performance of the Categorical-Boosting algorithm to the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass model with different Skyrme forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear mass can offer profound insights into many physical branches, e.g., nuclear physics and astrophysics, while the predicted accuracy by nuclear mass models is usually far from satisfactory until now, especially within the fully microscopic self-consistent mean-field theory. In this project, we present the predictive power for the binding energy within the the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) methods with six widely used Skyrme forces (SkM*, SkP, SLy4, SV-min, UNEDF0 and UNEDF1) and evaluate the refined performance of the machine learning based on a novel Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm to the Skyrme HFB mass models. The root-mean-square (rms) deviations between the bare HFB calculations with different Skyrme forces and the available experimental data range from the minimum, about 1.43 MeV, for the UNEDF0 parameter set to the maximum, about 7.03 MeV, for the SkM* paraterer set. For the CatBoost-refined HFB predictions, the predictive power can be significantly improved. All the prediction accurancies on the testing set can reach the level around 0.2 MeV and, meanwhile, the large model bias can be reduced. The model-repair coefficients for the adopted Skyrme parameter sets are uniformly more than 80\%. Moreover, for 21 newly measured nuclei outside AME2020, the predicted masses by the CatBoost-refined HFB models are also in good agreement with the experimental data, illustrating their good generalization abilities. Intrestingly, it is found that the optimal Skyrme parameter set that possesses the highest predictive power for the bare HFB mass calculations may be not the best candidate for the CatBoost-refined HFB model, indicating the different abilities of picking up the missing ``physics'' for different Skyrme forces by the CatBoost algorithm.</description>

      <title>Collective excited states at small amplitude in neutron elastic scattering at low-energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the contributions of isoscalar and isovector collective excitations in the neutron elastic scattering of $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb nuclei by using a microscopic optical potential (MOP) derived from nuclear structure models based on self-consistent mean-field approaches. Particular attention is given to the role of these collective modes in shaping the imaginary part of the MOP and the resulting angular distributions. Our analysis indicates that both isoscalar and isovector contributions are significant for all considered targets, especially for light and medium targets. Furthermore, the Coulomb interaction is found to play an important role in describing absorption mechanisms and reproducing the experimental angular distributions.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of double Gamow-Teller sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum rules are important bulk properties of transition strength functions for atomic nuclei. Unlike the Ikeda sum rule for single Gamow-Teller transition, double Gamow-Teller transition sum rules rely on the details of many-body wavefunctions. We approximate the shell model ground state with nucleon-pair condensates, by projection after variation, and compute double Gamow-Teller (DGT) transition sum rules from both $\beta+$ and $\beta-$ directions. By systematic investigation of DGT sum rules of even-even nuclei in the $1s0d$, $1p0f$ major shells, we quantitatively estimate the model-dependent fractions in the sum rules, and analyze the importance of double isospin-analogue state in the DGT strength function.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network Correlation Functions for Light Nuclei with Chiral Two- and Three-Body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding high-quality trial wave functions for quantum Monte Carlo calculations of light nuclei requires a strong intuition for modeling the interparticle correlations as well as large computational resources for exploring the space of variational parameters. Moreover, for systems with three-body interactions, the wave function should account for many-body effects beyond simple pairwise correlations. In this work, we design neural networks that efficiently incorporate these factors to generate expressive wave function Ansatzes for light nuclei using variational Monte Carlo. Our neural-network approach for A=3 nuclei can capture, already at the level of variational Monte Carlo, the overwhelming majority of the ground-state energy estimated by Green's Function Monte Carlo (GFMC). We can find a 91% improvement over standard variational Monte Carlo and achieve a ground state energy within 0.45% of the GFMC result for 3H using the softest chiral interaction with neural networks. The result indicates the potential of neural networks to construct effective trial wave functions for quantum Monte Carlo calculations.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treating baryons as quark + interacting-diquark bound states, a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) is used to deliver an extensive, coherent set of predictions for $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryon unpolarised and polarised distribution functions (DFs) -- valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea -- and compare them with those of a like-structured nucleon. $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryons are strangeness negative-one isospin partners within the SU$(3)$-flavour baryon octet. This makes such structural comparisons significant. The study reveals impacts of diquark correlations and SU$(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking on $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^0$ structure functions, some of which are significant. For instance, were it not for the presence of axialvector diquarks in the $\Sigma^0$ at the hadron scale, the $s$ quark could carry none of the $\Sigma^0$ spin. The discussion canvasses issues that include helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the sign and size of polarised gluon DFs; and the origin and decomposition of baryon spins. Interpreted judiciously, the SCI analysis delivers an insightful explanation of baryon structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Thermal Static Potential and Pseudo-Scalar Quarkonium Spectral Functions from 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonia, which are bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark, play a key role in probing the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The dynamics of quarkonia in the QGP are encoded in their finite-temperature spectral functions. In this work, we estimate the quarkonium spectral functions in the pseudo-scalar channel using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with a pion mass of $320\,\text{MeV}$, at temperatures of $220\,\text{MeV}\,(1.2\,T_{pc}),\,251\,\text{MeV}\,(1.4\,T_{pc})\,\text{and}\,293\,\text{MeV}\,(1.6\,T_{pc})$. Reconstructing the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator is a well-known ill-posed problem, requiring additional physics-motivated input. We address this by smoothly matching contributions from different frequency regions of the spectral function, using appropriate physics valid for each region. The spectral function around $\omega \sim 2\,M_q$ is obtained using a non-perturbative complex potential, while for $\omega \gg 2\,M_q$ it is modeled using results from vacuum perturbation theory. Since the pseudoscalar channel does not receive a transport contribution near $\omega \sim 0$, we find that the combination of these two regions already provides a good description of the relativistic lattice pseudoscalar correlator. We observe a substantial thermal width in the $\eta_c(1S)$ state, indicating that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) is nearing dissolution at the studied temperatures. In comparison, the $\eta_b$ ground state exhibits little change and remains well-defined.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of a (3+1)D hybrid approach with initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to apply statistical learning, specifically Bayesian inference, to the (3+1)D SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid model using initial conditions generated by the SMASH transport code itself, with the objective of constraining model parameters and gaining deeper insight on the temperature and baryochemical potential dependence of both the shear and the bulk viscosity. This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. A Bayesian framework is employed, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the parameter space. The analysis compares model predictions against experimental observables, including particle yields, momentum and flow coefficients both at midrapidity as well as in forward and backward direction. We find that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid framework, using hadronic initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at different beam energies, can reproduce a variety of experimental observables at midrapidity and forward/backward rapidities. Notably, the preferred posterior distribution suggests a near-vanishing specific shear viscosity in the high-temperature QGP phase, combined with moderate-to-large bulk viscosity around the phase transition region, although the constraints on baryochemical potential dependence are weak. Our findings reveal that a hadronic initial condition constrains the evolution more strictly at intermediate energies, making parameters such as the hydrodynamic onset time highly sensitive. Intriguingly, the extracted shear viscosity differs substantially from previous Bayesian analyses, motivating further systematic studies with higher-statistics data sets and refined modeling assumptions.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a 1+1D toy model of particle space-time evolution. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energies. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single charm-anticharm quark pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei and the quark-gluon plasma hadronisation paradox. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>

Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking effects in pion couplings to constituent quark currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudoscalar and axial neutral and charged pion-constituent quark coupling constants are investigated with nondegenerate quark masses in different kinematical points, off shell and on shell pions and constituent quarks. By considering a large quark mass expansion of a quark determinant in the presence of local pion field and of constituent quark background currents, gluonic effects are considered by means of an effective gluon propagator that dresses quark currents. For the neutral pion, mixing effects are introduced by means of the pion mixing to states $P_0$ and $P_8$, that give rise to the $\pi^0-\eta-\eta'$ meson mixing, and mixing of quark currents via corresponding mixing interactions. The relative behavior of charged and neutral pion coupling constants to quarks may be nearly the same - in the framework of the constituent quark model - as the pion-nucleon coupling constants if mixings are introduced. A very small pion coupling to strange quark current is also obtained. The dependence of the positive and negative pion-constituent quark coupling constant on the non-degeneracy of quark masses, for emission and absorption processes, is identified.</description>

      <title>Efficient Monte Carlo Event Generation for Neutrino-Nucleus Exclusive Cross Sections</title>

Abstract: Modern neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions need to incorporate sophisticated nuclear models to achieve greater predictive precision. However, the computational complexity of these advanced models often limits their practicality for experimental analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a new Monte Carlo method utilizing Normalizing Flows to generate surrogate cross sections that closely approximate those of the original model while significantly reducing computational overhead. As a case study, we built a Monte Carlo event generator for the neutrino-nucleus cross section model developed by the Ghent group. This model employs a Hartree-Fock procedure to establish a quantum mechanical framework in which both the bound and scattering nucleon states are solutions to the mean-field nuclear potential. The surrogate cross sections generated by our method demonstrate excellent accuracy with a relative effective sample size of more than $98.4 \%$, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for differential cross sections.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of solar neutrinos confirmed that the inner workings of the Sun generally match our theoretical understanding of the fusion process. Solar neutrinos have also played a role in discovering that neutrinos have mass and that they oscillate. We combine the latest solar neutrino data along with other oscillation data from reactors to determine the Sun's density profile. We derive constraints given the current data and show the anticipated improvements with more reactor neutrino data from JUNO constraining the true oscillation parameters and more solar neutrino data from DUNE which should provide a crucial measurement of $hep$ neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</description>
