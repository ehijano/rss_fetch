      <title>Modulation of supernarrow EIT pair via atomic coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) using two identical beams in rubidium atomic vapor. The {\Lambda}-type EIT configuration is employed to examine the EIT spectrum for the D1 line in 87Rb F=2 characteristics16 by varying parameters such as frequency detuning, Iprobe/Ipump, the total power of probe and pump beam. Notably, the pump beam is also investigated in this process, which has not been previously studied. We study the effect of of the phase between the two applied fields and find that EIA and EIT can transform into each other by adjusting the relative phase. These finding may have applications in light drag or storage, optical switching, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Determination of Quantum Defects and Core Polarizability of Atomic Cesium via Terahertz and Radio-Frequency Spectroscopy in Thermal Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new measurements of quantum defects and core polarizabilities in cesium ($^{133}$Cs), based on transition frequency measurements between Rydberg states ($14 \leq n \leq 38$) obtained through terahertz (THz) and radio-frequency spectroscopy in a thermal atomic vapor. %By detuning resonant fields coupling neighbouring Rydberg states, we observe a detuning-dependent asymmetry in the line shape which can be used to extract the frequency of the transition. We perform a global fitting of our measurements to extract quantum defects of the $s_{1/2}$, $p_{1/2}$, $p_{3/2}$, $d_{3/2}$, $d_{5/2}$, $f_{5/2}$, $f_{7/2}$, $g_{7/2}$ and $g_{9/2}$ electronic states. Transitions between high angular momentum states ($4 \leq \ell \leq 8$) were measured to extract the Cs$^{+}$ dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities. We find $\alpha_{d} = 15.729(18)$ $a_{0}^{3}$ and $\alpha_{q} = 76.3(1.9)$ $a_{0}^{5}$ respectively. Using these results, and accounting for the covariances between parameters in the global fit, the energies for $n\ell_{j}$ Rydberg states can be estimated to a precision of a few MHz or less.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Search by Atom Interferometry in the Einstein-Elevator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESIRE project aims to test chameleon field theories as potential candidates for dark energy. The chameleon field is a light scalar field that is subject to screening mechanisms in dense environments making them hardly detectable. The project is designed to overcome this challenge. To this end, a specially designed source mass generates periodic gravitational and chameleon potentials. The design of the source mass allows for adjustment of the amplitude and periodicity of the gravitational potential while keeping the chameleon potential unchanged. The periodicity of the potentials makes them distinguishable from the environment and allows for resonant detection using multiloop atom interferometry under microgravity conditions.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior in a many-body Rydberg atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that the Rydberg criticality in a many-body atomic system can enhance the measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field by increasing the Fisher information. In our previous work, we proposed and experimentally verified that the Fisher information near the critical point can be increased by more than two orders of magnitude with the Rydberg atoms coupled with an optical cavity compared with that in free space. Here we demonstrate the precision measurement of the microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior. We show that the equivalent measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field can be enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with that in free space. The obtained sensitivity can be enhanced to 2.6 nV/cm/Hz$^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Atom Loss Errors in Fault Tolerant Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Errors associated with qubit loss constitute an important source of noise in many quantum hardware systems, particularly in neutral atom quantum computers. We develop a theoretical framework to handle these errors in logical algorithms, incorporating decoding techniques and circuit-level optimizations. Focusing on experimentally-motivated error models, we introduce a delayed-erasure decoder which leverages information from state-selective readout to accurately correct loss errors, even when their precise locations are unknown. Our decoding technique is compatible with a wide range of quantum error correction codes and general logical circuits. Using this decoder, we identify strategies for detecting and correcting atom loss based on the logical circuit structure. For deep circuits with a large number of gate layers prior to logical measurements, we explore methods to integrate loss detection into syndrome extraction with minimal overhead, identifying optimal strategies depending on the qubit loss fraction in the noise. In contrast, many algorithmic subroutines involve frequent gate teleportation, shortening the circuit depth before logical measurement and naturally replacing qubits without additional overhead. We simulate such a teleportation-based algorithm, involving a toy model for small-angle synthesis and find a significant improvement in logical error rates as the loss fraction increases, with loss handled solely through teleportation. These results provide a path forward for advancing large-scale fault tolerant quantum computation in systems with loss errors.</description>

      <title>Quantum state discrimination in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system of a single trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate an unambiguous quantum state discrimination of two qubit states under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry in a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. We show that any two non-orthogonal states can become orthogonal subjected to time evolution of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian in both the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry preserving and broken regimes, thus can be discriminated deterministically. For a given pair of candidate states, we show that the parameters of the Hamiltonian must be confined in a proper range, within which there exists an optimal choice to realize quantum brachistochrone for the fastest orthogonalization. Besides, we provide a clear geometric picture and some analytic results to understand the main conclusions. Our work shows a promising application of non-Hermitian physics in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Enhanced Rydberg Atomic Superheterodyne Receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity measurements of the microwave electric field are important in applications of communication and metrology. \replaced{The sensitivity of traditional Rydberg superheterodyne receivers in free space is effectively determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is often considered equivalent to sensitivity in practical sensing applications.}{The sensitivity of the traditional Rydberg superheterodyne receivers in free space is limited by signal-to-noise contrast.} In this work, we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced receiver, where an optical cavity significantly amplifies the interaction between the probe light and cesium atoms, which substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio via enhancing the expansion coefficient \( \kappa \). \added{Here, $\kappa$ is the edge slope of the single peak obtained by fitting the double-peak EIT-AT spectrum, characterizing the response of the probe light to the frequency detuning of the coupling laser.}The sensitivity is thus boosted by a factor of approximately 19 dB. This study highlights the pivotal role of optical cavities in advancing Rydberg-based detection systems, offering a promising approach for high-sensitivity microwave electric field measurements.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the coherence time of a neutral atom by an optical quartic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherence time of an optically trapped neutral atom is a crucial parameter for quantum technologies. We found that optical dipole traps with higher-order spatial forms inherently offer lower decoherence rates compared to those with lower-order spatial forms. We formulated the decoherence rate caused by the variance of the differential energy shift and photon jumping rate. Then, we constructed blue-detuned harmonic and quartic optical dipole traps, and experimentally investigated the coherence time of a trapped single cesium atom. The experimental results qualitatively verified our theory. Our approach provides a novel method to enhance the coherence time of optically trapped neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>PT -symmetry breaking and universal spectral statistics in quantum kicked rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous parity-time (PT )-symmetry breaking and spectral properties of a PT symmetric quantum kicked rotor under resonance conditions. At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI{\dag} and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry.</description>
