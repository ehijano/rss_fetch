      <title>Visual Analysis of Multi-outcome Causal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a visual analysis method for multiple causal graphs with different outcome variables, namely, multi-outcome causal graphs. Multi-outcome causal graphs are important in healthcare for understanding multimorbidity and comorbidity. To support the visual analysis, we collaborated with medical experts to devise two comparative visualization techniques at different stages of the analysis process. First, a progressive visualization method is proposed for comparing multiple state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms. The method can handle mixed-type datasets comprising both continuous and categorical variables and assist in the creation of a fine-tuned causal graph of a single outcome. Second, a comparative graph layout technique and specialized visual encodings are devised for the quick comparison of multiple causal graphs. In our visual analysis approach, analysts start by building individual causal graphs for each outcome variable, and then, multi-outcome causal graphs are generated and visualized with our comparative technique for analyzing differences and commonalities of these causal graphs. Evaluation includes quantitative measurements on benchmark datasets, a case study with a medical expert, and expert user studies with real-world health research data.</description>

      <title>MGFs: Masked Gaussian Fields for Meshing Building based on Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, image-based building surface reconstruction has garnered substantial research interest and has been applied across various fields, such as heritage preservation, architectural planning, etc. Compared to the traditional photogrammetric and NeRF-based solutions, recently, Gaussian fields-based methods have exhibited significant potential in generating surface meshes due to their time-efficient training and detailed 3D information preservation. However, most gaussian fields-based methods are trained with all image pixels, encompassing building and nonbuilding areas, which results in a significant noise for building meshes and degeneration in time efficiency. This paper proposes a novel framework, Masked Gaussian Fields (MGFs), designed to generate accurate surface reconstruction for building in a time-efficient way. The framework first applies EfficientSAM and COLMAP to generate multi-level masks of building and the corresponding masked point clouds. Subsequently, the masked gaussian fields are trained by integrating two innovative losses: a multi-level perceptual masked loss focused on constructing building regions and a boundary loss aimed at enhancing the details of the boundaries between different masks. Finally, we improve the tetrahedral surface mesh extraction method based on the masked gaussian spheres. Comprehensive experiments on UAV images demonstrate that, compared to the traditional method and several NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SOTA solutions, our approach significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of building surface reconstruction. Notably, as a byproduct, there is an additional gain in the novel view synthesis of building.</description>

      <title>An Object is Worth 64x64 Pixels: Generating 3D Object via Image Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for generating realistic 3D models with UV maps through a representation termed "Object Images." This approach encapsulates surface geometry, appearance, and patch structures within a 64x64 pixel image, effectively converting complex 3D shapes into a more manageable 2D format. By doing so, we address the challenges of both geometric and semantic irregularity inherent in polygonal meshes. This method allows us to use image generation models, such as Diffusion Transformers, directly for 3D shape generation. Evaluated on the ABO dataset, our generated shapes with patch structures achieve point cloud FID comparable to recent 3D generative models, while naturally supporting PBR material generation.</description>

      <title>DaVE -- A Curated Database of Visualization Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualization, from simple line plots to complex high-dimensional visual analysis systems, has established itself throughout numerous domains to explore, analyze, and evaluate data. Applying such visualizations in the context of simulation science where High-Performance Computing (HPC) produces ever-growing amounts of data that is more complex, potentially multidimensional, and multimodal, takes up resources and a high level of technological experience often not available to domain experts. In this work, we present DaVE -- a curated database of visualization examples, which aims to provide state-of-the-art and advanced visualization methods that arise in the context of HPC applications. Based on domain- or data-specific descriptors entered by the user, DaVE provides a list of appropriate visualization techniques, each accompanied by descriptions, examples, references, and resources. Sample code, adaptable container templates, and recipes for easy integration in HPC applications can be downloaded for easy access to high-fidelity visualizations. While the database is currently filled with a limited number of entries based on a broad evaluation of needs and challenges of current HPC users, DaVE is designed to be easily extended by experts from both the visualization and HPC communities.</description>

      <title>ReSyncer: Rewiring Style-based Generator for Unified Audio-Visually Synced Facial Performer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lip-syncing videos with given audio is the foundation for various applications including the creation of virtual presenters or performers. While recent studies explore high-fidelity lip-sync with different techniques, their task-orientated models either require long-term videos for clip-specific training or retain visible artifacts. In this paper, we propose a unified and effective framework ReSyncer, that synchronizes generalized audio-visual facial information. The key design is revisiting and rewiring the Style-based generator to efficiently adopt 3D facial dynamics predicted by a principled style-injected Transformer. By simply re-configuring the information insertion mechanisms within the noise and style space, our framework fuses motion and appearance with unified training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSyncer not only produces high-fidelity lip-synced videos according to audio, but also supports multiple appealing properties that are suitable for creating virtual presenters and performers, including fast personalized fine-tuning, video-driven lip-syncing, the transfer of speaking styles, and even face swapping.

      <title>Online Photon Guiding with 3D Gaussians for Caustics Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In production rendering systems, caustics are typically rendered via photon mapping and gathering, a process often hindered by insufficient photon density. In this paper, we propose a novel photon guiding method to improve the photon density and overall quality for caustic rendering. The key insight of our approach is the application of a global 3D Gaussian mixture model, used in conjunction with an adaptive light sampler. This combination effectively guides photon emission in expansive 3D scenes with multiple light sources. By employing a global 3D Gaussian mixture, our method precisely models the distribution of the points of interest. To sample emission directions from the distribution at any observation point, we introduce a novel directional transform of the 3D Gaussian, which ensures accurate photon emission guiding. Furthermore, our method integrates a global light cluster tree, which models the contribution distribution of light sources to the image, facilitating effective light source selection. We conduct experiments demonstrating that our approach robustly outperforms existing photon guiding techniques across a variety of scenarios, significantly advancing the quality of caustic rendering.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Transfer Function Update for Distance Map based Volume Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct volume rendering using ray-casting is widely used in practice. By using GPUs and applying acceleration techniques as empty space skipping, high frame rates are possible on modern hardware. This enables performance-critical use-cases such as virtual reality volume rendering. The currently fastest known technique uses volumetric distance maps to skip empty sections of the volume during ray-casting but requires the distance map to be updated per transfer function change. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique for subdividing the volume intensity range into partitions and deriving what we call partitioned distance maps. These can be used to accelerate the distance map computation for a newly changed transfer function by a factor up to 30. This allows the currently fastest known empty space skipping approach to be used while maintaining high frame rates even when the transfer function is changed frequently.</description>

      <title>SimEndoGS: Efficient Data-driven Scene Simulation using Robotic Surgery Videos via Physics-embedded 3D Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical scene simulation plays a crucial role in surgical education and simulator-based robot learning. Traditional approaches for creating these environments with surgical scene involve a labor-intensive process where designers hand-craft tissues models with textures and geometries for soft body simulations. This manual approach is not only time-consuming but also limited in the scalability and realism. In contrast, data-driven simulation offers a compelling alternative. It has the potential to automatically reconstruct 3D surgical scenes from real-world surgical video data, followed by the application of soft body physics. This area, however, is relatively uncharted. In our research, we introduce 3D Gaussian as a learnable representation for surgical scene, which is learned from stereo endoscopic video. To prevent over-fitting and ensure the geometrical correctness of these scenes, we incorporate depth supervision and anisotropy regularization into the Gaussian learning process. Furthermore, we apply the Material Point Method, which is integrated with physical properties, to the 3D Gaussians to achieve realistic scene deformations. Our method was evaluated on our collected in-house and public surgical videos datasets. Results show that it can reconstruct and simulate surgical scenes from endoscopic videos efficiently-taking only a few minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene-and produce both visually and physically plausible deformations at a speed approaching real-time. The results demonstrate great potential of our proposed method to enhance the efficiency and variety of simulations available for surgical education and robot learning.</description>

      <title>Automatic Graph Topology-Aware Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing efforts are dedicated to designing many topologies and graph-aware strategies for the graph Transformer, which greatly improve the model's representation capabilities. However, manually determining the suitable Transformer architecture for a specific graph dataset or task requires extensive expert knowledge and laborious trials. This paper proposes an evolutionary graph Transformer architecture search framework (EGTAS) to automate the construction of strong graph Transformers. We build a comprehensive graph Transformer search space with the micro-level and macro-level designs. EGTAS evolves graph Transformer topologies at the macro level and graph-aware strategies at the micro level. Furthermore, a surrogate model based on generic architectural coding is proposed to directly predict the performance of graph Transformers, substantially reducing the evaluation cost of evolutionary search. We demonstrate the efficacy of EGTAS across a range of graph-level and node-level tasks, encompassing both small-scale and large-scale graph datasets. Experimental results and ablation studies show that EGTAS can construct high-performance architectures that rival state-of-the-art manual and automated baselines.</description>

      <title>"I Came Across a Junk": Understanding Design Flaws of Data Visualization from the Public's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The visualization community has a rich history of reflecting upon flaws of visualization design, and research in this direction has remained lively until now. However, three main gaps still exist. First, most existing work characterizes design flaws from the perspective of researchers rather than the perspective of general users. Second, little work has been done to infer why these design flaws occur. Third, due to problems such as unclear terminology and ambiguous research scope, a better framework that systematically outlines various design flaws and helps distinguish different types of flaws is desired. To address the above gaps, this work investigated visualization design flaws through the lens of the public, constructed a framework to summarize and categorize the identified flaws, and explored why these flaws occur.</description>

      <title>Regularized Multi-Decoder Ensemble for an Error-Aware Scene Representation Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature grid Scene Representation Networks (SRNs) have been applied to scientific data as compact functional surrogates for analysis and visualization. As SRNs are black-box lossy data representations, assessing the prediction quality is critical for scientific visualization applications to ensure that scientists can trust the information being visualized. Currently, existing architectures do not support inference time reconstruction quality assessment, as coordinate-level errors cannot be evaluated in the absence of ground truth data. We propose a parameter-efficient multi-decoder SRN (MDSRN) ensemble architecture consisting of a shared feature grid with multiple lightweight multi-layer perceptron decoders. MDSRN can generate a set of plausible predictions for a given input coordinate to compute the mean as the prediction of the multi-decoder ensemble and the variance as a confidence score. The coordinate-level variance can be rendered along with the data to inform the reconstruction quality, or be integrated into uncertainty-aware volume visualization algorithms. To prevent the misalignment between the quantified variance and the prediction quality, we propose a novel variance regularization loss for ensemble learning that promotes the Regularized multi-decoder SRN (RMDSRN) to obtain a more reliable variance that correlates closely to the true model error. We comprehensively evaluate the quality of variance quantification and data reconstruction of Monte Carlo Dropout, Mean Field Variational Inference, Deep Ensemble, and Predicting Variance compared to the proposed MDSRN and RMDSRN across diverse scalar field datasets. We demonstrate that RMDSRN attains the most accurate data reconstruction and competitive variance-error correlation among uncertain SRNs under the same neural network parameter budgets.</description>
