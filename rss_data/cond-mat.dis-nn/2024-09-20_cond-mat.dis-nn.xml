      <title>Generalised correlations in disordered dynamical systems: Insights from the many-species Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of disordered systems, one often chooses a matrix of independent identically distributed interaction coefficients to represent the quenched random couplings between components, perhaps with some symmetry constraint or correlations between diagonally opposite pairs of elements. However, a more general set of couplings, which still preserves the statistical interchangeability of the components, could involve correlations between interaction coefficients sharing only a single row or column index. These correlations have been shown to arise naturally in systems such as the generalised Lotka-Volterra equations (gLVEs). In this work, we perform a dynamic mean-field analysis to understand how single-index correlations affect the dynamics and stability of disordered systems, taking the gLVEs as our example. We show that in-row correlations raise the level of noise in the mean field process, even when the overall variance of the interaction coefficients is held constant. We also see that correlations between transpose pairs of rows and columns can either enhance or suppress feedback effects, depending on the sign of the correlation coefficient. In the context of the gLVEs, in-row and transpose row/column correlations thus affect both the species survival rate and the stability of ecological equilibria.</description>

      <title>On the topology of solutions to random continuous constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the set of solutions to $M$ random polynomial equations whose $N$ variables are restricted to the $(N-1)$-sphere. Each equation has independent Gaussian coefficients and a target value $V_0$. When solutions exist, they form a manifold. We compute the average Euler characteristic of this manifold in the limit of large $N$, and find different behavior depending on the target value $V_0$, the ratio $\alpha=M/N$, and the variances of the coefficients. We divide this behavior into five phases with different implications for the topology of the solution manifold. When $M=1$ there is a correspondence between this problem and level sets of the energy in the spherical spin glasses. We conjecture that the transition energy dividing two of the topological phases corresponds to the energy asymptotically reached by gradient descent from a random initial condition, possibly resolving an open problem in out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stiff and Deformable Quasicrystalline Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architected materials achieve unique mechanical properties through precisely engineered microstructures that minimize material usage. However, a key challenge of low-density materials is balancing high stiffness with stable deformability up to large strains. Current microstructures, which employ slender elements such as thin beams and plates arranged in periodic patterns to optimize stiffness, are largely prone to instabilities, including buckling and brittle collapse at low strains. This challenge is here addressed by introducing a new class of aperiodic architected materials inspired by quasicrystalline lattices. Beam networks derived from canonical quasicrystalline patterns, such as the Penrose tiling in 2D and icosahedral quasicrystals in 3D, are shown to create stiff, stretching-dominated topologies with non-uniform force chain distributions, effectively mitigating the global instabilities observed in periodic designs. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these designs in combining stiffness and stable deformability at large strains, representing a significant advancement in the development of low-density metamaterials for applications requiring high impact resistance and energy absorption. Our results demonstrate the potential of deterministic quasi-periodic topologies to bridge the gap between periodic and random structures, while branching towards uncharted territory in the property space of architected materials.</description>

      <title>Universal semiclassical dynamics in disordered two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered two-dimensional systems is much less understood than the dynamics of disordered chains, mainly due to the lack of appropriate numerical methods. We demonstrate that a single-trajectory version of the fermionic truncated Wigner approximation (fTWA) gives unexpectedly accurate results for the dynamics of one-dimensional (1D) systems with moderate or strong disorder. Additionally, the computational complexity of calculations carried out within this approximation is small enough to enable studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems larger than standard fTWA. Using this method, we analyze the dynamics of interacting spinless fermions propagating on disordered 1D and 2D lattices. We find for both spatial dimensions that the imbalance exhibits a universal dependence on the rescaled time $t/\xi_W$, where in 2D the time-scale $\xi_W$ follows a stretched-exponential dependence on disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Effect: Symmetry Breaking, Twisting, and Giant Disorder Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomically-thin materials based on transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene offer a promising avenue for unlocking the mechanisms underlying the spin Hall effect (SHE) in heterointerfaces. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the SHE for twisted van der Waals heterostructures that fully incorporates twisting and disorder effects, and illustrate the critical role of symmetry breaking in the generation of spin-Hall currents. We find that an accurate treatment of vertex corrections leads to a qualitatively and quantitatively different SHE than that obtained from popular approaches like the ``$i\,\eta$'' and ladder approximations. A pronounced oscillatory behavior of skew-scattering processes with twist angle, $\theta$, is predicted, reflecting a non-trivial interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman effects and yields a vanishing SHE for $\theta = 30^\circ$ and, for graphene-WSe$_2$, an optimal SHE for $\theta \approx 17^\circ$. Our findings reveal disorder and broken symmetries as important knobs to optimize interfacial SHEs.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak symmetry breaking states in stochastic dephasing stabilizer circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies.In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subgroup SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those in chaotic systems. Specifically, for initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks and the negative values of tripartite mutual information. We also find that the spectral form factor for these integrable systems exhibits a ramp. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, the ramp is nonlinear, and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display power-law growth for certain operators and Gaussian dynamics. These findings indicate that information scrambling driven by randomness is distinct from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>
