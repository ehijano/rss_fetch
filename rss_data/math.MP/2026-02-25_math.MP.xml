      <title>A mathematical model for the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonrelativistic system made of two quantum particles constrained to move on a line and a spin located at a fixed point of the line. Initially the two particles are in a maximally entangled state and the spin is down. The first particle interacts with the spin while the second particle is free, i.e., it does not interact neither with the first particle nor with the spin. We rigorously prove that there is a correlation between the state of the spin and the state of the second particle. More precisely, we show that, in a suitable scaling limit, if the first particle flips the spin, then the second particle possesses a definite momentum in the direction opposite to the spin.</description>

      <title>Perturbative anomalies in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a cohomological approach to studying perturbative anomalies in quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ together with the symmetry generator $\hat{S}$ forms a unitary representation of the two-dimensional Abelian Lie algebra $g\cong \mathbb{R}^{2}$ on the Hilbert space $V$. We show that perturbations of such a system are related to the first Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology group $H^{1}_{CE}(\mathbb{R}^{2},\mathfrak{u}(V))$. In turn, the perturbative anomalies of the symmetry $\hat{S}$ are related to the second cohomology group $H^{2}_{CE}(\mathbb{R}^{2},\mathfrak{u}(V))$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion properties of stochastic transport by heavy-tailed jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the large-scale transport properties of a passive scalar advected by a turbulent fluid, modelled as a superposition of divergence-free vector fields, each weighted by an independent symmetric $\alpha$-stable-like process. Motivated by recent works showing that complex small-scale spatial structures often lead to Brownian dispersion, we study if this principle persists when the driving noise exhibits heavy-tailed jump statistics. Our numerical results show a clear dichotomy linked with the tail behaviour of the noise. When considering standard $\alpha$-stable processes, very large jumps survive the interaction with the spatial complexity and yield anomalous, super-diffusive transport. In contrast, when the $\alpha$-stable noise is either truncated or exponentially tempered, suppressing extremely long jumps, the transport undergoes a transition to a classical diffusive regime.</description>

      <title>Relating auxiliary field formulations of $4d$ duality-invariant and $2d$ integrable field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21982v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auxiliary field techniques have recently gained interest in four-dimensional non-linear electrodynamics and two-dimensional integrable sigma models. In these settings, coupling a suitable ``seed'' theory to auxiliary fields provides a powerful mechanism to generate infinite families of models while preserving key dynamical properties, such as electromagnetic duality invariance in four dimensions and classical integrability in two dimensions. Deformations induced through auxiliary fields are closely related to $T\bar{T}$-like deformations and, in two dimensions, also to their higher-spin generalisations. In this paper, we analyse and clarify the relations between different auxiliary field formulations in two and four dimensions, showing how they are governed by Legendre transformations of the interaction functions combined with appropriate field redefinitions. In four-dimensional electrodynamics, we establish a correspondence between the auxiliary field model of Russo and Townsend and the Ivanov--Zupnik formalism. In two dimensions, we develop the analogue of the Ivanov--Zupnik $\mu$-frame to deform Principal Chiral, symmetric-space, non-Abelian T-dual, and (bi-)Yang-Baxter sigma models. We discuss how integrability is preserved and use properties of the $\mu$-frame to further extend known families of integrable deformations.</description>

      <title>Conformally-flat gravitational analogues to the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle creation for scalar fields in conformally flat spacetimes using resummed heat-kernel techniques. We make use of an analogy between quantum scalar fields in conformally flat spacetimes and scalar field theories with a Yukawa coupling in Minkowski space. The correspondence holds exactly at the level of the effective action and includes nonconformal curvature couplings. This framework provides access to particle creation at strong curvature. In a radiation dominated universe, the particle production rates in arbitrary dimensions are independently confirmed through explicit calculations of the Bogoliubov coefficients. We also find new exact gravitational analogues of the Schwinger effect in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Poisson Hamiltonian Pontryagin Dynamics and Optimal Control of Mechanical Systems on Lie Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of Pontryagin dynamics for optimal control of mechanical systems on Lie groupoids. The reduced dynamics is formulated intrinsically on the dual Lie algebroid endowed with its canonical linear Poisson structure and evolves on its symplectic leaves. The main result of this work shows that symplectic leaves, rather than coadjoint orbits, provide the natural reduced phase spaces for Pontryagin dynamics on Lie groupoids. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we prove the equivalence between the variational formulation of the optimal control problem and the associated Poisson Hamiltonian Pontryagin system, and we show that groupoid invariant Lagrangians lead to reduced optimality conditions of Euler Poincare type. Several mechanical examples, including systems with configuration dependent inertia and local symmetries, are presented to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $G$-equivariant noncommutative minimal model program ($G$-NMMP), as an equivariant generalization of the framework introduced in arXiv:2301.13168. The aim of this program is to construct quasi-convergent paths in the spaces of Bridgeland stability conditions on derived categories of $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves. For finite groups, we employ induction techniques to construct such paths from the non-equivariant setting. In the setting of algebraic group actions, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb T$-stability conditions to reformulate the proposal, and then we construct quasi-convergent paths for equivariant projective spaces from small quantum cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This brief note is written with a somewhat similar purpose to Earman's 2011 paper on the conceptual problems on the Unruh effect. However, we confine ourselves to Sewell's modular approach to the Unruh effect, which is based on the theorems of Tomita-Takesaki and Bisognano-Wichmann. This approach is rigorous, and has an advantage of being model-independent. However, we will see that a number of conceptual problems remain unsolved on this approach.</description>

      <title>Numerical ranges of non-normal random matrices: elliptic Ginibre and non-Hermitian Wishart ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical range of a non-normal matrix plays a central role as a descriptor of non-normal effects beyond spectral information. We study a class of fundamental non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles that interpolate between the Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Our analysis focuses on the elliptic Ginibre ensemble and its chiral counterpart, as well as on non-Hermitian Wishart matrices. For each of these models, we explicitly characterise the geometry of the numerical range in the large-system limit. In particular, we show that for the elliptic Ginibre ensemble and its chiral version, the limiting numerical range is an ellipse, whereas for the non-Hermitian Wishart ensemble it is described by a non-elliptic envelope.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit design from a retraction-based Riemannian optimization framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing quantum circuits for ground state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However, standard Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are often constrained by limited ansatz expressivity and difficult optimization landscapes. To address these issues, we adopt a geometric perspective, formulating the problem as the minimization of an energy cost function directly over the unitary group. We establish a retraction-based Riemannian optimization framework for this setting, ensuring that all algorithmic procedures are implementable on quantum hardware. Within this framework, we unify existing randomized gradient approaches under a Riemannian Random Subspace Gradient Projection (RRSGP) method. While recent geometric approaches have predominantly focused on such first-order gradient descent techniques, efficient second-order methods remain unexplored. To bridge this gap, we derive explicit expressions for the Riemannian Hessian and show that it can be estimated directly on quantum hardware via parameter-shift rules. Building on this, we propose the Riemannian Random Subspace Newton (RRSN) method, a scalable second-order algorithm that constructs a Newton system from measurement data. Numerical simulations indicate that RRSN achieves quadratic convergence, yielding high-precision ground states in significantly fewer iterations compared to both existing first-order approaches and standard VQA baselines. Ultimately, this work provides a systematic foundation for applying a broader class of efficient Riemannian algorithms to quantum circuit design.</description>

      <title>On the Mathematical Analysis and Physical Implications of the Principle of Minimum Pressure Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a two-way equivalence between the incompressible Navier- Stokes equation (INSE) and the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). We prove that a candidate smooth flow field is a solution of the INSE if and only if its instantaneous evolution minimizes, at every instant, the norm of the pressure force, required to enforce incompressibility. We show that the PMPG is precisely the minimization formulation of the Leray-Helmholtz projection. Any admissible instantaneous evolution (e.g., onset of separation) resulting from the INSE necessarily minimizes the PMPG cost. Conversely, any other kinematically admissible evolution, requiring a strictly larger pressure force to ensure the same constraints, does not satisfy the INSE. Thus, the PMPG offers a variational perspective through which intricate incompressible flow behaviors may be interpreted.
  In a finite-dimensional setting with divergence-free modes, we show that the PMPG yields the same dynamics as classical Galerkin projection. Moreover, the PMPG provides a natural generalization of classical Galerkin projection beyond linear modal expansions, accommodating nonlinear and non-modal representations. We then examine the relation between instantaneous dynamical minimization and steady variational selection, including its connection to the variational theory of lift. Motivated by these observations, we formulate conjectures concerning necessary conditions for stability and the convergence of Navier-Stokes solutions to Euler's in the vanishing-viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable numerical schemes for divergence diminishing Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low equations for plasma flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low (CGL) equations are a set of hyperbolic PDEs with non-conservative products used to model the plasma flows, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not valid, and the pressure tensor is assumed to be rotated by the magnetic field. This results in the pressure tensor, which is described by the two scalar components. As the magnetic field also evolves, controlling the divergence of the magnetic field is important. In this work, we consider the generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique for the CGL model. The resulting model is referred to as the GLM-CGL system. To make the system suitable for entropy-stable schemes, we reformulate the GLM-CGL system by treating some conservative terms as non-conservative. The resulting system has a non-conservative part that does not affect entropy evolution. We then propose entropy stable numerical methods for the GLM-CGL model. The numerical results for the GLM-CGL system are then compared with the CGL system without the GLM divergence diminishing approach to demonstrate that the GLM approach indeed leads to significant improvement in the magnetic field divergence diminishing.</description>

      <title>Continuous Data Assimilation for Semilinear Parabolic Equations: A General Approach by Evolution Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops a general framework for continuous deterministic data assimilation for semilinear parabolic equations by means of evolution equations. Introducing a nudged model driven by partial observations, the global well-posedness of the reference and the approximating systems is established under natural assumptions. In addition, it is shown that the approximating solution converges exponentially to the solution of the reference system, provided the observational resolution and the nudging parameter are suitably chosen. The approach allows us to consider many systems, such as the Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, Sellers-type energy balance, and bidomain systems, for the first time.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of parabolic Hecke algebras and applications to Schur-Weyl duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an eye to applications to type A and Schur-Weyl duality, we study Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for a general parabolic Hecke algebra. Parabolic Hecke algebras are idempotent subalgebras of Hecke algebras corresponding to parabolic subgroups, and for type A they coincide with the fused Hecke algebras appearing in a generalisation of the Schur-Weyl duality with the quantum group of GL(N). In this paper we investigate two different Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for parabolic Hecke algebras, together with the associated cells and the corresponding representations. We quickly specialise to type A, for which we describe the cells in terms of the RSK correspondence generalising thus the well-known description for the symmetric group. As a first application we recover the classification of irreducible representations of parabolic Hecke algebras of type A and provide a new construction of these representations. Next we turn to the Schur-Weyl duality and describe the kernel in terms of one the basis studied precedently. Moreover, we formulate some conjectures about a generator of these kernels in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements, give some evidence and prove these conjectures in some special cases.</description>

Abstract: Matter interacts through two long range forces: gravity and electromagnetism. While all matter contributes to the gravitational potential, electromagnetic effects were traditionally expected to cancel in large systems because positive and negative charges balance. Yet astrophysical objects clearly show long range electromagnetic behavior, so the cancellation cannot be perfect. This paper develops a model for stationary aggregation of matter into a star that consistently includes angular momentum and electromagnetic effects. We reformulate the standard polytropic stellar model as a variational problem and extend it to include the kinetic energy of rigid rotation and the electromagnetic interaction energy between oppositely charged baryonic matter. The electromagnetic contribution to the action is taken to be the minimal energy required to generate the stellar magnetic dipole moment. This energy has two parts: the pure electromagnetic contribution, expressible as a surface integral, and the free energy difference between magnetized and unmagnetized matter, obtained by analyzing a degenerate electron gas in a background of cold ions. Differential forms provide a convenient mathematical framework. The resulting model incorporates electromagnetic effects into stellar structure in a way consistent with linearized general relativity. Although the full system forms a complex open boundary problem, exact solutions exist under simplifying assumptions. The phase diagram predicted by the simplified model shows patterns that may motivate further study of the balance between matter, gravitation, and electromagnetism</description>

      <title>The half-wave maps equation on $\mathbb{T}$: Global well-posedness in $H^{1/2}$ and almost periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the half-wave maps equation $$ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} $$ for $\mathbf{u} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{S}^2$, where $\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$ is the one-dimensional torus and $\mathbb{S}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ denotes the unit sphere. By extension from rational initial data, we construct a unique and continuous flow map for data in the critical energy space $H^{1/2}(\mathbb{T}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Moreover, we show almost periodicity in time of these solutions. For the dense subset of rational initial data, we establish quasi-periodicity in time and a-priori bounds on $\| \mathbf{u}(t) \|_{H^s(\mathbb{T})}$ for any $s &gt;0$.
  Our analysis relies crucially on an explicit formula arising from the Lax pair structure acting on a Hardy space of vector-valued holomorphic functions on the unit disk. As a central ingredient, we develop a general {\em stability principle} for explicit formulae associated with completely integrable PDEs possessing a Lax pair structure on Hardy spaces, including the Benjamin--Ono equation, Calogero--Sutherland DNLS, and the half-wave-maps equation posed on $\mathbb{T}$.
  Our results extend to the matrix-valued half-wave maps equation $$ \partial_t \mathbf{U} = -\frac{i}{2} [ \mathbf{U}, |D| \mathbf{U} ] $$ with target manifold given by the complex Grassmannians $\mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$, thereby generalizing the special case $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1 \cong \mathsf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^2)$. In a companion work, we prove global well-posedness for the half-wave maps equation posed on $\mathbb{R}$ in the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}$, by establishing a stability principle for explicit formulae on Hardy spaces in the complex half-plane $\mathbb{C}_+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Maxwell extension of kinematical Lie algebras by promoting the contraction method underlying the Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond cube to a semigroup expansion framework. Within this approach, we show that both non- and ultra-relativistic Maxwell algebras admitting non-degenerate invariant bilinear forms can be systematically obtained from different parent algebras through a unified expansion scheme, leading to a Maxwellian kinematical cube. This construction is further generalized to an infinite hierarchy of kinematical algebras. The expansion method naturally provides the corresponding invariant tensors, allowing for the systematic construction of three-dimensional Chern-Simons gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Generating twisted Cherednik eigenfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonians ${\cal H}^{a}_k$ of new integrable systems associated with the integer rays $(1,a)$ (commutative subalgebras) of Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra in the $N$-body representation are closely related to commuting twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians $\mathfrak{C}_i^{(a)}$, ${\cal H}^{a}_k = \sum_{i=1}^N (\mathfrak{C}_i^{(a)})^k$. Moreover, symmetric combinations of eigenfunctions in the twisted Cherednik system were recently shown to produce the DIM Hamiltonian eigenstates. We explicitly construct these twisted Cherednik eigenfunctions recurrently by action of some (creation and permutation) operations. It resembles of a far-going generalization of Kirillov-Noumi operators, but exact relation remains to be specified.</description>

      <title>Scalar Lie point symmetries of the Standard Model with one or two real gauge singlets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classification of all scalar Lie point symmetries of the Standard Model with one or two real gauge-singlet scalars (SM+S and SM+2S). By analyzing the associated field equations, we identify all realizable and inequivalent Lie point symmetry algebras of these models, distinguishing strict variational, variational (including divergence symmetries), and Euler--Lagrange cases. In addition, we devise efficient algorithms that, for any given numerical instance of the models, determine the Lie point symmetry algebra in each of the three categories by a parameter-based decision procedure using affine reparametrizations and simple parameter tests, thereby avoiding explicit symmetry analysis and the need to derive and solve the determining equations. Finally, we prove several relevant general results, including a characterization of the three disjoint types of Lie point symmetry generators -- strict variational, divergence, and non-variational -- for a broad class of Lagrangians with potentials, including the SM+S and SM+2S.</description>

      <title>Geometric QCD II: The Confining Twistor String and Meson Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a continuum framework for confining planar QCD ($N_c\to\infty$) by quantizing the Fermi-string (1981) degrees of freedom on the rigid Hodge-dual minimal surface of Geometric QCD I. Worldsheet Majorana fermions provide the algebraic mechanism required by the Makeenko-Migdal loop equations: the Pauli principle cancels non-planar self-intersections, preserving planar factorization. The Liouville instability of random surfaces is avoided since the bulk geometry is rigidly fixed holographically by the boundary loop, without summing over fluctuating metrics.
  Formulating the theory in momentum loop space integrates out coordinate-space cusp singularities, yielding a finite local limit for quark-loop amplitudes. Changing variables in the phase-space path integral, after fixing reparametrization symmetry (Virasoro constraint), parametrizes the reduced measure by boundary twistors and an induced Jacobian. This yields a twistor-string integral derived directly from the planar QCD amplitude.
  In the local limit, the theory becomes an analytic twistor string: a boundary sigma model $S^1\to (S^3\times S^3)/S^1$ coupled to a holographically determined Liouville field $\rho(z,\bar z)=\log(|\lambda(z)||\mu(z)|)$ obtained by analytic continuation of boundary twistor data.
  The meson spectrum is encoded in a 1D functional integral over the boundary twistor trajectory $\lambda(z),\mu(z)$ on $|z|=1$. While evaluated numerically via a reweighted Complex Langevin approach (extracting linear Regge trajectories as a proof of concept), our ultimate finding is analytical. Analyzing complexified effective action monodromies reveals the discrete mass spectrum is exactly governed by Catastrophe Theory and classified by the topological number of twistor poles inside the unit circle. The 1-pole sector exactly yields $m^2 = \pi \sigma (n + 1/12)$.</description>

      <title>A Novel Explicit Filter for the Approximate Deconvolution in Large-Eddy Simulation on General Unstructured Grids: A posteriori tests on highly stretched grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit filters play a pivotal role in the scale separation and numerical stability of advanced Large Eddy Simulation (LES) closures, such as dynamic eddy-viscosity or Approximate Deconvolution (AD) methods. In the present study, it is demonstrated that the performance of commonly used explicit filters applicable to general unstructured grids highly depends on the grid configuration, specifically the cell aspect ratio, which can result in poor filter spectral properties, ultimately leading to large errors and even solution divergence. This study introduces a novel, efficient explicit filter for general unstructured grids, addressing this shortcoming through a combination of a face-averaging technique and recursive filtering. The filter parameters are then determined through a constrained multi-objective optimization, ensuring desirable spectral properties, including high-wavenumber attenuation, filter-width precision, filter stability and positivity, and minimized dispersion and commutation errors. The AD-LES of turbulent channel flow benchmarks using the new filter demonstrate a noticeable improvement in turbulent flow predictions on highly stretched boundary-layer-type grids, particularly in reducing the log-layer mean velocity profile mismatch, compared to simulations using conventional filters. The analyses show that this enhancement is mainly attributed to the sufficient level of attenuation near the Nyquist wavenumber achieved by the new filter in all spatial directions across various grid configurations, among others. The new filter was also successfully tested on unstructured prism grids for the 3D Taylor-Green vortex benchmark.</description>

Abstract: All isometrically invariant Markov (strictly local) fields on binary assignments are induced by energy functions that can be represented as linear combinations of area, perimeter, and Euler characteristic. This class of model includes the Ising model, both ferro- and antiferro-magnetic, with and without a field, as well as the "triplet" Ising model We determine the low-temperature behavior for this class of model, and construct a phase diagram of that behavior. In particular, we identify regions with three geometric phases, regions with a single unique phase, and coexistence lines between them.</description>

      <title>On Topology of Perturbed Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-helicity vortices, such as Hill's vortex and field-reversed configurations (FRCs), have long been assumed to be toroidal in topology. This paper proves this assumption false: even under arbitrarily small odd-parity (with respect to the z-axis of symmetry) perturbations, flux surfaces in the interior region become simply connected in topology with crescent-shaped boundaries. A new inner separatrix emerges, separating toroidal flux surfaces in an intermediate region from simply connected surfaces in the core. In a spherical vortex with perturbations at roughly 10% of the background field strength, the simply connected region occupies ~40% of the total closed-field-line volume. The analysis rigorously proves the conjecture regarding field-line closure under odd-parity perturbations in a full three-dimensional context, completing previous partial proofs in two-dimensional geometry. Preliminary numerical simulations of charged particle trajectories in field-reversed configurations revealed crescent-shaped drift surfaces even for small gyroradii. Given that FRCs are sustained by rotating magnetic fields with odd parity, these results motivate a revision of FRC-related fusion confinement physics. Furthermore, given the mathematical equivalence to Hill's vortex, this updates our topological understanding of fluid flow in a wide array of phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an analytical formula for the quasicoherent states of 3D fuzzy spaces defined by algebras generated by bosonic creation and annihilation operators. This one is expressed in a representation onto the coherent states of the CCR algebra. Such a fuzzy space can be assimilated to a noncommutative D2-brane of the M-theory (but also as a model of a qubit in contact with a bosonic environment). We apply this formula onto a D2-brane wrapped around an axis to obtain the geometry of a noncommutative cylinder. We show that the adiabatic transport of its quasicoherent states exhibits a topological effect similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We study also a D2-brane wrapped and twisted to have the geometry of a noncommutative Mobius strip. Finally we briefly present the other two examples of a noncommutative torus and of a noncommutative Klein bottle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transition between short-range entangled (SRE) and long-range ordered (and therefore long-range entangled) states of infinite quantum spin chains, which is induced by local measurements. Specifically, we assume that the initial state is in a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phase with local symmetry group $\mathcal{G} = G \times H$, where $G$ is an Abelian subgroup. We show that the on-site measurements of the local $G$-charge on intervals of increasing lengths transform the initial SRE state into a family of states with increasingly long-range correlations. In particular, the post-measurement states cannot be uniformly short-range entangled. In the case where the initial state is obtained from a product state using a quantum cellular automaton, we construct the infinite-volume post-measurement state and exhibit almost local observables that are maximally correlated.</description>

Abstract: We consider the classical Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with timelike boundary and show well-posedness of the Cauchy initial-boundary value problem coupled to APS-boundary conditions. This is achieved by deriving suitable energy estimates, which play a fundamental role in establishing uniqueness and existence of weak solutions. Finally, by introducing suitable mollifier operators, we study the differentiability of the solutions. For obtaining smoothness we need additional technical conditions.</description>

      <title>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03745v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</description>

Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the Borel half of $Uq (gl(1|1))$ and of the $Uq (gl(1|1))$ when q is a root of unity. We also study the Borel half of Uq (osp(1|2)) for both cases when qis a root of unity and when it is not. We prove the isomorphism between the Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras, which is missing in the literature, and extend the isomorphism to the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the Z2-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory [1, 2], as well as illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the $Uq (gl(1|1))$ Hopf algebra for q being a root of unity. In addition, we generalise an isomorphism between the Drinfeld double and the loop algebra from the Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation to the graded setting.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new identity for Feynman periods that acts on five-vertex cuts of completed primitive Feynman graphs. It is shown that in $\phi^4$ theory this identity is independent from existing identities which are the twist, the Fourier identity and the Fourier split.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or "covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

      <title>Stability of thermal equilibrium in long-range quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16451v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound, and hence that stability always holds at high temperature. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analog simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Metric-Induced Principal Symbols in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometrical formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics by expressing its principal symbol as an optical metric-induced object. Under the assumption of no birefringence, we show that the evolution of linear perturbations can be recast as a covariant divergence on a curved, field-dependent background, enabling the application of quantum field theory techniques as in Maxwell's theory in curved backgrounds. This geometric reformulation opens a new route for analogue models potentially implementable in laboratory via tailored nonlinear metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent breathtaking progress in the synthetic study of Lorentzian geometry, we investigate the local concavity of time separation functions on Finsler spacetimes as a Lorentzian counterpart to Busemann's convexity in metric geometry. We show that a Berwald spacetime is locally concave if and only if its flag curvature is nonnegative in timelike directions. We also give another characterization of nonnegative flag curvature by the convexity of future (or past) capsules, inspired by Krist\'aly--Kozma's result in the positive definite case. These characterizations are new even for Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Could an overlooked symmetry of the classical laws of gravity explain the cosmological puzzles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if the masses of timelike fields are point-dependent quantities transforming under conformal transformations as $m\rightarrow\Omega^{-1}m$, and the energy density of perfect fluids transforms as $\rho\rightarrow\Omega^{-4}\rho$, form-invariance under Weyl transformations is an actual symmetry of the gravitational interactions of matter. That is, under the mentioned circumstances, Weyl symmetry allows any matter field to be coupled to gravity. The phenomenological and physical consequences of the novel result, including the ``many worlds'' interpretation of gauge freedom, are drawn. We explore, in particular, a possible explanation of two major cosmological puzzles: dark matter and dark energy, as a consequence of Weyl symmetry. Quantum-mechanical removal of the spacetime singularities in this framework is briefly discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry Breaking with Fields, Strings and Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1 supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes, and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric string vacua.</description>

      <title>Query complexities of quantum channel discrimination and estimation: A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.</description>

      <title>CLT for the trace functional of the IDS of magnetic random Schr\"{o}dinger operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the existence of the integrated density of states (IDS) of the magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a random potential on the Hilbert space \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \), as an analogue of the law of large numbers (LLN) for trace functionals. In this work, we establish an analogue of the central limit theorem (CLT), which describes the fluctuations of the trace functionals of the IDS, for a class of test functions denoted by \( C^1_{d,0}(\mathbb{R}) \). This class consists of real-valued, continuously differentiable functions on \( \mathbb{R} \) that decay at the rate \( O(|x|^{-m}) \) as \( |x| \to \infty \), where \( m &gt; d + 1 \).</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $O (N)$ linear sigma model and its mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study large $N$ limits of the hyperbolic $O(N)$ linear sigma model ($\text{HLSM}_N$) on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, namely, a system of $N$ interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) with coupled cubic nonlinearities. After establishing (pathwise) global well-posedness of $\text{HLSM}_N$ and the limiting equation, called the mean-field SdNLW, we first establish global-in-time convergence of $\text{HLSM}_N$ to the mean-field SdNLW with general initial data (under a suitable assumption). In particular, for the local-in-time convergence, we obtain an optimal convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12}$ under an additional integrability assumption on initial data. We then show that the invariant Gibbs dynamics for $\text{HLSM}_N$ converges to that for the mean-field SdNLW with a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12}$ on any large time intervals.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schur limit, modular differential equations and quantum monodromy traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore some aspects of the generalized Schur limit, defined in arXiv:2506.13764. Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $\alpha$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $\alpha$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $\alpha$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of (1+2)-dimensional linear partial differential of Asian options pricing. Special cases have been used to models of financial mathematics. We carry out group classification of a class equations. In particular, the maximum dimension Lie invariance algebra within the above class is eight-dimensional. It is shown that an equation with such an algebra can be transformed into the linear Kolmogorov equation with the help of the point transformations of variables. Using the operators of invariance algebra symmetry reduction is carried out and invariant exact solutions are constructed for some equations.</description>
