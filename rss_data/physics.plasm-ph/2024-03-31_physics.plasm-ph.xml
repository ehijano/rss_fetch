      <title>All-optical blast wave control of laser wakefield acceleration in near critical plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for changing the length of laser wakefield electron acceleration in a gas jet by a cylindrical blast wave created by a perpendicularly focused nanosecond laser pulse. The shock front destroys the wake thus stopping interaction between the laser pulse and accelerated electron bunch allowing one to directly control the interaction length and avoid dephasing. It also improves the electron beam quality through the plasma lensing effect between the two shock fronts. We demonstrated both experimentally and numerically how this approach can be used to form quasi-monoenergetic electron bunch with controlled energy and improved divergence as well as to track changes in the bunch parameters during acceleration.</description>

      <title>An ultraviolet photodetector based on conductive hydrogenated TiO$_2$ film prepared by radio frequency atmospheric pressure plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for real-time ultraviolet (UV) monitoring calls for a simple, rapid, and low-cost strategy to prepare UV photodetectors. We prepare a wearable real-time UV photodetector based on hydrogenated titanium dioxide film synthesized by radio frequency atmospheric pressure plasma. The conductivity of our hydrogenated titanium dioxide is improved to 10.2 S cm$^{-1}$, 9 orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine titanium dioxide after 10 min plasma treatment. Plasma hydrogenation disrupts the surface crystal structure, introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) that create self-doped titanium(III) and titanium (II) species. First-principles calculations indicate the OVs raise the Fermi level of TiO$_2$ and distort the lattice nearby. Our optimized film has a distinctive periodic switching characteristic under intermittent illumination and good responsivity from 280 - 400 nm, peaking at 632.35 mA W^{-1}$ at 365 nm. The fabricated wearable sensor based on the optimized film effectively performs the monitoring of the daily variation of ambient UV intensity in three typical weather types and transferring its data to a smartphone via Wi-Fi.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of Magneto-Inertial, Differentially Rotating Laboratory Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of the structure and evolution of differentially rotating plasmas driven on the MAGPIE pulsed-power generator (1.4 MA peak current, 240 ns rise-time). The experiments were designed to simulate physics relevant to accretion discs and jets on laboratory scales. A cylindrical aluminium wire array Z pinch enclosed by return posts with an overall azimuthal off-set angle was driven to produce ablation plasma flows that propagate inwards in a slightly off-radial trajectory, injecting mass, angular momentum, and confining ram pressure to a rotating plasma column on the axis. However, the plasma is free to expand axially, forming a collimated, differentially rotating axial jet that propagates at $\approx 100$ km/s. The density profile of the jet corresponds to a dense shell surrounding a low-density core, which is consistent with the centrifugal barrier effect being sustained along the jet's propagation. We show analytically that, as the rotating plasma accretes mass, conservation of mass and momentum implies plasma radial growth scaling as $r \propto t^{1/3}$. As the characteristic moment of inertia increases, the rotation velocity is predicted to decrease and settle on a characteristic value $\approx 20$ km/s. We find that both predictions are in agreement with Thomson scattering and optical self-emission imaging measurements.</description>
