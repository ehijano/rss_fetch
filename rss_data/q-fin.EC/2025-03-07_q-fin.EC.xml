      <title>Managing Procurement Auction Failure: Bid Requirements or Reserve Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines bid requirements, where the government may cancel a procurement contract unless two or more bids are received. Using a first-price auction model with endogenous entry, we compare the bid requirement and reserve price mechanisms in terms of auction failure and procurement costs. We find that reserve prices result in lower procurement costs and substantially lower failure probabilities, especially when entry costs are high, or signals are sufficiently informative. Bid requirements are more likely to result in zero entry, while reserve prices can sustain positive entry under broader conditions.</description>

      <title>Persistent gender attitudes and women entrepreneurship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do persistent gender norms affect women's current startup activity? We investigate whether historical gender norms - measured by Switzerland's 1981 public referendum on enshrining gender equality as a constitutional right - influence female startup activity today. Using data from all 2,308 Swiss municipalities from 2016 to 2023, we show that gender norms have persisted over the past 42 years. Municipalities with a higher share of votes in favor of gender equality have a statistically and economically significantly higher ratio of women-founded to men-founded startups. The average elasticity of this ratio with respect to the 1981 vote is 0.2. These findings indicate that gender norms have persisted in Switzerland, despite mass immigration and the unprecedented economic growth the country has experienced over the past four decades. This result remains robust even after controlling for a later referendum on gender roles and a wide range of municipality-specific control variables, and the effect is stronger for non-growth-oriented firms than for growth-oriented startups.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to apply economic complexity to identify diversification opportunities often rely on diagrams comparing the relatedness and complexity of products, technologies, or industries. Yet, the use of these diagrams, is not based on empirical or theoretical evidence supporting some notion of optimality. Here, we introduce a method to identify diversification opportunities based on the minimization of a cost function that captures the constraints imposed by an economy's pattern of specialization and show that this ECI optimization algorithm produces recommendations that are substantially different from those obtained using relatedness-complexity diagrams. This method advances the use of economic complexity methods to explore questions of strategic diversification.</description>

      <title>Welfare Effects of Self-Preferencing by a Platform: Empirical Evidence from Airbnb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the welfare effects of self-preferencing by Airbnb, a practice where Airbnb utilizes its pricing algorithm to prioritize maximizing platform-wide commission revenue rather than optimizing individual host revenues. To examine this welfare implication, I construct a Bertrand competition model with differentiated products between Airbnb hosts and hotels. Using unique data from Tokyo's 23 wards, I estimate the model and conduct counterfactual simulations to evaluate the welfare effects of self-preferencing. Counterfactual simulations reveal that self-preferencing reduces social welfare by 5.08% on average, equivalent to an annual loss of about 14.90% of Tokyo's vacation rental market size in 2023 while increasing Airbnb's commission revenue by an average of 37.73%. These findings highlight the significant trade-offs between platform-driven revenue optimization and market efficiency, emphasizing the urgent need for competition policy reforms and greater transparency and accountability in platform practices.</description>

      <title>Ownership Chains in Multinational Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how multinational enterprises (MNEs) structure ownership chains to coordinate subsidiaries across multiple national borders. Using a unique global dataset, we first document key stylized facts: 54% of subsidiaries are controlled through indirect ownership, and ownership chains can span up to seven countries. In particular, we find that subsidiaries further down the hierarchy tend to be more geographically distant from the parent and often operate in different time zones. This suggests that the ease of communication along ownership chains is a critical determinant of their structure. Motivated by these findings, we develop a location choice model in which parent firms compete for corporate control of final subsidiaries. When monitoring is costly, they may delegate control to an intermediate affiliate in another jurisdiction. The model generates a two-stage empirical strategy: (i) a trilateral equation that determines the location of an intermediate affiliate conditional on the location of final subsidiaries; and (ii) a bilateral equation that predicts the location of final investment. Our empirical estimates confirm that the ease of communication at the country level significantly influences the location decisions of affiliates along ownership chains. These findings underscore the importance of organizational frictions in shaping global corporate structures and provide new insights into the geography of multinational ownership networks.</description>
