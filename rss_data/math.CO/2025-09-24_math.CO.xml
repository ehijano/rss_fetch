      <title>An Inductive Proof that Lights Out Configurations are Invertible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary inductive proof of a classical result for the \emph{Lights Out problem} on graphs: from any configuration of vertices, one can reach the complementary configuration by a sequence of moves, where a move consists of toggling a vertex and its neighbors. Unlike the usual linear-algebraic approach over $\mathbb{F}_2$, our argument is purely combinatorial.</description>

      <title>Graph entropy, degree assortativity, and hierarchical structures in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect several notions relating the structural and dynamical properties of a graph. Among them are the topological entropy coming from the vertex shift, which is related to the spectral radius of the graph's adjacency matrix, the Randi\'c index, and the degree assortativity. We show that, among all connected graphs with the same degree sequence, the graph having maximum entropy is characterized by a hierarchical structure; namely, it satisfies a breadth-first search ordering with decreasing degrees (BFD-ordering for short). Consequently, the maximum-entropy graph necessarily has high degree assortativity; furthermore, for such a graph the degree centrality and eigenvector centrality coincide. Moreover, the notion of assortativity is related to the general Randi\'c index. We prove that the graph that maximizes the Randi\'{c} index satisfies a BFD-ordering. For trees, the converse holds as well. We also define a normalized Randi\'c function and show that its maximum value equals the difference of Shannon entropies of two probability distributions defined on the edges and vertices of the graph based on degree correlations.</description>

      <title>Universal perspectives on irredundance for X-set parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal definitions of irredundance for X-set parameters are presented using blocking sets. This approach is modeled on (domination) irredundance (which uses closed neighborhoods as blocking sets) and zero forcing irredundance (which uses forts). Results include a chain of inequalities between irredundance parameters and original parameters and the isomorphism theorem for TAR reconfiguration graphs of many irredundance parameters. These results are then applied to PSD forcing irredundance and vertex cover irredundance; the chain of inequalities also applies to skew forcing irredundance. The upper vertex cover irredundance number becomes part of the Domination Chain used in the study of (domination) irredundance. Based on the propagation processes involved in forcing, an alternate universal theory of irredundance is developed using closure operators.</description>

      <title>Cops and robbers on chess graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cops and robbers is a pursuit-evasion game played on graphs. We completely classify the cop numbers for $n \times n$ knight graphs and queen graphs. This completes the classification of the cop numbers for all $n \times n$ classical chess graphs. As a corollary, we resolve an open problem about the monotonicity of $c$($\mathcal{Q}_n$). Moreover, we introduce \emph{royal graphs}, a generalization of chess graphs for arbitrary piece movements, which models real-life movement constraints. We give results on the cop numbers for these families.</description>

      <title>Strong chordality in tournaments and multipartite tournaments with possible loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly chordal digraphs are included in the class of chordal digraphs and generalize strongly chordal graphs and chordal bipartite graphs. They are the digraphs that admit a linear ordering of its vertex set for which their adjacency matrix does not contain the $\Gamma$ matrix as a submatrix. In general, it is not clear if these digraphs can be recognized in polynomial time. We focus on multipartite tournaments with possible loops. We give a polynomial-time recognition algorithm and a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of the strong chordality for each of the following cases: tournaments with possible loops, reflexive multipartite tournaments, irreflexive bipartite tournaments, irreflexive tournaments minus one arc, and balanced digraphs.
  In addition, we prove that in a strongly chordal digraph the minimum size of a total dominating set equals the maximum number of disjoint in-neighborhoods, and this number can be calculated in linear time given a $\Gamma$-free ordering of the input graph.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Cliques into $k$-Star-Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-star-forest is a forest with at most $k$ connected components where each component is a star. Let $F_k(n)$ be the minimum integer such that the complete graph on $n$ vertices can be decomposed into $F_k(n)$ $k$-star-forests. Pach, Saghafian and Schnider showed that $F_2(n)=\lceil 3n/4 \rceil$. In this paper, we show that $F_3(n)=5n/9$ when $n$ is a multiple of 27. Further, for $k\ge 4$, we show that $F_k(n)=n/2+2$ when $n&gt;2k$ and $n\equiv 4 \pmod{12}$. Our results disprove a conjecture of Pach, Saghafian and Schnider.</description>

      <title>Spectral extrema of graphs of given even size forbidding H(4,3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is sad to be $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. Let $H(k,3)$ be the graph formed by taking a cycle of length $k$ and a triangle on a common vertex. Li, Lu and Peng [Discrete Math. 346 (2023) 113680] proved that if $G$ is an $H(3,3)$-free graph of size $m \geq 8$, then the spectral radius $\rho(G) \leq \frac{1+\sqrt{4 m-3}}{2}$ with equality if and only if $G \cong S_{\frac{m+3}{2}, 2}$, where $S_{\frac{m+3}{2}, 2}=K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2}K_1$. Note that the bound is attainable only when $m$ is odd. Recently, Pirzada and Rehman [Comput. Appl. Math. 44 (2025) 295] proved that if $G$ is an $\{H(3,3),H(4,3)\}$-free graph of even size $m \geq 10$, then $\rho(G) \leq \rho^{\prime}(m)$ with equality if and only if $G \cong S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}^{-}$, where $\rho^{\prime}(m)$ is the largest root of $x^4-m x^2-(m-2) x+\frac{m}{2}-1=0$, and $S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}^{-}$ is the graph obtained from $S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}$ by deleting an edge incident to a vertex of degree two. In this paper, we improve the result of Pirzada and Rehman by showing that if $G$ is an $H(4,3)$-free graph of even size $m \geq 38$ without isolated vertices, then $\rho(G) \leq \rho^{\prime}(m)$ with equality if and only if $G \cong S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}^{-}$.</description>

      <title>A formula for the Jack super nabla operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Jack analog $\nabla(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ of the super nabla operator recently introduced by Bergeron, Haglund, Iraci and Romero for Macdonald polynomials. We prove that $\nabla(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ has a differential expression in the power-sum basis given in terms of Chapuy--Do\l{}e\k{}ga and Nazarov--Sklyanin operators.
  This result is obtained from a more general formula for the operator $G(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ encoding the structure coefficients of Jack characters, from which $\nabla(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ is obtained by taking the top homogeneous part.
  A key step of the proof involves establishing that Chapuy--Do\l{}e\k{}ga operators together with a dehomogenized version of Nazarov--Sklyanin operators have a Heisenberg algebra structure. The proof also uses a characterization of the operator $G(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ with a family of differential equations, recently established by the author.</description>

      <title>Semigroup rings and algebraically independent sequences with respect to idempotents in commutative semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any finite abelian group $G$ and commutative unitary ring $R$, by $R[G]$ we denote the group algebra over $R$. Let $T=(g_1,\ldots,g_{\ell})$ be a sequence over the group $G$. We say $T$ is algebraically zero-sum free over R if $\prod\limits_{i=1}^r(X^{g_i}-a_i)\neq 0\in R[G]$ for all $a_1,\ldots,a_{\ell}\in R\setminus \{0\}$. Let $d(G,R)={\rm sup}\{|T|: T \mbox{ is an algebraically zero-sum free sequence over } R \mbox{ of terms from }G\}.$ This invariant of the group algebra $R[G]$ plays a powerful role in the research for the zero-sum theory. In this paper, we generalize this invariant to the semigroup algebra $R[S]$ for a commutative periodic semigroup $S$. We give the best possible lower and upper bounds for $d(S,R)$ for a general commutative periodic semigroup $S$. In case that $K$ is a field, and $S$ is a finite commutative semigroup, we give more precise result, including the equality for Clifford semigroups, Archimedean semigroups and elementary semigroups, which covers all types of irreducible components associated with the semilattice decomposition and the subdirect product decomposition of a commutative semigroup. Also, the invariant $d(S,K)$ was applied to the study of some zero-sum invariants in semigroups. One conjecture on the equality for $d(S,K)$ in case $K$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero was proposed which has been also partially affirmed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Doubly Stochastic Matrices and Modified Laplacian Matrices of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider modified Laplacian matrices of graphs, obtained by adding the identity matrix to the Laplacian matrix $L_G$ of a graph $G$. This results in a positive definite matrix $\tilde{L}_G$. The inverse of $\tilde{L}_G$ is a doubly stochastic matrix. The goal of this paper is to investigate this inverse matrix and how it depends on properties of the underlying graph $G$. In particular, we introduce a general monotonicity property for the entries of the inverse, and derive a sharper version for the case of path graphs. Finally, we show that, in the case of a path graph, the entries of the inverse can be expressed in terms of Fibonacci numbers via an $LU$ factorization. We also establish a lower bound for the diagonal entries of this inverse for a tree as a function of the distances between vertices. Furthermore, we present a simple and efficient algorithm for computing the inverse when the graph is a tree. Moreover, for a general graph, we show that the diagonal entries of this inverse is strictly largest in each row and column. Finally, we discuss a connection to partial differential equations, such as the heat equation.</description>

      <title>Monophonic number of Kneser graphs and strongly 2-monophonic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ a set $S\subset V(G)$ is called monophonic if every vertex in $G$ lies on some induced path between two vertices in $S$. The monophonic number, $m(G)$, of $G$, which is the smallest cardinality of a monophonic set in $G$, has been studied from various perspectives. In this paper, we establish $m(K(n,r))$ for all Kneser graphs $K(n,r)$, where $n\ge 2r$. In addition, when $r\ge 3$, we prove an even stronger property, notably that every pair of non-adjacent vertices in $K(n,r)$ forms a monophonic set. We call the graphs satisfying this property strongly $2$-monophonic graphs. We present several (sufficient and necessary) conditions for a graph to be strongly $2$-monophonic, and prove that the Cartesian product of any two strongly $2$-monophonic graphs is also such. Besides non-complete Hamming graphs, we also prove that every Johnson graph is strongly $2$-monophonic, whereas chordal graphs, with the exception of the graphs $K_n-e$, do not enjoy this property.</description>

      <title>From finding a spanning subgraph $H$ to an $H$-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical Dirac-type problem in extremal graph theory is to determine the minimum degree threshold for a graph $G$ to have a spanning subgraph $H$, e.g. the Dirac theorem. A natural following up problem would be to seek an $H$-factor, which a spanning set of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$. In this short note, we present a method of obtaining an upper bound on the minimum degree threshold for an $H$-factor from one for finding a spanning copy of $H$.
  As an application, we proved that, for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $\ell$ sufficiently large, any oriented graph $G$ on $\ell m$ vertices with minimum semi-degree $\delta^0(G) \ge (3/8+ \varepsilon) k \ell$ contains a $C_\ell$-factor, where $C_\ell$ is an arbitrary orientation of a cycle on $\ell$ vertices. This improves a result of Wang, Yan and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Perfect Divisibility and Coloring of Some Bull-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is {\em perfectly divisible} if, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])&lt;\omega(H)$. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edge, a {\em fork } is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing an edge once, and an {\em odd torch} is a graph obtained from an odd hole by adding an edge $xy$ such that $x$ is nonadjacent to any vertex on the odd hole and the set of neighbors of $y$ on the odd hole is a stable set.
  Chudnovsky and Sivaraman [J. Graph Theory 90 (2019) 54-60] proved that every (odd hole, bull)-free graph and every ($P_5$, bull)-free graph are perfectly divisible. Karthick {\em et al.} [The Electron. J. of Combin. 29 (2022) P3.19.] proved that every (fork, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Chen and Xu [Discrete Appl. Math. 372 (2025) 298-307.] proved that every ($P_7,C_5$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Let $H\in$\{\{odd~balloon\}, $\{P_8,C_5\}\}$. In this paper, we prove that every ($H$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. We also prove that a ($P_6$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible if and only if it contains no Mycielski-Gr\"{o}tzsch graph as an induced subgraph. As corollaries, these graphs is $\binom{\omega+1}{2}$-colorable. Notice that every odd torch contains an odd hole, a $P_5$, and a fork. Therefore, our results generalize the results of these scholars. Moreover, we prove that every ($P_6$, bull)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\omega(G)^7$.</description>

      <title>Pair state transfer in tensor product and double cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer, first introduced by Bose in 2003, is an important physical phenomenon in quantum networks, which plays a vital role in quantum communication and quantum computing. In 2004, Christandl et al. proposed the concept of perfect state transfer on graphs by modeling the quantum network using graphs, and unveiled the feasibility of applying graph theory to quantum state transfer. In 2018, Chen and Godsil proposed the definition of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer on graphs, which is a brilliant generalization of perfect state transfer. In this paper, we investigate the existence of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer in tensor product and double cover of two regular graphs, respectively, and reveal fundamental connections between perfect state transfer and Laplacian perfect pair state transfer. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the tensor product of two regular graphs to admit Laplacian perfect pair state transfer, where one of the two regular graphs admits perfect state transfer or Laplacian perfect pair state transfer. Additionally, we characterize the existence of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer in the double cover of two regular graphs. By our results, a variety of families of graphs admitting Laplacian perfect pair state transfer can be constructed.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of total-coloring extensions, and focus our attention on planar graphs, asking: ``When can a total-$k$-coloring of some subgraph $H$ of a planar graph $G$ be extended to a total-$k$-coloring of $G$?'' We prove that if $H$ is a matching, then any total-$(\Delta+3)$-coloring of $H$ in $G$ extends to $G$ provided $\Delta\geq 28$; this number of colors is best-possible without introducing a distance condition on $H$. We also prove that if $H$ is a set of distance-3 cliques then any total-$(\Delta+1)$-coloring of $H$ extends to $G$ provided $\Delta\geq 27$; this distance condition cannot be lowered.</description>

      <title>Tight eigenvalue bound on the traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lower bound on the solution to the traveling salesman problem is provided, which is expressed in terms of eigenvalues related to the distance matrix for the problem. This bound has many interesting properties such as transforming appropriately under affine distance transformations and is notably tight for various families of traveling salesman problems with arbitrarily many cities. It is also computed for some real world traveling salesman problems. The eigenvalues in the bound are further related to the Schoenberg criterion from Euclidean geometry. Graph theoretic applications to the Hamiltonian cycle and path problems are given by the fact that the new bound entails necessary graph eigenvalue conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian or traceable. Various non-trivial families of Cayley graphs saturate these Hamiltonicity conditions, thus in a sense providing almost counterexamples to the famous conjecture that all Cayley graphs are Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Meanders and Dyck-Path Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a statistic $\mathsf{traj}$ on the ordered pairs $(P,Q)$ of Dyck paths of size $n$, which counts the number of billiard trajectories in the grid polygon enclosed by $P$ and $-Q$, where $-Q$ is the path obtained by reflecting $Q$ over the ground line. It turns out to coincide with the component statistic of meanders. In terms of grid polygon, we establish an involution on the set of such ordered pairs $(P,Q)$ which either increases or decreases $\mathsf{traj}(P,Q)$ by 1. This proves a result by Di Francesco--Golinelli--Guitter that the numbers of semimeanders (meanders, respectively) of order $n$ with even and odd numbers of components are equal if $n$ is even and differ by a Catalan number (the square of a Catalan number, respectively) if $n$ is odd. Some results about $(-1)$-evaluation of the generating functions for the statistic $\mathsf{traj}$ on restricted sets of Dyck paths are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Terao's freeness conjecture, we examine Ziegler pairs, which are pairs of hyperplane arrangements that share the same underlying matroid but have different modules of logarithmic derivations. In this paper, we present a general construction that yields the first known families of Ziegler pairs in arbitrary dimension and size, starting from examples in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>Interpreting a Sum of Third Powers by using a Geometric Assembly in Four Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new combinatorial proofs of Nicomachus's Theorem for the sum of the third powers of the first n natural numbers. The key step is that we define a 4-dimensional block which comprises unit hyper-cubes. In our first proof we assemble 4 copies of this block to construct a rectangular solid. In our second proof we partition the block into two parts, then map and reassemble them into a solid whose shape is a step triangle along two coordinate axes, and is likewise on the other two. For corollaries we present a q-analogue of this identity using taxicab distance, and we interpret q-analogues from 4 different (sets of) authors, using taxicab distances from different starting points.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy Growth: Efficient growth computations and hundreds of new conjectures on Cayley graphs (Brief version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory. We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and Schreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles much larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.
  Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric groups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of quadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is a general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem being NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on diameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to previous O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to involutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the diameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an answer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs generated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.
  For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results on upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of diameter on p. Moreover.
  Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems verifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created more than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth computation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many groups exhibiting intermediate growth in maximal sum-free sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an Abelian groups $G$, denote $\mu(G)$ the size of its largest sum-free subset and $f_{\max}(G)$ the number of maximal sum-free sets in $G$. Confirming a prediction by Liu and Sharifzadeh, we prove that all even-order $G\ne \mathbb{Z}_2^k$ have exponentially fewer maximal sum-free sets than $\mathbb{Z}_2^k$, i.e. $f_{\max}(G) \leq 2^{(1/2-c)\mu(G)}$, where $c &gt; 10^{-64}$.
  We construct an infinite family of Abelian groups $G$ with intermediate growth in the number of maximal sum-free sets, i.e., with $
  2^{(\frac{1}{2}+c)\mu(G)}\leq f_{\max}(G) \leq 3^{(\frac{1}{3}-c)\mu(G)}
  $, where $c=10^{-4}$. This disproves a conjecture of Liu and Sharifzadeh and also answers a question of Hassler and Treglown in the negative.
  Furthermore, we determine for every even-order group $G$, the number of maximal distinct sum-free sets (where a distinct sum is $a+b= c$ with distinct $a,b,c$): it is $ 2^{(1/2+o(1))\mu(G)}$
  with the only exception being $G=\mathbb{Z}_2^k \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3$, when this function is $3^{(1/3+o(1))\mu(G)}$, refuting a conjecture of Hassler and Treglown.
  Our proofs rely on a container theorem due to Green and Ruzsa. Other key ingredient is a sharp upper bound we establish on the number of maximal independent sets in graphs with given matching number, which interpolates between the classical results of Moon and Moser, and Hujter and Tuza. A special case of our bound implies that every $n$-vertex graph with a perfect matching has at most $2^{n/2}$ maximal independent sets, resolving another conjecture of Hassler and Treglown.</description>

      <title>Extremal Bounds on the Properties of Sigma and Albertson Indices for Non-Decreasing Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish bounds on the topological index -- the Sigma index -- focusing on analyzing the upper bound of its maximum value, which is known as $\sigma_{\max}(\mathcal{S}) = \max \{\sigma(\mathscr{G}) \mid \mathscr{G} \in \mathcal{S}\}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a class of graphs. We establish precise lower and upper bounds for the Sigma index by leveraging degree sequences $\mathscr{D} = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, $\mathscr{R} = (t_1, t_2, \dots, t_m)$, and $\mathscr{A} = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r)$.
  The minimum bound for the Albertson index related to the Sigma index bounds incorporates terms such as $\mathrm{irr}(T)$ and $\left\lfloor \frac{n-2}{a_r - t_m} \right\rfloor $. These results, rooted in extremal graph theory, enhance the understanding of topological indices in molecular and network analysis.</description>

      <title>A Stable-Set Bound and Maximal Numbers of Nash Equilibria in Bimatrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12385v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quint and Shubik (1997) conjectured that a non-degenerate n-by-n game has at most 2^n-1 Nash equilibria in mixed strategies. The conjecture is true for n at most 4 but false for n=6 or larger. We answer it positively for the remaining case n=5, which had been open since 1999. The problem can be translated to a combinatorial question about the vertices of a pair of simple n-polytopes with 2n facets. We introduce a novel obstruction based on the index of an equilibrium, which states that equilibrium vertices belong to two equal-sized disjoint stable sets of the graph of the polytope. This bound is verified directly using the known classification of the 159,375 combinatorial types of dual neighborly polytopes in dimension 5 with 10 facets. Non-neighborly polytopes are analyzed with additional combinatorial techniques where the bound is used for their disjoint facets.</description>

      <title>Spirals, Tic-Tac-Toe Partition, and Deep Diagonal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15561v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep diagonal map $T_k$ acts on planar polygons by connecting the $k$-th diagonals and intersecting them successively. The map $T_2$ is the pentagram map, and $T_k$ is a generalization. We study the action of $T_k$ on two subsets of the so-called twisted polygons, which we term type-$\alpha$ and type-$\beta$ $k$-spirals. For $k \geq 2$, $T_{k}$ preserves both types of $k$-spirals. In particular, we show that for $k = 2$ and $k = 3$, both types of $k$-spirals have precompact forward and backward $T_k$-orbits modulo projective transformations. We derive a rational formula for $T_3$, which generalizes the $y$-variables transformation formula of the corresponding quiver mutation by M. Glick and P. Pylyavskyy. We also present four algebraic invariants of $T_3$. These special orbits in the moduli space are partitioned into cells of a $3 \times 3$ tic-tac-toe grid. This establishes the action of $T_k$ on $k$-spirals as a geometric generalization of $T_2$ on convex polygons.</description>

      <title>Graph enumeration for moduli spaces of curves and maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well known bunkbed conjecture about percolation on finite graphs is now resolved; Gladkov, Pak and Zimin, building upon work of Hollom, have constructed a counterexample. We revisit this conjecture and study it in the broader context of the class of random cluster measures. We show that the major partial (positive) results on the bunkbed conjecture can also be proved for all random cluster measures, including the results for complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and the case when $p \uparrow 1$.
  The arboreal gas measure for forests is another limit of the random cluster measure for which we conjecture the inequality to be true and provide proofs in special cases. We identify a setting where the conjecture does hold, that of ``almost spanning tree measures''. A further analysis leads to intriguing correlation inequalities that complement Rayleigh's inequalities for spanning tree measures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study sequences of perfect t-embeddings of a uniformly weighted family of graphs we call generalized tower graphs. We show that the embeddings of these graphs satisfy certain technical assumptions, in particular, the rigidity assumption of Berggren-Nicoletti-Russkikh. As a result, we confirm the convergence of the gradients of the height function fluctuations of these graphs to those of the Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Covering rings by proper ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an associative (not necessarily commutative or unital) ring. A cover by left ideals of $R$ is a collection of proper left ideals whose set-theoretic union equals $R$. If such a cover exists, we define the left ideal covering number $\eta_\ell(R)$ to be the cardinality of a minimal cover, and we also define $R$ to be $\eta_\ell$-elementary if $\eta_\ell(R) &lt; \eta_\ell(R/I)$ for every nonzero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$. Similarly, we can define analogous notions for covers by right ideals $\eta_r(R)$ and two-sided ideals $\eta(R)$. In this paper, we classify all $\eta_\ell$-, $\eta_r$-, and $\eta$-elementary rings, and determine their corresponding ideal covering numbers. Since any ring $R$ that admits a finite cover by left ideals has an $\eta_\ell$-elementary residue ring $R/I$ such that $\eta_\ell(R) = \eta_\ell(R/I)$, this completely characterizes such rings and their ideal covering numbers, and likewise for rings coverable by right or two-sided ideals.</description>

      <title>Direct Paths in the Temporal Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $n$-dimensional random temporal hypercube, i.e., the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph with its edges endowed with i.i.d. continuous random weights. We say that a vertex $w$ is accessible from another vertex $v$ if and only if there is a path from $v$ to $w$ with increasing edge weights. We study accessible "direct" paths from a fixed vertex to its antipodal point and show that as $n \to \infty$, the number of such paths converges in distribution to a mixed Poisson law with mixture given by the product of two independent exponentials with rate $1$. Our proof makes use of the Chen-Stein method, coupling arguments, as well as combinatorial arguments which show that typical pairs of accessible paths have small overlap.</description>

      <title>Exact Lagrangian fillings of twist-spun torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian torus links $\Lambda(k, n-k)$ that are fixed by a Legendrian loop that acts by $2\pi\ell/n$ rotation. Using these rotationally symmetric fillings, we produce fillings of the corresponding Legendrian twist-spun tori. Our construction is combinatorial in nature, relating symmetric weakly separated collections and plabic graphs to symmetric Legendrian weaves via the T-shift procedure of Casals, Le, Sherman-Bennett, and Weng. The main technical ingredient in this process is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of maximal weakly separated collections of $k$-element subsets of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ that are fixed by addition of $\ell$ modulo $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the structure of automorphism groups of finite graphs of bounded Hadwiger number. Our proof includes a structural analysis of finite edge-transitive graphs. In particular, we show that for connected, $K_{h+1}$-minor-free, edge-transitive, twin-free, finite graphs the non-abelian composition factors of the automorphism group have bounded order. We use this to show that the automorphism groups of finite graphs of bounded Hadwiger number are obtained by repeated group extensions using abelian groups, symmetric groups and groups of bounded order.</description>

      <title>On the biases and asymptotics of partitions with finite choices of parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biases in integer partitions have been studied recently. For three disjoint subsets $R,S,I$ of positive integers, let $p_{RSI}(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ with parts from $R\cup S\cup I$ and $p_{R&gt;S,I}(n)$ be the number of such partitions with more parts from $R$ than that from $S$. In this paper, in the case that $R,S,I$ are finite we obtain a concrete formula of the asymptotic ratio of $p_{R&gt;S,I}(n)$ to $p_{RSI}(n)$. We also propose a conjecture in the case that $R,S$ are certain infinite arithmetic progressions.</description>

Abstract: Let A be a graph type and B an equivalence relation on a group $G$. Let $[g]$ be the equivalence class of $g$ with respect to the equivalence relation B. The B superA graph of $G$ is an undirected graph whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $g, h \in G$ are adjacent if $[g] = [h]$ or there exist $x \in [g]$ and $y \in [h]$ such that $x$ and $y$ are adjacent in the A graph of $G$. In this paper, we compute spectrum of equality/conjugacy supercommuting graphs of dihedral/dicyclic groups and show that these graphs are not integral.</description>

Abstract: The Ammann A2 tiling is a simple aperiodically ordered tiling of the plane. We consider the graph derived from this tiling, by treating each corner of each tile as a vertex and each side of each tile as an edge. We present a closed-form formula for the average degree of the graph corresponding to this Ammann A2 tiling.</description>

Abstract: We study a variant of the Erd\H{o}s Matching Problem in random hypergraphs. Let $\mathcal{K}_p(n,k)$ denote the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices where each possible edge is included with probability $p$. We show that when $n\gg k^{2}s$ and $p$ is not too small, with high probability, the maximum number of edges in a sub-hypergraph of $\mathcal{K}_p(n,k)$ with matching number $s$ is obtained by the trivial sub-hypergraphs, i.e. the sub-hypergraph consisting of all edges containing at least one vertex in a fixed set of $s$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Shellability of Higher Independence Complexes of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the shellability of $r$-independence complexes $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$, a generalization of classical independence complexes introduced by Paolini and Salvetti. For a graph $G$, a subset $A \subseteq V(G)$ is $r$-independent if every connected component of the induced subgraph $G[A]$ has at most $r$ vertices. The associated simplicial complex $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ has been the subject of significant interest due to its connections to combinatorial topology and commutative algebra. We address the classification problem for shellable $r$-independence complexes, focusing on block graphs, trees, and related families. Our main results establish sufficient conditions for shellability based on structural graph parameters such as diameter and forbidden subgraphs. Furthermore, we develop constructive techniques for generating shellable complexes through graph operations, including star-clique attachments, clique whiskering, and clique cycle constructions. These results extend and refine earlier work on classical independence complexes and provide a framework for understanding the topological and algebraic properties of higher independence complexes in structured graph families.</description>

      <title>Strong edge-coloring of graphs with maximum edge weight seven</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is an edge-coloring such that any two edges of distance at most two receive distinct colors. The minimum number of colors we need in order to give $G$ a strong edge-coloring is called the strong chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_s'(G)$. The maximum edge weight of $G$ is defined to be $\max\{d(u)+d(v):\ uv\in E(G)\}$. In this paper, using the discharging method, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with maximum edge weight $7$ and maximum average degree less than $\frac{40}{13}$, then $\chi_s'(G)\le 13$. Also, we determine the largest possible maximum average degree of a graph with given maximum edge weight.</description>

      <title>Missing faces of neighborly and nearly neighborly polytopes and spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $(d-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex $\Delta$ and $1\leq i\leq d$, let $f_{i-1}$ be the number of $(i-1)$-faces of $\Delta$ and $m_i$ be the number of missing $i$-faces of $\Delta$. In the nineties, Kalai asked for a characterization of the $m$-numbers of simplicial polytopes and spheres -- a problem that remains wide open to this day. Here, we study the $m$-numbers of nearly neighborly and neighborly polytopes and spheres. Specifically, for $d\geq 4$, we obtain a lower bound on $m_{\lfloor d/2\rfloor}$ in terms of $f_0$ and $f_{\lfloor d/2\rfloor-1}$ in the class of all $(\lfloor d/2\rfloor-1)$-neighborly $(d-1)$-spheres. For neighborly spheres, we (almost) characterize the $m$-numbers of $2$-neighborly $4$-spheres, and we show that, for all odd values of $k$, there exists an infinite family of neighborly simplicial $2k$-spheres with $m_{k+1}=0$. Along the way, we provide a simple numerical condition based on the $m$-numbers that allows to establish non-polytopality of some neighborly odd-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <title>Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oriented line graph, introduced by Kotani and Sunada (2000), is closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix (1989). It is known that for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the oriented line graph $\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the Ihara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomials of the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\vec{L}(G)$ and the skew-symmetric adjacency matrix (and Hermitian adjacency matrix) of $\vec{L}(G)$ for $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d\geq 3$.
  A locally bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is a mapping $\psi\colon V(G)\to V(H)$ such that for every vertex $v$ of $G$, the restriction of $\psi$ to the neighborhood $N_G(v)$ is a bijection (resp. injection) from $N_G(v)$ to $N_H(\psi(v))$ (Fiala and Kratochv\'il, 2008). An out-neighborhood bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a directed graph $\vec{G}$ to a directed graph $\vec{H}$ is a mapping $\psi\colon V(\vec{G})\to V(\vec{H})$ such that for every vertex $v$ of $\vec{G}$, the restriction of $\psi$ to the out-neighborhood $N_{\vec{G}}^+(v)$ is a bijection (resp. injection) from $N_{\vec{G}}^+(v)$ to $N_{\vec{H}}^+(\psi(v))$ (Antony and Shalu, 2025). We prove that the existence of a locally bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a graph $G$ of minimum degree at least 3 to a graph $H$ is equivalent to the existence of an out-neighborhood bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from $\vec{L}(G)$ to $\vec{L}(H)$. We also prove some results on the coloring variants distance-two coloring and star coloring.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and local weak convergence of sparse random uniform hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of local weak convergence, or Benjamini--Schramm convergence, was introduced by Benjamini and Schramm. The local weak limit of sparse Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs is the Galton--Watson measure with Poisson offspring almost surely. Recently, Adhikari, Kumar, and Saha showed that the line graph of sparse Linial--Meshulam complexes converges to the $d$-block Galton--Watson measure. We study a unified model: weighted line graphs of sparse $k$-uniform random hypergraphs on $n$ vertices. Let $H(n,k,p)$ be the $k$-uniform random hypergraph where each $k$-subset of $[n]$ is included as a hyperedge independently with probability $p$. For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ and $1\le r\le k-1$, define the $r$-set weighted line graph $G_r(H)=(\mathcal V_r,\mathcal E_r,w_H)$ by $$ \mathcal V_r=\bigl[\tbinom{n}{r}\bigr],\quad \mathcal E_r=\bigl\{\{\tau_1,\tau_2\}:\tau_1,\tau_2\in\mathcal V_r,\ \exists e\in E\text{ s.t. }\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\bigr\}, $$ with weight $w_H(\{\tau_1,\tau_2\})=\bigl|\{e\in E:\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\}\bigr|$. In particular, $G_1(H_n)$ generalizes Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs and $G_{k-1}(H_n)$ is the line graph of the Linial--Meshulam complex. We show that if $\tbinom{n-r}{k-r}\to \lambda$ as $n\to\infty$, then $G_r(H_n)$ converges locally to the $(\tbinom{k}{r}-1)$-block Galton--Watson measure with $\operatorname{Poisson}(\lambda)$ offspring almost surely. As a consequence, we obtain the limiting spectral distribution of the adjacency matrices of $G_r(H_n)$.</description>

Abstract: For the finite ordered sets $A, D$, write $A^D$ for the ordered set of isotone maps $D \to A$ with the pointwise order. It was proved in earlier work that the order structure of $A^A$ determines~$A$ up to isomorphism. In this note we extend the result to higher function ordered sets such as $A^{(A^A)}$ and $(A^A)^A$. Our main theorem shows that the structure of $A^D$ determines~$A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fighting fish is a combinatorial configuration introduced by Duchi et al. as a new model of branching surfaces that generalizes directed convex polyominoes. We come up with an alternative construction of fighting fish, using a tree structure built on the so-called stem cells of fighting fish. From this perspective, we establish a bijection between ternary trees and fighting fish with a marked strip of cells, which specializes to a direct bijection between left ternary trees and fighting fish. Using these results, we obtain a combinatorial enumeration of the fighting fish of size $n$ by establishing a $(n+1)$-to-2 bijection with the ternary trees having $n$ nodes. We present some additional enumerative results including that the fighting fish with a marked tail and the horizontally symmetric fighting fish are equinumerous with the ordered pairs of ternary trees having a total of a prescribed number of nodes.</description>

Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $4d$ $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) half Seiberg--Witten spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hslash$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Do{\l}{\k{e}}ga--Osuga.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of subshifts and infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the complexity functions of subshifts up to asymptotic equivalence. The complexity function of every aperiodic function is non-decreasing, submultiplicative and grows at least linearly. We prove that conversely, every function satisfying these conditions is asymptotically equivalent to the complexity function of a recurrent subshift, equivalently, a recurrent infinite word. Our construction is explicit, algorithmic in nature and is philosophically based on constructing certain 'Cantor sets of integers', whose 'gaps' correspond to blocks of zeros. We also prove that every non-decreasing submultiplicative function is asymptotically equivalent, up a linear error term, to the complexity function of a minimal subshift.</description>

      <title>Divisibility relation between the number of certain surjective group and ring homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we identify the existence of a divisibility relationship between the number of ring homomorphisms and surjective group homomorphisms. We demonstrate that for finite cyclic structures, the number of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a divisor of the number of surjective group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $n$ is not of the form $2 \cdot \alpha$, where each prime factor $p$ of $\alpha$ satisfies $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. We further extend this result for finite abelian structures.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of chaos and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is a generalization of the propagation of chaos. The weight adaptation in the SDEs makes the classical approach of using a static probability space as the continuum limit for the agent labels inadequate. We address this by introducing a label space endowed with a filtration that captures the stochasticity. While this yields a well-posed McKean-Vlasov SDE, its limit is not easily described by a Vlasov-type PDE. This difficulty, in turn, motivates the introduction of a unified metric that naturally combines the Wasserstein distance for states and the cut norm for weights. In this metric space, we establish the convergence of finite systems to their continuum limit. This result, analogous to the classical convergence of empirical measures, is a subtle consequence of a deep result from dense graph theory, namely the Sampling Lemma.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of several of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are `closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc.) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Symplectic configurations: a homological and computer-aided approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulated a homological and computer-aided approach to study certain unions of symplectic surfaces, called symplectic configurations, in a rational $4$-manifold $X=CP^2\# N\overline{CP^2}$. We addressed several fundamental theoretical questions, and also as a technical device, developed a symplectic analog of the so-called quadratic Cremona transformations in complex algebraic geometry. As an application, we gave a new proof that a certain line arrangement in $CP^2$, called Fano planes, does not exist in the symplectic category. The nonexistence of Fano planes in the holomorphic category was due to Hirzebruch, and in the topological category, it was first proved by Ruberman and Starkston. Our proof in the symplectic category is independent to both.</description>

      <title>Rees algebras of complementary edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Rees algebras of squarefree monomial ideals $I \subset S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ generated in degree $n-2$, where $K$ is a field. Every such ideal arises as the complementary edge ideal $I_c(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the defining equations of the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ in terms of the combinatorics of $G$. If $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph whose unique induced cycle has length $3$ or $4$, we prove that $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ is Koszul. We also determine the asymptotic depth of the powers of $I_c(G)$, proving that $\lim_{k \to \infty}\text{depth}\, S/I_c(G)^k=b(G)$, where $b(G)$ is the number of bipartite connected components of $G$. Finally, we show that the index of depth stability of $I_c(G)$ is at most $n-2$, and equality holds when $G$ is a path graph.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.</description>
