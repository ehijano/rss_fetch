      <title>AI-Governed Agent Architecture for Web-Trustworthy Tokenization of Alternative Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges, from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security, and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.</description>

      <title>AI-Hybrid TRNG: Kernel-Based Deep Learning for Near-Uniform Entropy Harvesting from Physical Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences. Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic simulations, and server applications that need randomness.</description>

      <title>Plug. Play. Persist. Inside a Ready-to-Go Havoc C2 Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This analysis focuses on a single Azure-hosted Virtual Machine at 52.230.23.114 that the adversary converted into an all-in-one delivery, staging and Command-and-Control node. The host advertises an out-of-date Apache 2.4.52 instance whose open directory exposes phishing lures, PowerShell loaders, Reflective Shell-Code, compiled Havoc Demon implants and a toolbox of lateral-movement binaries; the same server also answers on 8443/80 for encrypted beacon traffic. The web tier is riddled with publicly documented critical vulnerabilities, that would have allowed initial code-execution had the attackers not already owned the device.
  Initial access is delivered through an HTML file that, once de-obfuscated, perfectly mimics Google Unusual sign-in attempt notification and funnels victims toward credential collection. A PowerShell command follows: it disables AMSI in-memory, downloads a Base64-encoded stub, allocates RWX pages and starts the shell-code without ever touching disk. That stub reconstructs a DLL in memory using the Reflective-Loader technique and hands control to Havoc Demon implant. Every Demon variant-32- and 64-bit alike-talks to the same backend, resolves Windows APIs with hashed look-ups, and hides its activity behind indirect syscalls.
  Runtime telemetry shows interests in registry under Image File Execution Options, deliberate queries to Software Restriction Policy keys, and heavy use of Crypto DLLs to protect payloads and C2 traffic. The attacker toolkit further contains Chisel, PsExec, Doppelganger and Whisker, some of them re-compiled under user directories that leak the developer personas tonzking123 and thobt. Collectively the findings paint a picture of a technically adept actor who values rapid re-tooling over deep operational security, leaning on Havoc modularity and on legitimate cloud services to blend malicious flows into ordinary enterprise traffic.</description>

      <title>Addressing malware family concept drift with triplet autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly vital in cybersecurity, especially in malware detection. However, concept drift, where the characteristics of malware change over time, poses a challenge for maintaining the efficacy of these detection systems. Concept drift can occur in two forms: the emergence of entirely new malware families and the evolution of existing ones. This paper proposes an innovative method to address the former, focusing on effectively identifying new malware families. Our approach leverages a supervised autoencoder combined with triplet loss to differentiate between known and new malware families. We create clear and robust clusters that enhance the accuracy and resilience of malware family classification by utilizing this metric learning technique and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is validated using an Android malware dataset and a Windows portable executable (PE) malware dataset, showcasing its capability to sustain model performance within the dynamic landscape of emerging malware threats. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting new malware families, offering a reliable solution for ongoing cybersecurity challenges.</description>

      <title>Find a Scapegoat: Poisoning Membership Inference Attack and Defense to Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global machine learning model with coordination from a central server, without needing to share their raw data. This approach is particularly appealing in the era of privacy regulations like the GDPR, leading many prominent companies to adopt it. However, FL's distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients, controlled by an attacker, send harmful data to compromise the model. Most existing poisoning attacks in FL aim to degrade the model's integrity, such as reducing its accuracy, with limited attention to privacy concerns from these attacks. In this study, we introduce FedPoisonMIA, a novel poisoning membership inference attack targeting FL. FedPoisonMIA involves malicious clients crafting local model updates to infer membership information. Additionally, we propose a robust defense mechanism to mitigate the impact of FedPoisonMIA attacks. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, while our defense approach reduces its impact to a degree.</description>

      <title>Cyber Attacks Detection, Prevention, and Source Localization in Digital Substation Communication using Hybrid Statistical-Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.</description>

      <title>BadViM: Backdoor Attack against Vision Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture, especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop, PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>The Secrets Must Not Flow: Scaling Security Verification to Large Codebases (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing program verifiers can prove advanced properties about security protocol implementations, but are difficult to scale to large codebases because of the manual effort required. We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon* that addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol implementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split allows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the security-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the verification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot invalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses achieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations within the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data (such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have proved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application to perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual verification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two case studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a large (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol for which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a Core of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in less than three person months.</description>

      <title>Integrating Network and Attack Graphs for Service-Centric Impact Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for modelling, visualising, and analysing cyber threats, attack paths, as well as their impact on user services in enterprise or infrastructure networks of digital devices and services they provide. Using probabilistic methods to track the propagation of an attack through attack graphs, via the service or application layers, and on physical communication networks, our model enables us to analyse cyber attacks at different levels of detail. Understanding the propagation of an attack within a service among microservices and its spread between different services or application servers could help detect and mitigate it early. We demonstrate that this network-based influence spreading modelling approach enables the evaluation of diverse attack scenarios and the development of protection and mitigation measures, taking into account the criticality of services from the user's perspective. This methodology could also aid security specialists and system administrators in making well-informed decisions regarding risk mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Safe Low Bandwidth SPV: A Formal Treatment of Simplified Payment Verification Protocols and Security Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a complete formal specification, protocol description, and mathematical proof structure for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as originally defined in the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008}. In stark contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles, grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding non-validating clients.</description>

      <title>A Technique for the Detection of PDF Tampering or Forgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tampering or forgery of digital documents has become widespread, most commonly through altering images without any malicious intent such as enhancing the overall appearance of the image. However, there are occasions when tampering of digital documents can have negative consequences, such as financial fraud and reputational damage. Tampering can occur through altering a digital document's text or editing an image's pixels. Many techniques have been developed to detect whether changes have been made to a document. Most of these techniques rely on generating hashes or watermarking the document. These techniques, however, have limitations in that they cannot detect alterations to portable document format (PDF) signatures or other non-visual aspects, such as metadata. This paper presents a new technique that can be used to detect tampering within a PDF document by utilizing the PDF document's file page objects. The technique employs a prototype that can detect changes to a PDF document, such as changes made to the text, images, or metadata of the said file.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Efficacy of LLMs for Penetration-Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical examination of the surprising efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in penetration testing. The paper thoroughly reviews the evolution of LLMs and their rapidly expanding capabilities which render them increasingly suitable for complex penetration testing operations. It systematically details the historical adoption of LLMs in both academic research and industry, showcasing their application across various offensive security tasks and covering broader phases of the cyber kill chain. Crucially, the analysis also extends to the observed adoption of LLMs by malicious actors, underscoring the inherent dual-use challenge of this technology within the security landscape.
  The unexpected effectiveness of LLMs in this context is elucidated by several key factors: the strong alignment between penetration testing's reliance on pattern-matching and LLMs' core strengths, their inherent capacity to manage uncertainty in dynamic environments, and cost-effective access to competent pre-trained models through LLM providers.
  The current landscape of LLM-aided penetration testing is categorized into interactive 'vibe-hacking' and the emergence of fully autonomous systems. The paper identifies and discusses significant obstacles impeding wider adoption and safe deployment. These include critical issues concerning model reliability and stability, paramount safety and security concerns, substantial monetary and ecological costs, implications for privacy and digital sovereignty, complex questions of accountability, and profound ethical dilemmas. This comprehensive review and analysis provides a foundation for discussion on future research directions and the development of robust safeguards at the intersection of AI and security.</description>

      <title>Stealtooth: Breaking Bluetooth Security Abusing Silent Automatic Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth is a pervasive wireless communication technology used by billions of devices for short-range connectivity. The security of Bluetooth relies on the pairing process, where devices establish shared long-term keys for secure communications. However, many commercial Bluetooth devices implement automatic pairing functions to improve user convenience, creating a previously unexplored attack surface.
  We present Stealtooth, a novel attack that abuses unknown vulnerabilities in the automatic pairing functions in commercial Bluetooth devices to achieve completely silent device link key overwriting. The Stealtooth attack leverages the fact that Bluetooth audio devices automatically transition to pairing mode under specific conditions, enabling attackers to hijack pairing processes without user awareness or specialized tools. We also extend the attack into the MitM Stealtooth attack, combining automatic pairing abuse with power-saving mode techniques to enable man-in-the-middle attacks.
  We evaluate the attacks against 10 commercial Bluetooth devices from major manufacturers, demonstrating widespread vulnerabilities across diverse device types and manufacturers. Our practical implementation requires only commodity hardware and open-source software, highlighting the low barrier to entry for attackers.
  We propose defenses both device and protocol levels, including enhanced user notifications and standardized automatic pairing guidelines. Our findings reveal a critical tension between security and usability, showing that current automatic pairing implementations create systematic vulnerabilities. We responsibly disclosed our findings to affected vendors, with several already releasing patches.</description>

      <title>The Age of Sensorial Zero Trust: Why We Can No Longer Trust Our Senses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a world where deepfakes and cloned voices are emerging as sophisticated attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators, cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be implicitly trusted without verification. Leaders are called to foster a culture of methodological skepticism to protect organizational integrity in this new threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Deciding When Not to Decide: Indeterminacy-Aware Intrusion Detection with NeutroSENSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62) than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy, human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer with Adversarial Indicator Token against Adversarial Attacks in Radio Signal Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism. We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT, influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and basic iterative method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first quantum authentication scheme for continuous-variable states. Our scheme is based on trap states, and is an adaptation of a discrete-variable scheme by Broadbent et al. (arXiv:1211.1080), but with more freedom in choosing the number of traps. We provide a security proof, mostly following the approach of Broadbent and Wainewright (arXiv:1607.03075). As a necessary ingredient for the proof we derive the continuous-variable analogue of the Pauli Twirl.</description>

      <title>PPFL-RDSN: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning-based Residual Dense Spatial Networks for Encrypted Lossy Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality images from low-resolution inputs using Residual Dense Spatial Networks (RDSNs) is crucial yet challenging, particularly in collaborative scenarios where centralized training poses significant privacy risks, including data leakage and inference attacks, as well as high computational costs. We propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning-based RDSN (PPFL-RDSN) framework specifically tailored for lossy image reconstruction. PPFL-RDSN integrates Federated Learning (FL), local differential privacy, and robust model watermarking techniques, ensuring data remains secure on local devices, safeguarding sensitive information, and maintaining model authenticity without revealing underlying data. Empirical evaluations show that PPFL-RDSN achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art centralized methods while reducing computational burdens, and effectively mitigates security and privacy vulnerabilities, making it a practical solution for secure and privacy-preserving collaborative computer vision applications.</description>

      <title>When Kids Mode Isn't For Kids: Investigating TikTok's "Under 13 Experience"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TikTok, the social media platform that is popular among children and adolescents, offers a more restrictive "Under 13 Experience" exclusively for young users in the US, also known as TikTok's "Kids Mode". While prior research has studied various aspects of TikTok's regular mode, including privacy and personalization, TikTok's Kids Mode remains understudied, and there is a lack of transparency regarding its content curation and its safety and privacy protections for children. In this paper, (i) we propose an auditing methodology to comprehensively investigate TikTok's Kids Mode and (ii) we apply it to characterize the platform's content curation and determine the prevalence of child-directed content, based on regulations in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We find that 83% of videos observed on the "For You" page in Kids Mode are actually not child-directed, and even inappropriate content was found. The platform also lacks critical features, namely parental controls and accessibility settings. Our findings have important design and regulatory implications, as children may be incentivized to use TikTok's regular mode instead of Kids Mode, where they are known to be exposed to further safety and privacy risks.</description>

      <title>Presto: Hardware Acceleration of Ciphers for Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) combines symmetric key and homomorphic encryption to reduce ciphertext expansion crucial in client-server deployments of HE. Special symmetric ciphers, amenable to efficient HE evaluation, have been developed. Their client-side deployment calls for performant and energy-efficient implementation, and in this paper we develop and evaluate hardware accelerators for the two known CKKS-targeting HHE ciphers, HERA and Rubato.
  We design vectorized and overlapped functional modules. The design exploits transposition-invariance property of the MixColumns and MixRows function and alternates the order of intermediate state to eliminate bubbles in stream key generation, improving latency and throughput. We decouple the RNG and key computation phases to hide the latency of RNG and to reduce the critical path in FIFOs, achieving higher operating frequency.
  We implement the accelerator on an AMD Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA. Both Rubato and HERA achieve a 6x improvement in throughput compared to the software implementation. In terms of latency, Rubato achieves a 5x reduction, while HERA achieves a 3x reduction. Additionally, our hardware implementations reduce energy consumption by 75x for Rubato and 47x for HERA compared to their software implementation.</description>

      <title>Gaze3P: Gaze-Based Prediction of User-Perceived Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy is a highly subjective concept and perceived variably by different individuals. Previous research on quantifying user-perceived privacy has primarily relied on questionnaires. Furthermore, applying user-perceived privacy to optimise the parameters of privacy-preserving techniques (PPT) remains insufficiently explored. To address these limitations, we introduce Gaze3P -- the first dataset specifically designed to facilitate systematic investigations into user-perceived privacy. Our dataset comprises gaze data from 100 participants and 1,000 stimuli, encompassing a range of private and safe attributes. With Gaze3P, we train a machine learning model to implicitly and dynamically predict perceived privacy from human eye gaze. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that the resulting models achieve high accuracy. Finally, we illustrate how predicted privacy can be used to optimise the parameters of differentially private mechanisms, thereby enhancing their alignment with user expectations.</description>

      <title>Cage-Based Deformation for Transferable and Undefendable Point Cloud Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on point clouds often impose strict geometric constraints to preserve plausibility; however, such constraints inherently limit transferability and undefendability. While deformation offers an alternative, existing unstructured approaches may introduce unnatural distortions, making adversarial point clouds conspicuous and undermining their plausibility. In this paper, we propose CageAttack, a cage-based deformation framework that produces natural adversarial point clouds. It first constructs a cage around the target object, providing a structured basis for smooth, natural-looking deformation. Perturbations are then applied to the cage vertices, which seamlessly propagate to the point cloud, ensuring that the resulting deformations remain intrinsic to the object and preserve plausibility. Extensive experiments on seven 3D deep neural network classifiers across three datasets show that CageAttack achieves a superior balance among transferability, undefendability, and plausibility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be made public upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>SafeMobile: Chain-level Jailbreak Detection and Automated Evaluation for Multimodal Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.</description>

      <title>How Resilient is QUIC to Security and Privacy Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QUIC has rapidly evolved into a cornerstone transport protocol for secure, low-latency communications, yet its deployment continues to expose critical security and privacy vulnerabilities, particularly during connection establishment phases and via traffic analysis. This paper systematically revisits a comprehensive set of attacks on QUIC and emerging privacy threats. Building upon these observations, we critically analyze recent IETF mitigation efforts, including TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) and MASQUE. We analyze how these mechanisms enhance privacy while introducing new operational risks, particularly under adversarial load. Additionally, we discuss emerging challenges posed by post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) handshakes, including handshake expansion and metadata leakage risks. Our analysis highlights ongoing gaps between theoretical defenses and practical deployments, and proposes new research directions focused on adaptive privacy mechanisms. Building on these insights, we propose future directions to ensure long-term security of QUIC and aim to guide its evolution as a robust, privacy-preserving, and resilient transport foundation for the next-generation Internet.</description>

      <title>A system capable of verifiably and privately screening global DNA synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Printing custom DNA sequences is essential to scientific and biomedical research, but the technology can be used to manufacture plagues as well as cures. Just as ink printers recognize and reject attempts to counterfeit money, DNA synthesizers and assemblers should deny unauthorized requests to make viral DNA that could be misused. There are three complications. First, we don't need to quickly update printers to deal with newly discovered currencies, whereas we regularly learn of new potential pandemic viruses and other biological threats. Second, convincing counterfeit bills can't be printed in small pieces and taped together, while preventing the distributed synthesis and subsequent re-assembly of controlled sequences will require tracking which DNA fragments have been ordered across all providers and benchtop devices while protecting legitimate customer privacy. Finally, counterfeiting can at worst undermine faith in currency, whereas unauthorized DNA synthesis could be used to deliberately cause pandemics. Here we describe SecureDNA, a free, privacy-preserving, and fully automated system capable of verifiably screening all DNA synthesis orders of 30+ nucleotides against an up-to-date database of controlled sequences, and its operational performance and specificity when applied to 67 million nucleotides of DNA synthesized by providers in the United States, Europe, and China.</description>

      <title>Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With over 3 billion users globally, mobile instant messaging apps have become indispensable for both personal and professional communication. Besides plain messaging, many services implement additional features such as delivery and read receipts informing a user when a message has successfully reached its target. This paper highlights that delivery receipts can pose significant privacy risks to users. We use specifically crafted messages that trigger delivery receipts allowing any user to be pinged without their knowledge or consent. By using this technique at high frequency, we demonstrate how an attacker could extract private information such as the online and activity status of a victim, e.g., screen on/off. Moreover, we can infer the number of currently active user devices and their operating system, as well as launch resource exhaustion attacks, such as draining a user's battery or data allowance, all without generating any notification on the target side. Due to the widespread adoption of vulnerable messengers (WhatsApp and Signal) and the fact that any user can be targeted simply by knowing their phone number, we argue for a design change to address this issue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a malicious software sample, detailing its architecture, behavioral characteristics, and underlying intent. Through static and dynamic examination, the malware core functionalities, including persistence mechanisms, command-and-control communication, and data exfiltration routines, are identified and its supporting infrastructure is mapped. By correlating observed indicators of compromise with known techniques, tactics, and procedures, this analysis situates the sample within the broader context of contemporary threat campaigns and infers the capabilities and motivations of its likely threat actor.
  Building on these findings, actionable threat intelligence is provided to support proactive defenses. Threat hunting teams receive precise detection hypotheses for uncovering latent adversarial presence, while monitoring systems can refine alert logic to detect anomalous activity in real time. Finally, the report discusses how this structured intelligence enhances predictive risk assessments, informs vulnerability prioritization, and strengthens organizational resilience against advanced persistent threats. By integrating detailed technical insights with strategic threat landscape mapping, this malware analysis report not only reconstructs past adversary actions but also establishes a robust foundation for anticipating and mitigating future attacks.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Identity-Transformation Approach in OIDC-Compatible Privacy-Preserving SSO Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenID Connect (OIDC) enables a user with commercial-off-the-shelf browsers to log into multiple websites, called relying parties (RPs), by her username and credential set up in another trusted web system, called the identity provider (IdP). Identity transformations are proposed in UppreSSO to provide OIDC-compatible SSO services, preventing both IdP-based login tracing and RP-based identity linkage. While security and privacy of SSO services in UppreSSO have been proved, several essential issues of this identity-transformation approach are not well studied. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the approach as below. Firstly, several suggestions for the efficient integration of identity transformations in OIDC-compatible SSO are explained. Then, we uncover the relationship between identity-transformations in SSO and oblivious pseudo-random functions (OPRFs), and present two variations of the properties required for SSO security as well as the privacy requirements, to analyze existing OPRF protocols. Finally, new identity transformations different from those designed in UppreSSO, are constructed based on OPRFs, satisfying different variations of SSO security requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to uncover the relationship between identity transformations in OIDC-compatible privacy-preserving SSO services and OPRFs, and prove the SSO-related properties (i.e., key-identifier freeness, RP designation and user identification) of OPRF protocols, in addition to the basic properties of correctness, obliviousness and pseudo-randomness.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Azure RBAC Wildcard Overreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azure RBAC leverages wildcard permissions to simplify policy authoring, but this abstraction often obscures the actual set of allowed operations and undermines least-privilege guarantees. We introduce Belshazaar, a two-stage framework that targets both the effective permission set problem and the evaluation of wildcards permissions spread. First, we formalize Azure action syntax via a context free grammar and implement a compiler that expands any wildcard into its explicit action set. Second, we define an ultrametric diameter metric to quantify semantic overreach in wildcard scenarios. Applied to Microsoft s official catalog of 15481 actions, Belshazaar reveals that about 50 percent of actions admit a cross Resource Provider reach when associated with non obvious wildcards, and that effective permissions sets are effectively computable. These findings demonstrate that wildcard patterns can introduce substantial privilege bloat, and that our approach offers a scalable, semantics driven path toward tighter, least-privilege RBAC policies in Azure environments.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving LLM Interaction with Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.</description>

      <title>A Survey of LLM-Driven AI Agent Communication: Protocols, Security Risks, and Defense Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Large-Language-Model-driven AI agents have exhibited unprecedented intelligence and adaptability, and are rapidly changing human production and life. Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new round of evolution. They no longer act as an isolated island like LLMs. Instead, they start to communicate with diverse external entities, such as other agents and tools, to perform more complex tasks collectively. Under this trend, agent communication is regarded as a foundational pillar of the future AI ecosystem, and many organizations have intensively begun to design related communication protocols (e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the recent few months. However, this new field exposes significant security hazards, which can cause severe damage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers quickly figure out this promising topic and benefit the future agent communication development, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of agent communication security. More precisely, we first present a clear definition of agent communication and categorize the entire lifecycle of agent communication into three stages: user-agent interaction, agent-agent communication, and agent-environment communication. Next, for each communication phase, we dissect related protocols and analyze the security risks according to the communication characteristics. Then, we summarize and outlook on the possible defense countermeasures for each risk. In addition, we conduct experiments using MCP and A2A to help readers better understand the novel vulnerabilities brought by agent communication. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions in this promising research field.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Truth of Global Model: A Generic Solution to Defend Against Byzantine and Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, the federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such \textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate contributions from these underrepresented datasets.
  In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem in $2$-dimensional Lattices, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently solving the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) in two-dimensional lattices holds practical significance in cryptography and computational geometry. While simpler than its high-dimensional counterpart, two-dimensional SVP motivates scalable solutions for high-dimensional lattices and benefits applications like sequence cipher cryptanalysis involving large integers. In this work, we first propose a novel definition of reduced bases and develop an efficient adaptive lattice reduction algorithm \textbf{CrossEuc} that strategically applies the Euclidean algorithm across dimensions. Building on this framework, we introduce \textbf{HVec}, a vectorized generalization of the Half-GCD algorithm originally defined for integers, which can efficiently halve the bit-length of two vectors and may have independent interest. By iteratively invoking \textbf{HVec}, our optimized algorithm \textbf{HVecSBP} achieves a reduced basis in $O(\log n M(n) )$ time for arbitrary input bases with bit-length $n$, where $M(n)$ denotes the cost of multiplying two $n$-bit integers. Compared to existing algorithms, our design is applicable to general forms of input lattices, eliminating the cost of pre-converting input bases to Hermite Normal Form (HNF). The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that for the input lattice bases in HNF, the optimized algorithm \textbf{HVecSBP} achieves at least a $13.5\times$ efficiency improvement compared to existing methods. For general-form input lattice bases, converting them to HNF before applying \textbf{HVecSBP} offers only marginal advantages in extreme cases where the two basis vectors are nearly degenerate. However, as the linear dependency between input basis vectors decreases, directly employing \textbf{HVecSBP} yields increasingly significant efficiency gains, outperforming hybrid approaches that rely on prior \textbf{HNF} conversion.</description>

      <title>SKALD: Scalable K-Anonymisation for Large Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data privacy and anonymisation are critical concerns in today's data-driven society, particularly when handling personal and sensitive user data. Regulatory frameworks worldwide recommend privacy-preserving protocols such as k-anonymisation to de-identify releases of tabular data. Available hardware resources provide an upper bound on the maximum size of dataset that can be processed at a time. Large datasets with sizes exceeding this upper bound must be broken up into smaller data chunks for processing. In these cases, standard k-anonymisation tools such as ARX can only operate on a per-chunk basis. This paper proposes SKALD, a novel algorithm for performing k-anonymisation on large datasets with limited RAM. Our SKALD algorithm offers multi-fold performance improvement over standard k-anonymisation methods by extracting and combining sufficient statistics from each chunk during processing to ensure successful k-anonymisation while providing better utility.</description>

      <title>Defensive Adversarial CAPTCHA: A Semantics-Driven Framework for Natural Adversarial Example Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) schemes are increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on the original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit their applicability in scenarios where no initial input images are available. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (DAC), a novel framework that generates high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified semantics information. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), DAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and enriches the semantic information. To address various application scenarios, we examine the white-box targeted attack scenario and the black box untargeted attack scenario. For target attacks, we introduce two latent noise variables that are alternately guided in the diffusion step to achieve robust inversion. The synergy between gradient guidance and latent variable optimization achieved in this way ensures that the generated adversarial examples not only accurately align with the target conditions but also achieve optimal performance in terms of distributional consistency and attack effectiveness. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-DAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show that the defensive adversarial CAPTCHA generated by BP-DAC is able to defend against most of the unknown models, and the generated CAPTCHA is indistinguishable to both humans and DNNs.</description>
