      <title>Generalized Entropy Theory Investigation of the Relatively High Segmental Fragility of Many Glass-Forming Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the generalized entropy theory (GET) of glass formation to address one of the most singular and least understood properties of polymer glass-forming liquids in comparison to atomic and small molecule liquids -- the often relatively high fragility of the polymer dynamics on a segmental scale, $m_s$. We first analyze the relation between $m_s$ and the ratio, $S_c^*/ S_c(T_{\mathrm{g}})$. We find that an apparently general nonlinear relation between $m_s$ and $S_c^*/ S_c(T_{\mathrm{g}})$ holds to a good approximation for a large class of polymer models, $m_s \approx 7.9 \exp [0.6S_c^*/ S_c(T_{\mathrm{g}})]$. The predicted ranges of $m_s$ and $S_c^*/ S_c(T_{\mathrm{g}})$ are consistent with experimental estimates for high molecular-mass polymer, oligomeric, small molecule, and atomic glass-forming liquids. In particular, relatively high values of $m_s$ are found for polymers having complex monomer structures and significant chain stiffness. The variation of $m_s$ with molecular mass, chain stiffness, and intermolecular interaction strength can be traced to the variation of $S_c^*$, which is shown to provide a measure of packing frustration defined in terms of the dimensionless thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility. The often relatively high fragility and large extent of cooperative motion are found in the GET to derive from the often relatively large packing frustration in this class of polymer glass-forming liquids. Finally, we also develop a tentative model of the ``dynamical segmental relaxation time'' based on the GET, in which the polymers on a coarse-grained scale are modeled as strings of structureless ``beads'', as assumed in the Rouse and reptation models of polymer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two interfacial stress formulations constructed from the diffuse interface free energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress in one-component fluids and the former represents the stress related to the osmotic pressure.</description>

      <title>An active hydroelastic liquid crystal phase of a fluttering ferroelectric nematic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization flutter, produced by an applied AC electric field drives an equilibrium ferroelectric nematic ($\mathrm{N_F}$) liquid crystal (LC) through a transition into a dissipative active ferroelectric nematic state exhibiting strong elasto-hydrodynamic intermolecular interaction. In such a fluttering ferroelectric, the typical equilibrium $\mathrm{N_F}$ textural features adopted to reduce electrostatic energy, such as preferences for director bend, and alignment of polarization parallel to LC/air interfaces, are overcome, giving way to nonequilibrium conjugate structures in which director splay, and alignment of polarization normal to $\mathrm{N_F}$/air interfaces are preferred. Viewing the latter textures as those of an active nematic phase reveals that self-organization to reduce effective viscosity and resulting dissipation generates a flow-driven apparent nematic elasticity and interface structuring that dominates equilibrium LC elastic and surface forces.</description>

      <title>Transient Negative Capacitance in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient negative capacitance (NC) of solid ferroelectric materials used in field effect transistors can reduce the power dissipation of electronics. Here we show that similar negative capacitance appears in the recently discovered fluid ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (FNLC) films while switching their ferroelectric polarization. Instead of sidewise motion of domains with opposite direction of polarization of ferroelectric crystals, in FNLCs the polarization vector that at zero field aligns parallel to the substrates, rotates toward the applied electric field. In spite of that difference, the observed switching time per unit electric field values are comparable. Although current FNLCs have much larger electric conductivity than of ferroelectric crystals, they have several advantages: they are organic, lightweight, can be prepared and operated at ambient temperature, the direction of the polarization can be set by simple surface alignment, and they require much less electric field for switching of the polarization. These properties make FNLCs attractive to test them in in flexible organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) devices.</description>

      <title>The irreversible thermodynamics of curved lipid membranes II: Permeability and osmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory that combines the framework of irreversible thermodynamics with modified integral theorems to model arbitrarily curved and deforming membranes immersed in bulk fluid solutions. We study the coupling between the mechanics and permeability of a viscous and elastically-bendable membrane, and a multi-component bulk fluid solution. An equation for the internal entropy production for irreversibilities at the membrane is derived, determining the generalized thermodynamic forces and fluxes, from which we identify the deviatoric stress as a novel driving force for permeability. A complete set of equations of motion, constitutive laws, and boundary conditions to model the lipid membrane and bulk fluid system are provided.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Einstein Relation for Markovian Friction Coefficients from Molecular Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized Einstein relation for the friction coefficients associated with an underlying memory kernel in terms of observable time correlation functions. There is considerable freedom in the correlations involved, and this allows the expression to be tailored to the particular system to achieve numerical stability. We demonstrate this by recovering the site-specific friction coefficients from trajectories of a freely diffusing model trimer, and we show that the accuracy is greatly improved over established Volterra inversion methods for kernel extraction.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Pattern Formation in Geological Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geological materials are often seen as the antithesis of soft; rocks are hard. However, during the formation of minerals and rocks, all the systems we shall discuss, indeed geological materials in general, pass through a stage where they are soft. This occurs either because they are at a high temperature -- igneous or metamorphic rock -- or because they are at a lower temperature but in the presence of water -- sedimentary rock. For this reason it is useful to introduce soft-matter concepts into the geological domain. There is a universality in the diverse instances of geological patterns that may be appreciated by looking at the common aspect in their formation of having passed through a stage as soft matter.</description>

      <title>The XY model with vision cone: non-reciprocal vs. reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the classical XY model on a two-dimensional square lattice, with interactions occurring within a vision cone of each spin. Via Monte Carlo simulations, we explore one non-reciprocal and two reciprocal implementations of these interactions. The corresponding energy involves couplings that depend non-trivially on the system's configuration, leading to both long-range and quasi-long-range ordered phases at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that non-reciprocity is not essential for achieving long-range order at low temperatures. Using symmetry arguments, we provide a theoretical framework to explain these findings, and additionally we uncover an unexpected order-by-disorder transition.</description>

      <title>Microscopic imprints of learned solutions in adaptive resistor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physical networks trained using supervised learning, physical parameters are adjusted to produce desired responses to inputs. An example is electrical contrastive local learning networks of nodes connected by edges that are resistors that adjust their conductances during training. When an edge conductance changes, it upsets the current balance of every node. In response, physics adjusts the node voltages to minimize the dissipated power. Learning in these systems is therefore a coupled double-optimization process, in which the network descends both a cost landscape in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, and a physical landscape -- the power -- in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. Because of this coupling, the physical landscape of a trained network contains information about the learned task. Here we demonstrate that all the physical information relevant to the trained input-output relation can be captured by a susceptibility, an experimentally measurable quantity. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations to show that the susceptibility is positively correlated with functional importance and that we can extract physical insight into how the system performs the task from the conductances of highly susceptible edges.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions preserve the universality class of Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $q$-state Potts model on a square lattice with directed nearest-neighbor spin-spin interactions that are inherently non-reciprocal. Both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics are investigated. Analytically, we demonstrate that non-reciprocal interactions do not alter the critical exponents of the model under equilibrium dynamics. In contrast, numerical simulations with selfish non-equilibrium dynamics reveal distinctive behavior. For $q=2$ (non-reciprocal non-equilibrium Ising model), the critical exponents remain consistent with those of the equilibrium Ising universality class. However, for $q=3$ and $q=4$, the critical exponents vary continuously. Remarkably, a super-universal scaling function -- Binder cumulant as a function of $\xi_2/\xi_0$, where $\xi_2$ is the second moment correlation length and $\xi_0$ its maximum value -- remains identical to that of the equilibrium $q=3,4$ Potts models. These findings indicate that non-reciprocal Potts models belong to the superuniversality class of their respective equilibrium counterparts.</description>

      <title>Emergent cell migration from cell shape deformations and T1 transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect: cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</description>

      <title>Site-percolation transition of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study percolation transition of run and tumble particles (RTPs) on a two dimensional square lattice. RTPs in these models run to the nearest neighbour along their internal orientation with unit rate, and to other nearest neighbours with rates $p$. In addition, they tumble to change their internal orientation with rate $\omega$. We show that for small tumble rates, RTP-clusters created by joining occupied nearest neighbours irrespective of their orientation form a phase separated state when the rate of positional diffusion $p$ crosses a threshold; with further increase of $p$ the clusters disintegrate and another transition to a mixed phase occurs. The critical exponents of this re-entrant site-percolation transition of RTPs vary continuously along the critical line in the $\omega$-$p$ plane, but a scaling function remains invariant. This function is identical to the corresponding universal scaling function of percolation transition observed in the Ising model. We also show that the critical exponents of the underlying motility induced phase separation transition are related to corresponding percolation-critical-exponents by constant multiplicative factors known from the correspondence of magnetic and percolation critical exponents of the Ising model.</description>
