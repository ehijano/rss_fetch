      <title>Efficient calculation of magnetic fields from ferromagnetic materials near strong electromagnets, and application to stellarator coil optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fusion reactor design, steels under consideration for the blanket are ferromagnetic, so the steel's effect on the plasma physics must be examined. For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel.</description>

      <title>Investigating the growth cycles of titania and carbonaceous nano dusty plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid nanoparticles which range in size from 1 to 500 nm can spontaneously grow from reactive gaseous precursors in nonthermal plasmas. This dissertation studies the particle size, and growth time with and without a background magnetic field in the plasma. Traditionally, studies have focused on the growth of either carbonaceous or silicate dust from either acetylene or silane, respectively. However, recently, there have been a shift towards studying new kinds of dust. For example, recent studies have grown polymers and metallic dust. This dissertation first introduces and studies the growth of titanium dioxide dust from the metal-organic vapor precursor of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The as-grown materials are amorphous but high temperature annealing crystallizes the samples into anatase and subsequently rutile. Then, the growth of titania dusty plasma is and compared to the growth of carbonaceous dust from acetylene, in argon plasma. They are grown during the presence and absence of weak magnetic fields of 500 Gauss. Both kinds of dust growth exhibit a growth cycle, which had already been shown for various nano dusty plasma. This occurs because once the dust accumulates a critical radius and mass, they move away from the central region of the plasma, allowing a new generation of growth begins. Ultimately, the new generation of growth also moves away leading to a continuous cycle of particle formation and transport as long as the plasma is on. However, with the presence of the magnetic field, the cycle time decreases, and the spatial distribution of the dust cloud appears differently. Finally, we focus on the growth cycle time of carbonaceous dust and how it decreases with a gradual increase in magnetic field, varying from 20 - 1000 Gauss. We particularly noticed a minimum at 330 Gauss, which coincides with electron magnetization.</description>

      <title>A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.</description>

      <title>Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation method for incoherent Thomson scattering spectra from arbitrary electron distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a Monte Carlo simulation method to calculate incoherent Thomson scattering spectra in high temperature plasmas. The basic idea is to treat the entire scattering process as the superposition of individual photon-electron interactions. We introduce macro-particles, referred from particle-in-cell simulations, to reduce the computational cost, and obtain scattered spectra within a reasonable computational time. Since the velocity of the interacting electron is randomly sampled from an electron distribution function, the method can be applied to arbitrary electron distribution functions provided an appropriate sampling scheme is available. We present simulation results for relativistic Maxwellian and kappa distribution functions, and compare them with both analytical and numerical spectra for validation. The simulated spectra show good agreement with both analytical and numerical results, demonstrating that the Monte Carlo simulation method can reliably reproduce incoherent Thomson scattering spectra.</description>

      <title>Helical Core Formation and MHD Stability in ITER-Scale Plasmas with Fusion-born Alpha Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of fusion-born alpha particles on the helical core (HC), a long-lived ideal saturation state of the $m/n=1/1$ kink/quasi-interchange mode, is studied in the ITER-scale hybrid scenario where a core plasma has a low magnetic shear $q\gtrsim1$. The HC state is determined by 3-D MHD force balance and all factors that contribute to it, such as plasma shaping, the safety factor profile, and the pressure profiles of all particle species. An incomplete but useful measure of the HC is the displacement of the magnetic axis, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$. Using MHD-PIC simulations, we find that $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ is enhanced by increasing alpha particle pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$. Within the ITER operating alpha pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0) \lesssim 1\%$, $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ can be approximately treated as part of the total MHD pressure. In this regime, there is no notable flattening of the pressure profile, indicating that the HC preserves the omnigenity of the plasma. If one increases $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)$ beyond $1\%$, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ continues to increase with $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ until it reaches an upper limit at $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)=3\%$ for our reference case. At this limit, both the bulk and alpha pressure profiles are partially flattened, indicating a reduction in omnigenity. After HC formation, a resistive pressure-driven MHD mode can become unstable, which is localized along the compressed magnetic flux region of the HC. This secondary mode consists of a broad spectrum of short-wavelength Fourier components that grow at same rates and are thus part of a single coherent entity. Our present simulation model is insufficient to adequately represent such a secondary mode; however, preliminary results suggest that it can facilitate magnetic chaos, which affects plasma confinement.</description>

      <title>Ion-Scale Solitary Structures in the Solar Wind Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of ion-scale magnetic solitary structures in the solar wind, characterized by distinct magnetic field enhancements and bipolar rotations over spatial scales of several proton inertial lengths. These structures are revisited using high-resolution data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions. Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a thousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and physical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more abundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around (30 - 40, R_sun) and decreasing farther out. High-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found in low-beta (beta &lt;= 1) environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity, and magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma density drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This leads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01 at 20 R_sun), making detection challenging. Magnetic field variance analysis indicates that these structures are primarily oblique to the local magnetic field. Alfv\'enic velocity-magnetic field correlations suggest that most of these structures, unlike most near-Sun solar wind fluctuations, exhibit sunward-directed Alfv\'enic polarization in the plasma frame. We compare these findings with previous studies, discussing possible generation mechanisms and their implications for the turbulent cascade in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind. While these structures might be Alfv\'enic solitons, vortices, or flux ropes, we refrain from a definitive classification pending further evidence. Further high-resolution observations and simulations are needed to fully understand their origins and impacts.</description>
