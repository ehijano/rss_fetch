      <title>Kostant $\rho$-decomposition of homology I. Finite-dimensional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit, uniform formulas for the graded characters and total ranks of the Lie algebra homology of finite-dimensional representations in all classical types. In many cases, these compute the Tor groups of finite length modules over polynomial rings, and this is the first in a series of papers to investigate total rank conjectures from this perspective. These formulas refine and generalize the classical $\rho$-decomposition of Kostant, and in particular we prove that the characters involved exhibit three structural phenomena: divisibility (by a large power of 2), equidistribution, and uniform factorization formulas.</description>

      <title>Coefficient systems on the A_2 Bruhat-Tits building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a conjecture (referred to as sur in the literature) in the representation theory of a reductive p-adic Lie group G which has important implications for the relationship between mod-p smooth representations and pro-p Iwahori-Hecke modules, and is currently only known for G of rank 1. We prove that sur follows from exactness of the associated oriented chain complex of a coefficient system, when restricted to a local region of the Bruhat-Tits building for G. Our main result gives strong evidence towards this exactness in the case where G=SL_3(K) for K a totally ramified extension of Q_p. We also develop new combinatorial techniques for analysing the geometric realisation of the A_2 Bruhat-Tits building, which are fundamental to the proof of our main result, and which we hope will inspire further investigation in Bruhat-Tits theory.</description>

      <title>On the Orthogonal Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any ${\rm E}$-rigid presentation $e$, we construct an orthogonal projection functor to ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ left adjoint to the natural embedding. We establish a bijection between presentations in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ and presentations compatible with $e$. For quivers with potentials, we show that ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ forms a module category of another quiver with potential. We derive mutation formulas for the $\delta$-vectors of positive and negative complements and the dimension vectors of simple modules in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$, enabling an algorithm to find the projected quiver with potential. Additionally, we introduce a modified projection for quivers with potentials that preserves general presentations. For applications to cluster algebras, we establish a connection to the stabilization functors.</description>

      <title>Quiver Yangian algebras associated to Dynkin diagrams of A-type and their rectangular representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between simple Lie algebras and their Yangian algebras has a long history. In this work, we construct finite-dimensional representations of Yangian algebras $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{sl}_{n})$ using the quiver approach. Starting from quivers associated to Dynkin diagrams of type A, we construct a family of quiver Yangians. We show that the quiver description of these algebras enables an effective construction of representations with a single non-zero Dynkin label. For these representations, we provide an explicit construction using the equivariant integration over the corresponding quiver moduli spaces. The resulting states admit a crystal description and can be identified with the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}$ algebras. Finally, we show that the resulting Yangians possess notable algebraic properties, and the algebras are isomorphic to their alternative description known as the second Drinfeld realization.</description>

      <title>On RoCK blocks of double covers of symmetric and alternating groups and the refined Brou\'e conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita equivalences and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</description>

      <title>The ribbon category of representations of a crossed module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of representations of a crossed module is a direct generalization of the theory of representations of groups. For a finite group G, the Drinfeld quantum double of the group G is a Hopf algebra that represents a special case of crossed module of finite groups. Here we study how to extend the construction of the Drinfeld quantum double for any other kind of crossed module of finite groups. This leads to a Hopf algebra D(G, H) that presents similarities with a Drinfeld double. We then study simple subalgebras of D(G, H) and give two isomorphisms for the decomposition into a product of simple subalgebras. We then study the category D(G, H)-modFd of finite dimensional modules over D(G, H), which turns out to be isomorphic to the category of finite dimensional representations of finite crossed modules of groups. These categories being monoidal, we also study links between direct sums of simple objects and tensor products of simple objects and give some results for a Clebsch-Gordan formula. We, in this context, present and develop the character theory for representations of crossed modules of finite groups, and detail the proofs. We then study the category itself, which leads to some ribbon invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study representations of rational and pretzel tangle and knot groups into the affine group $\mathrm{AGL}(1,\mathbb{C})$, via a TQFT that is valued in the category of spans of singular vector bundles over $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$. For these families, we derive closed-form expressions for their Alexander polynomials and establish bounds on their zeros. Finally, we specialize the functor at $t=-1$ and analyze colorings of rational tangles in terms of spans of complex vector spaces.</description>

Abstract: Using analytic number theory techniques, Altu\u{g} showed that the contribution of the trivial representation to the Arthur-Selberg trace formula for GL(2) over $\Q$ could be cancelled by applying a modified Poisson summation formula to the regular elliptic contribution. Drawing on recent works, we re-examine these methods from an adelic perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we observe that Kelly's transfinite construction of free algebras yields a way to invert well-pointed endofunctors. In enriched settings, this recovers constructions of Keller, Seidel, and Chen-Wang. We also relate this procedure to localisation by spectra and to Heller's stabilisation.</description>

      <title>Markov chains on Weyl groups from the geometry of the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>A Course on Lie algebras and Chevalley groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are expanded notes from graduate courses about Lie algebras and Chevalley groups held at the University of Stuttgart. In the 1950s Chevalley showed how linear groups over arbitrary fields could be obtained~ -- ~by a uniform procedure~ -- ~from the simple Lie algebras over $\C$ occurring in the Cartan--Killing classification. Together with subsequent variations, Chevalley's work had a profound and long-lasting impact on group theory and Lie theory in general. Classical, and widely used references are the lectures notes by Steinberg (1967) and the monograph by Carter (1972). Our aim here is to present a self-contained introduction to the theory of Chevalley groups, based on recent simplifications arising from Lusztig's fundamental theory of ``canonical bases''. A further feature of our text is that we explicitly incorporate algorithmic methods in our treatment, both for the handling of substantial examples and regarding some aspects of the general theory. Eventually, this may turn into a book project.</description>

      <title>Tropical Toeplitz matrices and parametrisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set of infinite upper-triangular totally positive Toeplitz matrices has a classical parametrisation proved by Edrei et al and originally conjectured by Schoenberg, that involves pairs of sequences of positive real parameters. These matrices (and their parameters) are central for understanding characters of the infinite symmetric group by work of Thoma. On the other hand there is a very different parametrisation theorem that applies to the finite analogue of this set. These finite Toeplitz matrices and their parameters relate to quantum cohomology of flag varieties and mirror symmetry. In this paper we replace the positive reals by a semifield with valuation to then construct tropical analogues for both parametrisation theorems. In the finite case we tropicalise using positive generalised Puiseaux series. This builds on work of Judd and L\"udenbach. In the infinite case we use a new valued semifield of continuous functions. We arrive at different natural infinite analogues of totally positive Toeplitz matrices, depending on a choice of topology on our valued semifield. We then prove an asymptotic result relating the tropical parameters from the finite case to the tropicalisations of the Schoenberg parameters. Moreover, we show that our finite type tropical parametrisation map is given by Lusztig's weight map from the theory of canonical bases. This results in a surprising connection between the classical Edrei theorem with its Schoenberg parameters and Lusztig's canonical basis parametrisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>Exact structures and maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories for modules over type $A$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties.
  On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\operatorname{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data.
  We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\operatorname{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\operatorname{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize random-to-random shuffling from a Markov chain on the symmetric group to one on the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and show that its eigenvalues are polynomials in q with non-negative integer coefficients. Setting q=1 recovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of random-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old conjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel connections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal forms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type A bow varieties. Vertex functions are K-theoretic analogs of I-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the q-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the q-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar\to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about I-functions of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Generalized Macdonald functions and quantum toroidal gl(1) algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19704</link>

Abstract: The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</description>
