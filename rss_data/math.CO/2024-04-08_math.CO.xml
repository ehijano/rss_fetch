      <title>Size Ramsey numbers of small graphs versus fans or paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the size Ramsey number $\hat{r}(G_1,G_2)$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ for which there exists a graph $G$ of size $m$ such that for any red-blue edge-coloring of the graph $G$, $G$ contains either a red subgraph isomorphic to $G_1$, or a blue subgraph isomorphic to $G_2$. Let $P_n$ be a path with $n$ vertices, $nK_2$ a matching with $n$ edges, and $F_n$ a graph with $n$ triangles sharing exactly one vertex. If $G_1$ is a small fixed graph and $G_2$ denotes any graph from a graph class, one can sometimes completely determine $\hat{r}(G_1,G_2)$. Faudree and Sheehan confirmed all size Ramsey numbers of $P_3$ versus complete graphs in 1983. The next year Erd\H{o}s and Faudree confirmed that of $2K_2$ versus complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs. We obtain three more Ramsey results of this type. For $n\ge 3$, we prove that $\hat{r}(P_3,F_n)=4n+4$ if $n$ is odd, and $\hat{r}(P_3,F_n)=4n+5$ if $n$ is even. This result refutes a conjecture proposed by Baskoro et al. We also show that $\hat{r}(2K_2,F_2)=12$ and $\hat{r}(2K_2,F_n)=5n+3$ for $n\ge 3$. In addition, we prove that $\hat{r}(2K_2,nP_m)=\min\{nm+1, (n+1)(m-1)\}$. This result verifies a conjecture posed by Vito and Silaban.</description>

      <title>Discrete Brunn-Minkowski Inequality for subsets of the cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all subsets $A_1, A_2,\dots, A_n\subseteq\{0,1\}^d$, we have $$ |A_1+A_2+\dots+A_n| \geq \prod_{i=1}^{n}|A_i|^{(\log_{2}(n+1))/n}. $$ In addition, we show that for all $A, B \subseteq \{0,1,2\}^{d}$ we have $$ |A+B|\geq (|A||B|)^{\log(5)/(2\log(3))}.$$ We also show that for all finite $A,B \subset \mathbb{Z}^{d}$, and any $V \subseteq\{0,1\}^{d}$ the inequality $$ |A+B+V|\geq |A|^{1/p}|B|^{1/q}|V|^{\log_{2}(p^{1/p}q^{1/q})} $$ holds for all $p \in (1, \infty)$, where $q=\frac{p}{p-1}$ is the conjugate exponent of $p$. All three estimates are dimension free with the best possible exponents. We also discuss applications to various related problems.</description>

      <title>The interplay between additive and symmetric large sets and their combinatorial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of symmetric structures is a new trend in Ramsey theory. Recently Di Nasso introduced a systematic study of symmetrization of classical Ramsey theoretical results and proved a symmetric version of several Ramsey theoretic results. In this paper Di Nasso asked if his method could be adapted to find new non-linear Diophantine equations that are partition regular. By analyzing additive, multiplicative, and symmetric large sets, we construct new partition regular equations that give a first affirmative answer to this question. Then we draw several new monochromatic patterns involving additive, multiplicative, and symmetric structures. Throughout our work, we use tools from the Algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactifications of discrete semigroups.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of tiling the plane with a fixed number of Wang bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the fixed parameter undecidability of tiling problem for a set of Wang tiles, Jeandel and Rolin show that the tiling problem for a set of 44 Wang bars is undecidable. In this paper, we improve their result by proving that whether a set of 29 Wang bars can tile the plane is undecidable. As a consequence, the tiling problem for a set of Wang tiles with color deficiency of 25 is also undecidable.</description>

      <title>From quasi-symmetric to Schur expansions with applications to symmetric chain decompositions and plethysm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an important problem in algebraic combinatorics to deduce the Schur function expansion of a symmetric function whose expansion in terms of the fundamental quasisymmetric function is known. For example, formulas are known for the fundamental expansion of a Macdonald symmetric function and for the plethysm of two Schur functions, while the Schur expansions of these expressions are still elusive. Egge, Loehr and Warrington provided a method to obtain the Schur expansion from the fundamental expansion by replacing each quasisymmetric function by a Schur function (not necessarily indexed by a partition) and using straightening rules to obtain the Schur expansion. Here we provide a new method that only involves the coefficients of the quasisymmetric functions indexed by partitions and the quasi-Kostka matrix. As an application, we identify the lexicographically largest term in the Schur expansion of the plethysm of two Schur functions. We provide the Schur expansion of $s_w[s_h](x,y)$ for $w=2,3,4$ using novel symmetric chain decompositions of Young's lattice for partitions in a $w\times h$ box. For $w=4$, this is first known combinatorial expression for the coefficient of $s_{\lambda}$ in $s_{w}[s_{h}]$ for two-row partitions $\lambda$, and for $w=3$ the combinatorial expression is new.</description>

      <title>On the biases and asymptotics of partitions with finite choices of parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biases in integer partitions have been studied recently. For three disjoint subsets $R,S,I$ of positive integers, let $p_{RSI}(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ with parts from $R\cup S\cup I$ and $p_{R&gt;S,I}(n)$ be the number of such partitions with more parts from $R$ than that from $S$. In this paper, in the case that $R,S,I$ are finite we obtain a concrete formula of the asymptotic ratio of $p_{R&gt;S,I}(n)$ to $p_{RSI}(n)$. We also propose a conjecture in the case that $R,S$ are certain infinite arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>On bipartite biregular large graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=V_1\cup V_2$ is biregular if all the vertices of each stable set, $V_1$ and $V_2$, have the same degree, $r$ and $s$, respectively. This paper studies difference sets derived from both Abelian and non-Abelian groups. From them, we propose some constructions of bipartite biregular graphs with diameter $d=3$ and asymptotically optimal order for given degrees $r$ and $s$. Moreover, we find some biMoore graphs, that is, bipartite biregular graphs that attain the Moore bound.</description>

      <title>A Nearly Finitary Matroid that is not $k$-Nearly Finitary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of $k$-nearly finitary matroids for some natural number $k$ is a subclass of the class of nearly finitary matroids. A natural question is whether this inclusion is proper. We answer this question affirmatively by constructing a nearly finitary matroid that is not $k$-nearly finitary for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>A characterization on $(g,f)$-parity orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $g,f:V(G)\to2^N$ be two set functions such that $g(v)\le f(v)$ and $g(v)\equiv f(v)\pmod 2$ for every $v\in V(G)$. An orientation $O$ of $G$ is called a $(g,f)$-parity orientation if $g(v)\le d^+_O(v)\le f(v)$ and $g(v)\equiv d^+_O(v)\pmod 2$ for every $v\in V(G)$. In this paper, we give a Tutte-type characterization for a graph to have a $(g,f)$-parity orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic Ky Fan theorem is a combinatorial equivalent of Borsuk-Ulam theorem. It is a generalization and extension of Tucker's lemma and, just like its predecessor, it pinpoints important properties of antipodal colorings of vertices of a triangulated sphere $S^n$. Here we describe generalizations of Ky Fan theorem for the case when the sphere is replaced by the total space of a triangulated sphere bundle.</description>

      <title>A Bollob\'as-type problem: from root systems to Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by an Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado type problem on sets of strongly orthogonal roots in the $A_{\ell}$ root system, we estimate bounds for the size of a family of pairs $(A_{i}, B_{i})$ of $k$-subsets in $\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that $A_{i} \cap B_{j}= \emptyset$ and $|A_{i} \cap A_{j}| + |B_{i} \cap B_{j}| = k$ for all $i \neq j$. This is reminiscent of a classic problem of Bollob\'as. We provide upper and lower bounds for this problem, relying on classical results of extremal combinatorics and an explicit construction using the incidence matrix of a finite projective plane.</description>

      <title>0-Hecke Modules, Domino Tableaux, and Type-$B$ Quasisymmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of ascent-compatibility from symmetric groups to all Coxeter groups, thereby providing a type-independent framework for constructing families of modules of $0$-Hecke algebras. We apply this framework in type $B$ to give representation-theoretic interpretations of a number of noteworthy families of type-$B$ quasisymmetric functions. Next, we construct modules of the type-$B$ $0$-Hecke algebra corresponding to type-$B$ analogues of Schur functions and introduce a type-$B$ analogue of Schur $Q$-functions; we prove that these shifted domino functions expand positively in the type-$B$ peak functions. We define a type-$B$ analogue of the $0$-Hecke--Clifford algebra, and we use this to provide representation-theoretic interpretations for both the type-$B$ peak functions and the shifted domino functions. We consider the modules of this algebra induced from type-$B$ $0$-Hecke modules constructed via ascent-compatibility and prove a general formula, in terms of type-$B$ peak functions, for the type-$B$ quasisymmetric characteristics of the restrictions of these modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of a given bipartite graph $G = (V, E)$, it is elementary to construct a bipartition in time $O(|E|)$. For a given $k$-graph $H = H^{(k)}$ with $k \geq 3$ fixed, Lov\'asz proved that deciding whether $H$ is bipartite is NP-complete. Let $\mathcal{B}_n$ denote the collection of all $[n]$-vertex bipartite $k$-graphs. We construct, of a given $H \in \mathcal{B}_n$, a bipartition in time averaging $O(n^k)$ over the class $\mathcal{B}_n$. (When $k=3$, our result expedites one of Person and Schacht.) We also consider an application to the class of all $[n]$-vertex 3-graphs $H$ forbidding the Fano plane as a subhypergraph.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the number of signed permutations with exactly $k$ inversions, which is denoted by $i_B(n,k)$ and called \textit{Mahonian numbers of type $B$}. Then we provide a recurrence relation for the Mahonian numbers $i_B(n,k)$. In addition, we give an explicit recursive description for the summation of inversions of all permutations in the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$, denoted by $\mathcal{B}_n$. Furthermore, we enumerate the total number of inversions in permutations in the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ concretely with the help of an inversion statistic and a backward permutation concepts on $B_n$.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Polynomial sumset structures on $\mathbb{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we searh for monochromatic infinite additive structures involving polynomials on $\mathbb{N}$. Ultimately, we can build the following results: (1) For any $r\in \mathbb{N}$, any distinct natural numbers $a,b$ and any $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exist subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $|B|=r$ and $|C|=\infty$ such that there exists a color containing $B+aC$ and $B+bC$; (2) For any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ and any $P\in \mathbb{Z}[n]$ with positive leading coefficient and zero constant term, there exist infinite subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $P(C)\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $B\subset P(\mathbb{N})$ such that $B+P(C)$ is monochromatic. In fact, for the specific question considered by us, the above results may be the best.</description>

      <title>Association schemes arising from non-weakly regular bent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Association schemes play an important role in algebraic combinatorics and have important applications in coding theory, graph theory and design theory. The methods to construct association schemes by using bent functions have been extensively studied. Recently, in [13], {\"O}zbudak and Pelen constructed infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $5$ and $6$ by using ternary non-weakly regular bent functions.They also stated that constructing $2p$-class association schemes from $p$-ary non-weakly regular bent functions is an interesting problem, where $p&gt;3$ is an odd prime. In this paper, using non-weakly regular bent functions, we construct infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $2p$, $(2p+1)$ and $\frac{3p+1}{2}$ for any odd prime $p$. Fusing those association schemes, we also obtain $t$-class symmetric association schemes, where $t=4,5,6,7$. In addition, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions for the partitions $P$, $D$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ (defined in this paper) to induce symmetric association schemes.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for the number of substructures in finite geometries from the container method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use techniques from algebraic and extremal combinatorics to derive upper bounds on the number of independent sets in several (hyper)graphs arising from finite geometry. In this way, we obtain asymptotically sharp upper bounds for partial ovoids and EKR-sets of flags in polar spaces, line spreads in $\mathrm{PG}(2r-1,q)$ and plane spreads in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$, and caps in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$. The latter result extends work due to Roche-Newton and Warren and Bhowmick and Roche-Newton. Finally, we investigate caps in $p$-random subsets of $\mathrm{PG}(r,q)$, which parallels recent work for arcs in projective planes by Bhowmick and Roche-Newton, and by Roche-Newton and Warren, and arcs in projective spaces by Chen, Liu, Nie and Zeng.</description>

      <title>A new family of locally $5$-arc transitive graphs of pushing up type with respect to the prime 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a power of the prime 3. A locally 5-arc transitive $G$-graph of pushing up type is constructed for each value of $q$. For $q=3$, the $G$-graph constructed provides an example of a graph with a vertex stabilizer amalgam of shape ${\cal E}_1$ in the sense of [1]. Whereas, for the other values of $q$, the vertex stabilizer amalgam of the $G$-graph is of a previously unknown shape. In particular, for $q \neq 3$, these graphs are the first examples of locally 5-arc transitive graphs containing a vertex $z$ for which the group that fixes all 3-arcs originating at $z$ is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Spanning plane subgraphs of $1$-plane graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph drawn on the plane is called $1$-plane if each edge is crossed at most once by another edge. In this paper, we show that every $4$-connected $1$-plane graph has a connected spanning plane subgraph. We also show that there exist infinitely many $4$-connected $1$-plane graphs that have no $2$-connected spanning plane subgraphs. Moreover, we consider the condition of $k$ and $l$ such that every $k$-connected $1$-plane graph has an $l$-connected spanning plane subgraph.</description>

      <title>General position sets, colinear sets, and Sierpi\'{n}ski product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G \otimes _f H$ denote the Sierpi\'nski product of $G$ and $H$ with respect to the function $f$. The Sierpi\'nski general position number ${\rm gp}{_{\rm S}}(G,H)$ is introduced as the cardinality of a largest general position set in $G \otimes _f H$ over all possible functions $f$. Similarly, the lower Sierpi\'nski general position number $\underline{{\rm gp}}{_{\rm S}}(G,H)$ is the corresponding smallest cardinality. The concept of vertex-colinear sets is introduced. Bounds for the general position number in terms of extremal vertex-colinear sets, and bounds for the (lower) Sierpi\'nski general position number are proved. The extremal graphs are investigated. Formulas for the (lower) Sierpi\'nski general position number of the \SP{s} with $K_2$ as the first factor are deduced. It is proved that if $m,n\geq 2$, then ${\rm gp}{_{\rm S}}(K_m,K_n) = m(n-1)$ and that if $n\ge 2m-2$, then $\underline{{\rm gp}}{_{\rm S}}(K_m,K_n) = m(n-m+1)$.</description>

      <title>The Fortuin-Kasteleyn polynomial as a bialgebra morphism and applications to the Tutte polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute an explicit formula for the antipode of the double bialgebra of graphs in terms of totally acyclic partial orientations, using some general results on double bialgebras. In analogy to what was already  proven in Hopf-algebraic terms for the chromatic polynomial of a graph, we show that the Fortuin-Kasteleyn polynomial (a variant of the Tutte polynomial) is a morphism of the double algebra of graphs into that of polynomials, which generalizes the chromatic polynomial. When specialized at particular values, we give  combinatorial interpretations of the Tutte  polynomial of a graph, via covering graphs and covering forests, and of the  Fortuin-Kasteleyn polynomial, via pairs of vertex--edge colorings. Finally we show that the map associating to a graph all its orientations is a Hopf morphism from the double bialgebra of graphs into that one of oriented graphs, allowing to give interpretations of the  Fortuin-Kasteleyn polynomial when computed at negative values.</description>

      <title>The planar Tur\'an number of $\{K_4,\Theta_5\}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of graphs. The planar Tur\'an number, $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,\mathcal{F})$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex planar graph which does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. In this paper, we give upper bounds of $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,\{K_4,\Theta_5\})\leqslant25/11(n-2)$. We also give constructions which show the bounds are tight for infinitely many graphs.</description>

      <title>Extending the Continuum of Six-Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two novel six-colorings of the Euclidean plane that avoid monochromatic pairs of points at unit distance in five colors and monochromatic pairs at another specified distance $d$ in the sixth color. Such colorings have previously been known to exist for $0.41 &lt; \sqrt{2} - 1 \le d \le 1 / \sqrt{5} &lt; 0.45$. Our results significantly expand that range to $0.354 \le d \le 0.657$, the first improvement in 30 years. Notably, the constructions underlying this were derived by formalizing colorings suggested by a custom machine learning approach.</description>

Abstract: The first Zagreb index $M_{1}(G)$ is equal to the sum of squares of the degrees of the vertices, and the second Zagreb index $M_{2}(G)$ is equal to the sum of the products of the degrees of pairs of adjacent vertices of the underlying molecular graph $G$. This paper aims to investigate the Zagreb indices and coindices of the line graph and line cut-vertex graph of a class of unicyclic graphs called cycle-star graph using the notion of subdivision.</description>

      <title>On the chromatic number of powers of subdivisions of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given graph $G=(V,E)$, we define its $n$-th subdivision as the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing every edge by a path of length $n$. We also define the $m$-th power of $G$ as the graph on vertex set $V$ where we connect every pair of vertices at distance at most $m$ in $G$. In this paper we study the chromatic number of powers of subdivisions of graphs and we obtain an exact bound for $n=3$ and $m=2$. Additionally, we resolve the case $m=n$ asymptotically; in particular, our result confirms a conjecture of Mozafari-Nia and Iradmusa in the case $m=n=3$ in a strong sense.</description>

      <title>Modulus for bases of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the application of modulus in matroid theory, specifically, the modulus of the family of bases of matroids. This study not only recovers various concepts in matroid theory, including the strength, fractional arboricity, and principal partitions, but also offers new insights. In the process, we introduce the concept of a Beurling set. Additionally, our study revisits and provides an alternative approach to two of Edmonds's theorems related to the base packing and base covering problems. This is our stepping stone for establishing Fulkerson modulus duality for the family of bases. Finally, we provide a relationship between the base modulus of matroids and their dual matroids, and a complete understanding of the base $p$-modulus across all values of $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kakeya problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is about estimating the size of union of $k$-planes; the projection problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is about estimating the size of projection of a set onto every $k$-plane ($1\le k\le n-1$). The $k=1$ case has been studied on general manifolds in which $1$-planes become geodesics, while $k\ge 2$ cases were still only considered in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We formulate these problems on homogeneous spaces, where $k$-planes are replaced by $k$-dimensional totally geodesic submanifolds. After formulating the problem, we prove a sharp estimate for Grassmannians.</description>

Our main result is that the theory of this structure is $\mathrm{SOP}_3$, $\mathrm{TP}_2$, and $\mathrm{NSOP}_4$. We offer two proofs of this fact: one is a direct proof, and the other employs part of the abstract machinery recently developed by Mutchnik.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a fully faithful embedding of projective geometries, given in terms of closure operators, into $\mathbb{F}_1$-modules, in the sense of Connes and Consani. This factors through a faithful functor out of simple pointed matroids. This follows from our construction of a fully faithful embedding of weakly unital, commutative hypermagmas into $\fun$-modules. This embedding is of independent interest as it generalizes the classical Eilenberg-MacLane embedding for commutative monoids and recovers Segal's nerve construction for commutative partial monoids. For this reason, we spend some time elaborating its structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of Iwasawa theory for branched $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-towers of finite connected graphs. These towers are more general than what have been studied so far, since the morphisms of graphs involved are branched covers, a particular kind of harmonic morphisms of graphs. We prove an analogue of Iwasawa's asymptotic class number formula for the $p$-part of the number of spanning trees in this setting. Moreover, we find an explicit generator for the characteristic ideal of the torsion Iwasawa module governing the growth of the $p$-part of the number of spanning trees in such towers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implication problem for conditional independence (CI) asks whether the fact that a probability distribution obeys a given finite set of CI relations implies that a further CI statement also holds in this distribution. This problem has a long and fascinating history, cumulating in positive results about implications now known as the semigraphoid axioms as well as impossibility results about a general finite characterization of CI implications. Motivated by violation of faithfulness assumptions in causal discovery, we study the implication problem in the special setting where the CI relations are obtained from a directed acyclic graphical (DAG) model along with one additional CI statement. Focusing on the Gaussian case, we give a complete characterization of when such an implication is graphical by using algebraic techniques. Moreover, prompted by the relevance of strong faithfulness in statistical guarantees for causal discovery algorithms, we give a graphical solution for an approximate CI implication problem, in which we ask whether small values of one additional partial correlation entail small values for yet a further partial correlation.</description>

Abstract: We give a Orlik-Solomon type presentation for the cohomology ring of arrangements in a non-compact abelian Lie group. The new insight consists in comparing arrangements in different abelian groups. Our work is based on the Varchenko-Gelfand ring for real hyperplane arrangements and from that we deduce the cohomology rings of all other abelian arrangements. As by-product, we obtain a new proof of the Orlik-Solomon relations and De Concini-Procesi ones.</description>

We compare the average time complexity of the breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms, when the target node is selected uniformly at random among all nodes at level $\ell$ in the ordered trees with $n$ edges. Intuition suggests that BFS should have better average performance when $\ell$ is small, while DFS must have an advantage when $\ell$ is large. But where exactly is the threshold, as a function of $n$, and is it unique? We obtain explicit formulas for the expected number of steps of both BFS and DFS, by using results on the occupation measure of Brownian excursions, as well as a combinatorial proof of an identity related to lattice paths. This allows us to show that there exists a unique constant $\lambda\approx 0.789004$, such that in expectation BFS is asymptotically faster than DFS if and only if $\ell\leq \lambda\sqrt{n}$. Furthermore, we find the asymptotic average time complexity of BFS in the given setting for any class of Galton$\unicode{x2013}$Watson trees, including binary trees and ordered trees. Finally, we introduce the truncated DFS algorithm, which performs better than both BFS and DFS when $\ell$ is known in advance, and we find a formula evaluating the average time complexity of this algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the axiomatic study of affine oriented matroids (AOMs) on arbitrary ground sets, obtaining fundamental notions such as minors, reorientations and a natural embedding into the frame work of Complexes of Oriented Matroids. The restriction to the finitary case (FAOMs) allows us to study tope graphs and covector posets, as well as to view FAOMs as oriented finitary semimatroids. We show shellability of FAOMs and single out the FAOMs that are affinely homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, we study group actions on AOMs, whose quotients in the case of FAOMs are a stepping stone towards a general theory of affine and toric pseudoarrangements. Our results include applications of the multiplicity Tutte polynomial of group actions of semimatroids, generalizing enumerative properties of toric arrangements to a combinatorially defined class of arrangements of submanifolds. This answers partially a question by Ehrenborg and Readdy.</description>

      <title>Congruence for lattice path models with filter restrictions and long steps</title>

Abstract: We derive a path counting formula for two-dimensional lattice path model with filter restrictions in the presence of long steps, source and target points of which are situated near the filters. This solves a problem of finding an explicit formula for multiplicities of modules in tensor product decomposition of $T(1)^{\otimes N}$ for $U_q(sl_2)$ with divided powers, where $q$ is a root of unity. Combinatorial treatment of this problem calls for definition of congruence of regions in lattice path models, properties of which are explored in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We show that the independence number of $ G_{n,p}$ is concentrated on two values if $ n^{-2/3+ \epsilon} &lt; p \le 1$. This result is roughly best possible as an argument of Sah and Sawhney shows that the independence number is not, in general, concentrated on 2 values for $ p = o \left( (\log(n)/n)^{2/3} \right)$. The extent of concentration of the independence number of $ G_{n,p}$ for $ \omega(1/n) &lt;p \le n^{-2/3}$ remains an interesting open question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alon, Seymour and Thomas [1990] proved that every $n$-vertex graph excluding $K_t$ as a minor has treewidth less than $t^{3/2}\sqrt{n}$. Illingworth, Scott and Wood [2022] recently refined this result by showing that every such graph is a subgraph of some graph with treewidth $t-2$, where each vertex is blown up by a complete graph of order $O(\sqrt{tn})$. Solving an open problem of Illingworth, Scott and Wood [2022], we prove that the treewidth bound can be reduced to $4$ while keeping blowups of order $O_t(\sqrt{n})$. As an extension of the Lipton--Tarjan theorem, in the case of planar graphs, we show that the treewidth can be further reduced to $2$, which is best possible. We generalise this result for $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graphs, with blowups of order $O(t\sqrt{n})$. This setting includes graphs embeddable on any fixed surface.</description>

      <title>On the Circuit Diameter Conjecture for Counterexamples to the Hirsch Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit diameters of polyhedra are a fundamental tool for studying the complexity of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for finding lower bounds on combinatorial diameters. The main open problem in this area is the circuit diameter conjecture, the analogue of the Hirsch conjecture in the circuit setting. A natural question is whether the well-known counterexamples to the Hirsch conjecture carry over. Previously, Stephen and Yusun showed that the Klee-Walkup counterexample to the unbounded Hirsch conjecture does not transfer to the circuit setting. Our main contribution is to show that the original counterexamples for the other variants, for bounded polytopes and using monotone walks, also do not transfer.
  Our results rely on new observations on structural properties of these counterexamples. To resolve the bounded case, we exploit the geometry of certain $2$-faces of the polytopes underlying all known bounded Hirsch counterexamples in Santos' work. For Todd's monotone Hirsch counterexample, we provide two alternative approaches. The first one uses sign-compatible circuit walks, and the second one uses the observation that Todd's polytope is anti-blocking. Along the way, we enumerate all linear programs over the polytope and find four new orientations that contradict the monotone Hirsch conjecture, while the remaining $7107$ satisfy the bound.</description>

      <title>(-1)-Enumerations of arrowed Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrowed Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns have recently been introduced to study alternating sign matrices. In this paper, we show that a $(-1)$-enumeration of arrowed Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns can be expressed by a simple product formula. The numbers are a one-parameter generalization of the numbers $2^{n(n-1)/2} \prod_{j=0}^{n-1} \frac{(4j+2)!}{(n+2j+1)!}$ that appear in recent work of Di Francesco. A second result concerns the (-1)-enumeration of arrowed Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns when excluding double-arrows as decoration in which case we also obtain a simple product formula. We are also able to provide signless interpretations of our results. The proofs of the enumeration formulas are based on a recent Littlewood-type identity, which allows us to reduce the problem to the evaluations of two determinants. The evaluations are accomplished by means of the LU-decompositions of the underlying matrices, and an extension of Sister Celine's algorithm as well as creative telescoping to evaluate certain triple sums. In particular, we use implementations of such algorithms by Koutschan, and by Wegschaider and Riese.</description>

      <title>The sufficient conditions for $k$-leaf-connected graphs in terms of several topological indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G), E(G))$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. For $k\geq2$ and given any subset $S\subseteq|V(G)|$ with $|S|=k$, if a graph $G$ of order $|V(G)|\geq k+1$ always has a spanning tree $T$ such that $S$ is precisely the set of leaves of $T$, then the graph $G$ is a $k$-leaf-connected graph. A graph $G$ is called Hamilton-connected if any two vertices of $G$ are connected by a Hamilton path. Based on the definitions of $k$-leaf-connected and Hamilton-connected, we known that a graph is $2$-leaf-connected if and only if it is Hamilton-connected. During the past decades, there have been many results of sufficient conditions for Hamilton-connected with respect to topological indices. In this paper, we present sufficient conditions for a graph $G$ to be $k$-leaf-connected in terms of the Zagreb index, the reciprocal degree distance or the hyper-Zagreb index. Furthermore, we use the first Zagreb index and hyper-Zagreb index of the complement graph $\overline{G}$ to give sufficient conditions for a graph $G$ to be $k$-leaf-connected.</description>

      <title>Sub-25-dimensional counterexamples to Borsuk's conjecture in the Leech lattice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06283v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1933, Karol Borsuk asked whether each bounded set in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space can be divided into $n$+1 parts of smaller diameter. Because it would not make sense otherwise, one usually assumes that he just forgot to require that the whole set contains at least two points. The hypothesis that the answer to that question is positive became famous under the name \emph{Borsuk's conjecture}. Counterexamples are known for any $n\ge 64$, since 2013.
  Let $\Lambda$ be the (original, unscaled) Leech lattice, a now very well-known infinite discrete vector set in the 24-dimensional Euclidean space. The smallest norm of nonzero vectors in $\Lambda$ is $\sqrt{32}$. Let $M$ be the set of the 196560 vectors in $\Lambda$ having this norm.
  For each $x \in M$, $-x$ is in $M$. Let $H$ be the set of all subsets of $M$ that for each $x$ in $M$ contain either $x$ or $-x$. Each element of $H$ has the same diameter $d = \sqrt{96}$. For dimensions $n&lt;24$ one can analogously construct respective $M_n$ and $H_n$ from laminated $n$-dimensional sublattices $\Lambda_n$ of $\Lambda$. For uniformity, let $\Lambda_{24}=\Lambda$, $M_{24} = M$ and $H_{24} = H$.
  If $M_n$ is divisible into at most $n+1$ parts of diameter below $d$ then this applies to all elements of $H_n$, too. I have checked that this is the case for all $n \le 21$. For $n$ from 22 to 24, the minimum number of parts of diameter below $d$ that I was able to divide $M_n$ into are 25, 29 and 35, resp. The source package of this article contains a data file encoding an element of $H_{24}=H$ that I can not divide into less than 30 parts of smaller diameter.</description>

Abstract: One of the main properties of modulus on graphs is Fulkerson duality. In this paper, we study Fulkerson duality for spanning tree modulus. We introduce a new notion of Beurling partition, and we identify two important ones, which correspond to the notion of strength and maximum denseness of an arbitrary graph. These special partitions, also give rise to two deflation processes that reveal a hierarchical structure for general graphs. While Fulkerson duality for spanning tree families can be deduced from a well-known result in combinatorics due to Chopra, we give an alternative approach based on a result of Nash-Williams and Tutte. Finally, we introduce the weighted variant of spanning tree modulus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a directed graph is the minimum number of induced acyclic subdigraphs that cover its vertex set, and accordingly, the chromatic number of a tournament is the minimum number of transitive subtournaments that cover its vertex set. The neighborhood of an arc $uv$ in a tournament $T$ is the set of vertices that form a directed triangle with arc $uv$. We show that if the neighborhood of every arc in a tournament has bounded chromatic number, then the whole tournament has bounded chromatic number. This holds more generally for oriented graphs with bounded independence number, and we extend our proof from tournaments to this class of dense digraphs. As an application, we prove the equivalence of a conjecture of El-Zahar and Erd\H{o}s and a recent conjecture of Nguyen, Scott and Seymour relating the structure of graphs and tournaments with high chromatic number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers multiple domination on Kneser graphs. We focus on $k$-tuple dominating sets, $2$-packings and the associated graph parameters $k$-tuple domination number and $2$-packing number. In particular, we compute the $2$-packing number of Kneser graphs $K(3r-2,r)$ and in odd graphs we obtain minimum $k$-tuple dominating sets of $K(7,3)$ and $K(11,5)$ for every $k$. Besides, we determine the Kneser graphs $K(n,r)$ with $k$-tuple domination number exactly $k+r$ and find all the minimum $k$-tuple dominating sets for these graphs, which generalize results for domination on Kneser graphs. Finally, we give a characterization of the $k$-tuple dominating sets of $K(n,2)$ in terms of the occurrences of the elements in $[n]$, which allows us to obtain minimum sized $k$-tuple dominating sets of $K(n,2)$ for $n\geq \Omega(\sqrt{k})$.
  Keywords: Kneser graphs, multiple domination, $k$-tuple domination, $2$-packings.</description>

Abstract: The local $h^*$-polynomial of a lattice polytope is an important invariant arising in Ehrhart theory. Our focus in this work is on lattice simplices presented in Hermite normal form with a single non-trivial row. We prove that when the off-diagonal entries are fixed, the distribution of coefficients for the local $h^*$-polynomial of these simplices has a limit as the normalized volume goes to infinity. Further, this limiting distribution is determined by the coefficients for a relatively small normalized volume. We also provide a thorough analysis of two specific families of such simplices, to illustrate and motivate our main result.</description>

Abstract: Bj\"orner and Ekedahl [Ann. of Math. (2), 170.2(2009), pp. 799--817] pioneered the study of length-counting sequences associated with parabolic lower Bruhat intervals in crystallographic Coxeter groups. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of these sequences in affine Weyl groups. Let $W$ be an affine Weyl group with corresponding Weyl group $W_f$ and ${}^{f}{W}$ be the set of minimal representatives for the right cosets $W_f \backslash W$. Let $t_{\lambda}$ be the translation by a dominant coroot lattice element $\lambda$ and ${}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}}$ be the number of elements of length $i$ below $t_\lambda$ in the Bruhat order on ${}^{f}{W}$. We show that the sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}})_i$ is ''asymptotically log-concave'' in the following sense: The sequence of discrete measures $(\mathfrak{m}_k)_k$ constructed from the $k$-fold dilated sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$, as $k$ tends to infinity, converges weakly to a continuous measure obtained from a polytope $P^\lambda$. Moreover, the sequence of step functions $(S_k)_k$ of $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$ converges uniformly to the density function of this continuous measure. By Brunn--Minkowski inequality, this density is log-concave.</description>

      <title>Freeness of hyperplane arrangements associated with gain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08304v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Athanasiadis studied arrangements obtained by adding shifted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. Similarly, Bailey studied arrangements obtained by adding tilted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. These two kinds of arrangements are associated with directed graphs and their freeness was characterized in terms of the associated graphs. In addition, there is coincidence of freeness. Namely, if Athanasiadis' arrangement is free, then the corresponding Bailey's arrangement is free, and vice versa.
  In this paper, we generalize this phenomenon by using gain graphs.</description>

      <title>Stable multivariate Narayana polynomials and labeled plane trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce stable multivariate generalizations of Narayana polynomials of type A and type B. We give an insertion algorithm for labeled plane trees and introduce the notion of improper edges. Our polynomials are multivariate generating polynomials of labeled plane trees and can be generated by a grammatical labeling based on a context-free grammar. Our proof of real stability uses a characterization of stable-preserving linear operators due to Borcea and Br\"and\'en. In particular, we get an alternative multivariate stable refinement of the second-order Eulerian polynomials, which is different from the one given by Haglund and Visontai.</description>

      <title>Small planar hypohamiltonian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is hypohamiltonian if it is non-Hamiltonian, but the deletion of every single vertex gives a Hamiltonian graph. Until now, the smallest known planar hypohamiltonian graph had 40 vertices, a result due to Jooyandeh, McKay, \"Osterg{\aa}rd, Pettersson, and Zamfirescu. That result is here improved upon by two planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 34 vertices. We exploited a special subgraph contained in two graphs of Jooyandeh et al., and modified it to construct the two 34-vertex graphs and six planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 37 vertices. Each of the 34-vertex graphs has 26 cubic vertices, improving upon the result of Jooyandeh et al. that planar hypohamiltonian graphs have 30 cubic vertices. We use the 34-vertex graphs to construct hypohamiltonian graphs of order 34 with crossing number 1, improving the best-known bound of 36 due to Wiener. Whether there exists a planar hypohamiltonian graph on 41 vertices was an open question. We settled this question by applying an operation introduced by Thomassen to the 37-vertex graphs to obtain several planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 41 vertices. The 25 planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 40 vertices of Jooyandeh et al. have no nontrivial automorphisms. The result is here improved upon by six planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 40 vertices with nontrivial automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Graphs whose vertices of degree at least 2 lie in a triangle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pendant vertex is one of degree one and an isolated vertex has degree zero. A neighborhood star-free (NSF for short) graph is one in which every vertex is contained in a triangle except pendant vertices and isolated vertices. This class has been considered before for several contexts. In the present paper, we study the complexity of the dominating induced matching (DIM) problem and the perfect edge domination (PED) problem for NSF graphs. We prove the corresponding decision problems are NP-Complete for several of its subclasses. As an added value of this study, we have shown three connected variants of planar positive 1in3SAT are also NP-Complete. Since these variants are more basic in complexity theory context than many graph problems, these results can be useful to prove that other problems are NP-Complete.</description>

Abstract: A set of novel vertex-degree-based invariants was introduced by Gutman, denoted by \newline $SO_1, SO_2, \ldots,SO_6$. These invariants were constructed through geometric reasoning based on a new graph invariant framework. Motivated by proposed open problems in [Z. Tang, Q. Li, H. Deng, \textit{Trees with Extremal Values of the Sombor-Index-Like Graph Invariants}, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. \textbf{90} (2023) 203-222], we have found the maximum values of $SO_5$ and $SO_6$ in the set of molecular trees with a given number of vertices, respectively, and we have found the maximum value of $SO_5$ in a class of connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Rationality of Four-Valued Families of Weil Sums of Binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the rationality of Weil sums of binomials of the form $W^{K,s}_u=\sum_{x \in K} \psi(x^s - u x)$, where $K$ is a finite field whose canonical additive character is $\psi$, and where $u$ is an element of $K^{\times}$ and $s$ is a positive integer relatively prime to $|K^\times|$, so that $x \mapsto x^s$ is a permutation of $K$. The Weil spectrum for $K$ and $s$, which is the family of values $W^{K,s}_u$ as $u$ runs through $K^\times$, is of interest in arithmetic geometry and in several information-theoretic applications. The Weil spectrum always contains at least three distinct values if $s$ is nondegenerate (i.e., if $s$ is not a power of $p$ modulo $|K^\times|$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $K$). It is already known that if the Weil spectrum contains precisely three distinct values, then they must all be rational integers. We show that if the Weil spectrum contains precisely four distinct values, then they must all be rational integers, with the sole exception of the case where $|K|=5$ and $s \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k, \ell \in \mathbb{N}$, we introduce the concepts of $k$-ultrahomogeneity and $\ell$-tuple regularity for finite groups. Inspired by analogous concepts in graph theory, these form a natural generalization of homogeneity, which was studied by Cherlin and Felgner and Li as well as automorphism transitivity, which was investigated by Zhang. Additionally, these groups have an interesting algorithmic interpretation. We classify the $k$-ultrahomogeneous and $\ell$-tuple regular finite groups for $k, \ell \geq 2$. In particular, we show that every 2-tuple regular finite group is ultrahomogeneous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the number of complex solutions to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem on the Grassmannian in its Pl\"ucker embedding. This is motivated by quantum chemistry, where it represents the truncation to single electrons in coupled cluster theory. We prove the formula for the Grassmannian of lines which was conjectured in earlier work with Fabian Faulstich. This rests on the geometry of the graph of a birational parametrization of the Grassmannian. We present a squarefree Gr\"obner basis for this graph, and we develop connections to toric degenerations from representation theory.</description>

      <title>Effect of Constraint Relaxation on the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistical-mechanical study of the effect of constraint relaxation on the minimum vertex cover problem in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs is presented. Using a penalty-method formulation for constraint relaxation, typical properties of solutions, including infeasible solutions that violate the constraints, are analyzed by means of the replica method and cavity method. The problem involves a competition between reducing the number of vertices to be covered and satisfying the edge constraints. The analysis under the replica-symmetric (RS) ansatz clarifies that the competition leads to degeneracies in the vertex and edge states, which determine the quantitative properties of the system, such as the cover and penalty ratios. A precise analysis of these effects improves the accuracy of RS approximation for the minimum cover ratio in the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) region. Furthermore, the analysis based on the RS cavity method indicates that the RS/RSB boundary of the ground states with respect to the mean degree of the graphs is expanded, and the critical temperature is lowered by constraint relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sabidussi's theorem [Duke Math. J. 28, 1961] gives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the automorphism group of a lexicographic product of two graphs is a wreath product of the respective automorphism groups. We prove a quantum version of Sabidussi's theorem for finite graphs, with the automorphism groups replaced by quantum automorphism groups and the wreath product replaced by the free wreath product of quantum groups. This extends the result of Chassaniol [J. Algebra 456, 2016], who proved it for regular graphs. Moreover, we apply our result to lexicographic products of quantum vertex transitive graphs, determining their quantum automorphism groups even when Sabidussi's conditions do not apply.</description>
