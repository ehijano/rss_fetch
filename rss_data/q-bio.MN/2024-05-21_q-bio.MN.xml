      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the vulnerability of space habitats to cosmic radiation, which consists of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, raises important safety concerns for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation consists of experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators, marking a notable advancement in this field. Intriguingly, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth offer potential solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. Additionally, we recommend assessing the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Boolean matrix logic programming for active learning of gene functions in genome-scale metabolic network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Techniques to autonomously drive research have been prominent in Computational Scientific Discovery, while Synthetic Biology is a field of science that focuses on designing and constructing new biological systems for useful purposes. Here we seek to apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery. Comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) are often used to evaluate cellular engineering strategies to optimise target compound production. However, predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs, often due to errors in the models. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</description>

      <title>Biomarker Selection for Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomarkers enable objective monitoring of a given cell or state in a biological system and are widely used in research, biomanufacturing, and clinical practice. However, identifying appropriate biomarkers that are both robustly measurable and capture a state accurately remains challenging. We present a framework for biomarker identification based upon observability guided sensor selection. Our methods, Dynamic Sensor Selection (DSS) and Structure-Guided Sensor Selection (SGSS), utilize temporal models and experimental data, offering a template for applying observability theory to unconventional data obtained from biological systems. Unlike conventional methods that assume well-known, fixed dynamics, DSS adaptively select biomarkers or sensors that maximize observability while accounting for the time-varying nature of biological systems. Additionally, SGSS incorporates structural information and diverse data to identify sensors which are resilient against inaccuracies in our model of the underlying system. We validate our approaches by performing estimation on high dimensional systems derived from temporal gene expression data from partial observations.</description>
