      <title>Dual-Head Physics-Informed Graph Decision Transformer for Distribution System Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by recent advances in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technologies have shown great potential for addressing distribution system restoration (DSR) under uncertainty. However, their data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit their ability to handle scenarios that require long-term temporal dependencies or few-shot and zero-shot decision making. Emerging Decision Transformers (DTs), which leverage causal transformers for sequence modeling in DRL tasks, offer a promising alternative. However, their reliance on return-to-go (RTG) cloning and limited generalization capacity restricts their effectiveness in dynamic power system environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Dual-Head Physics-informed Graph Decision Transformer (DH-PGDT) that integrates physical modeling, structural reasoning, and subgoal-based guidance to enable scalable and robust DSR even in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. DH-PGDT features a dual-head physics-informed causal transformer architecture comprising Guidance Head, which generates subgoal representations, and Action Head, which uses these subgoals to generate actions independently of RTG. It also incorporates an operational constraint-aware graph reasoning module that encodes power system topology and operational constraints to generate a confidence-weighted action vector for refining DT trajectories. This design effectively improves generalization and enables robust adaptation to unseen scenarios. While this work focuses on DSR, the underlying computing model of the proposed PGDT is broadly applicable to sequential decision making across various power system operations and other complex engineering domains.</description>

      <title>Embedded Microcontrol for Photovoltaic Water Pumping System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel 3-axis solar tracker water pumping system. The charge generated from solar energy converted by the photovolatic panel (PV) cells is stored in a 12V battery that in turn powers two water diaphragm pumps using a solar charge controller that includes an MPPT algorithm that serves as a DC-DC converter. The system is analyzed from an embedded microcontroller and embedded software perspective using Arduino. The photovoltaic panel uses four light photocell resistors (LPRs) which measure solar light intensity. An ultrasonic sensor measures the water level in a reservoir water tank. If the water level is too low, water is pumped from one water tank to the reservoir tank. Using a soil moisture sensor, another water pump pumps water from the reservoir tank to the plant if water is needed. Circuit designs for the system are provided as well as the embedded software used. Simulation and experimental results are given.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Computing Strategy Based SINS Prediction for Emergency UAVs Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In emergency scenarios, the dynamic and harsh conditions necessitate timely trajectory adjustments for drones, leading to highly dynamic network topologies and potential task failures. To address these challenges, a collaborative computing strategy based strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) prediction for emergency UAVs network (EUN) is proposed, where a two-step weighted time expanded graph (WTEG) is constructed to deal with dynamic network topology changes. Furthermore, the task scheduling is formulated as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to WTEG mapping problem to achieve collaborative computing while transmitting among UAVs. Finally, the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm is employed to choose the mapping strategy that minimizes end-to-end processing latency. The simulation results validate that the collaborative computing strategy significantly outperforms both cloud and local computing in terms of latency. Moreover, the task success rate using SINS is substantially improved compared to approaches without prior prediction.</description>

      <title>Average Consensus with Dynamic Compression in Bandwidth-Limited Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the average consensus problem has been considered for directed unbalanced networks under finite bit-rate communication. We propose the Push-Pull Average Consensus algorithm with Dynamic Compression (PP-ACDC) algorithm, a distributed consensus algorithm that deploys an adaptive quantization scheme and achieves convergence to the exact average without the need of global information. A preliminary numerical convergence analysis and simulation results corroborate the performance of PP-ACDC.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Structural Heterogeneity from Functional Fairness in Complex Networks: A Theoretical Framework based on the Imbalance Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance evaluation of complex networks has traditionally focused on structural integrity or average transmission efficiency, perspectives that often overlook the dimension of functional fairness. This raises a central question: Under certain conditions, structurally heterogeneous networks can exhibit high functional fairness. To systematically address this issue, we introduce a new metric, Network Imbalance (I), designed to quantitatively assess end-to-end accessibility fairness from a perceived QoS perspective. By combining a tunable sigmoid function with a global Shannon entropy framework, the I metric quantifies the uniformity of connection experiences between all node pairs. We analyze the mathematical properties of this metric and validate its explanatory power on various classical network models. Our findings reveal that low imbalance (i.e., high functional fairness) can be achieved through two distinct mechanisms: one via topological symmetry (e.g., in a complete graph) and the other via extreme connection efficiency driven by structural inequality (e.g., in a scale-free network). This decoupling of structure and function provides a new theoretical perspective for network performance evaluation and offers an effective quantitative tool for balancing efficiency and fairness in network design.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Time Voltage Regulation for Boost Converters via Unit-Safe Saturating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the voltage regulation challenges in boost converter systems, which are critical components in power electronics due to their ability to step up voltage levels efficiently. The proposed control algorithm ensures fixed-time stability, a desirable property that guarantees system stability within a fixed time frame regardless of initial conditions. To tackle the common chattering issues in conventional fixed-time control methods, a novel class of function families is introduced. State observers and adaptive parameters are utilized to manage the uncertainties associated with unknown load resistance. Furthermore, a new disturbance observer is developed using the proposed function family, and its advantages and limitations are illustrated through comparison with existing designs. Finally, both non-real-time and real-time simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and deployability of the proposed control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enabled Adaptive Power Capping Scheme for Cloud Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the digital economy and artificial intelligence has transformed cloud data centers into essential infrastructure with substantial energy consumption and carbon emission, necessitating effective energy management. However, existing methods face challenges such as incomplete information, uncertain parameters, and dynamic environments, which hinder their real-world implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive power capping framework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy consumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to align with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we formulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Subsequently, we develop an uncertainty-aware model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method to perceive the cloud data center operational environment and optimize power-capping decisions. By incorporating a two-stage uncertainty-aware optimization algorithm into the MBRL, we improve its adaptability to the ever-changing environment. Additionally, we derive the optimality gap of the proposed scheme under finite iterations, ensuring effective decisions under complex and uncertain scenarios. The numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a cloud data center operational environment simulator built on real-world production traces from Alibaba, which demonstrates its potential as an efficient energy management solution for cloud data centers.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Control with Constraints on Linear Unidimensional Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally robust control is a well-studied framework for optimal decision making under uncertainty, with the objective of minimizing an expected cost function over control actions, assuming the most adverse probability distribution from an ambiguity set. We consider an interpretable and expressive class of ambiguity sets defined by constraints on the expected value of functions of one-dimensional linear projections of the uncertain parameters. Prior work has shown that, under conditions, problems in this class can be reformulated as finite convex problems. In this work, we propose two iterative methods that can be used to approximately solve problems of this class in the general case. The first is an approximate algorithm based on best-response dynamics. The second is an approximate method that first reformulates the problem as a semi-infinite program and then solves a relaxation. We apply our methods to portfolio construction and trajectory planning scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Analogy of Frequency Droop Control for Grid-forming Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analogy for a power system dominated by grid-forming (GFM) sources that proves to be a powerful visualization tool for analyses of power flow, frequency regulation, and power dispatch. Frequency droop characteristics of a typical GFM source are exactly reflected by an ordinary model of water vessels. The frequency is represented by visible water levels while the droop slope is reified by the vessel sizes. This proposed analogy allows us to use the intuitive water-flow phenomenon to explain the abstract power-flow problems. The grid integration of renewables via GFM inverters is interestingly simulated by a vessel connected to an infinite water tank. This paper also provides a means for demonstrating issues to audiences with little or no background in power systems. Finally, the proposal is verified by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Simulation for Real-Time Exploration of HVAC Demand Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy into the power grid has highlighted the critical importance of demand-side flexibility. Among flexible loads, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are particularly significant due to their high energy consumption and controllability. This study presents the development of an interactive simulation platform that integrates a high-fidelity simulation engine with a user-facing dashboard, specifically designed to explore and demonstrate the demand flexibility capacity of HVAC systems. Unlike conventional simulations, where users are passive observers of simulation results with no ability to intervene in the embedded control during the simulation, this platform transforms them into active participants. Users can override system default control settings, such as zone temperature setpoints and HVAC schedules, at any point during the simulation runtime to implement demand response strategies of their choice. This human-in-the-loop capability enables real-time interaction and allows users to observe the immediate impact of their actions, emulating the practical decision-making process of a building or system operator. By exploring different demand flexibility scenarios and system behaviour in a manner that reflects real-world operation, users gain a deeper understanding of demand flexibility and their impacts. This interactive experience builds confidence and supports more informed decision-making in the practical adoption of demand-side flexibility. This paper presents the architecture of the simulation platform, user-oriented dashboard design, and user case showcase. The introduced human-in-the-loop simulation paradigm offers a more intuitive and interactive means of engaging with grid-interactive building operations, extending beyond HVAC demand flexibility exploration.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Model Probabilistic Framework for Seismic Risk Assessment and Retrofit Planning of Electric Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric power networks are critical lifelines, and their disruption during earthquakes can lead to severe cascading failures and significantly hinder post-disaster recovery. Enhancing their seismic resilience requires identifying and strengthening vulnerable components in a cost-effective and system-aware manner. However, existing studies often overlook the systemic behavior of power networks under seismic loading. Common limitations include isolated component analyses that neglect network-wide interdependencies, oversimplified damage models assuming binary states or damage independence, and the exclusion of electrical operational constraints. These simplifications can result in inaccurate risk estimates and inefficient retrofit decisions. This study proposes a multi-model probabilistic framework for seismic risk assessment and retrofit planning of electric power systems. The approach integrates: (1) regional seismic hazard characterization with ground motion prediction and spatial correlation models; (2) component-level damage analysis using fragility functions and multi-state damage-functionality mappings; (3) system-level cascading impact evaluation through graph-based island detection and constrained optimal power flow analysis; and (4) retrofit planning via heuristic optimization to minimize expected annual functionality loss (EAFL) under budget constraints. Uncertainty is propagated throughout the framework using Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology is demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System, showcasing its ability to capture cascading failures, identify critical components, and generate effective retrofit strategies. Results underscore the potential of the framework as a scalable, data-informed decision-support tool for enhancing the seismic resilience of power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Generative Microscopic Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Acceleration of MILP Motion Planning with Temporal Logic and Chance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems must solve motion planning problems subject to increasingly complex, time-sensitive, and uncertain missions. These problems often involve high-level task specifications, such as temporal logic or chance constraints, which require solving large-scale Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). However, existing MILP-based planning methods suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability, hindering their real-time applicability. We propose to use a neuro-symbolic approach to accelerate MILP-based motion planning by leveraging machine learning techniques to guide the solver's symbolic search. Focusing on two representative classes of planning problems, namely, those with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and those with chance constraints formulated via Conformal Predictive Programming (CPP). We demonstrate how graph neural network-based learning methods can guide traditional symbolic MILP solvers in solving challenging planning problems, including branching variable selection and solver parameter configuration. Through extensive experiments, we show that neuro-symbolic search techniques yield scalability gains. Our approach yields substantial improvements, achieving an average performance gain of about 20% over state-of-the-art solver across key metrics, including runtime and solution quality.</description>

      <title>When are safety filters safe? On minimum phase conditions of control barrier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In emerging control applications involving multiple and complex tasks, safety filters are gaining prominence as a modular approach to enforcing safety constraints. Among various methods, control barrier functions (CBFs) are widely used for designing safety filters due to their simplicity, imposing a single linear constraint on the control input at each state. In this work, we focus on the internal dynamics of systems governed by CBF-constrained control laws. Our key observation is that, although CBFs guarantee safety by enforcing state constraints, they can inadvertently be "unsafe" by causing the internal state to diverge. We investigate the conditions under which the full system state, including the internal state, can remain bounded under a CBF-based safety filter. Drawing inspiration from the input-output linearization literature, where boundedness is ensured by minimum phase conditions, we propose a new set of CBF minimum phase conditions tailored to the structure imposed by the CBF constraint. A critical distinction from the original minimum phase conditions is that the internal dynamics in our setting is driven by a nonnegative virtual control input, which reflects the enforcement of the safety constraint. We include a range of numerical examples, including single-input, multi-input, linear, and nonlinear systems, validating both our analysis and the necessity of the proposed CBF minimum phase conditions.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Control Strategy with Direct Gate Control for Buck Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for directly controlling the gate signals of switching devices to achieve voltage regulation in a buck converter. Unlike conventional control methods, the proposed method directly generates gate signals using a neural network trained through DRL, with the objective of achieving high control speed and flexibility while maintaining stability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed direct gate control (DGC) method achieves a faster transient response and stable output voltage regulation, outperforming traditional PWM-based control schemes. The DGC method also exhibits strong robustness against parameter variations and sensor noise, indicating its suitability for practical power electronics applications. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated via simulation.</description>

      <title>Robust Integrated Priority and Speed Control based on Hierarchical Stochastic Optimization to Promote Bus Schedule Adherence along Signalized Arterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), adaptive transit signal priority (TSP) and dynamic bus control systems have been independently developed to maintain efficient and reliable urban bus services. However, those two systems could potentially lead to conflicting decisions due to the lack of coordination. Although some studies explore the integrated control strategies along the arterial, they merely rely on signal replanning to address system uncertainties. Therefore, their performance severely deteriorates in real-world intersection settings, where abrupt signal timing variation is not always applicable in consideration of countdown timers and pedestrian signal design.
  In this study, we propose a robust integrated priority and speed control strategy based on hierarchical stochastic optimization to enhance bus schedule adherence along the arterial. In the proposed framework, the upper level ensures the coordination across intersections while the lower level handles uncertainties for each intersection with stochastic programming. Hence, the route-level system randomness is decomposed into a series of local problems that can be solved in parallel using sample average approximation (SAA). Simulation experiments are conducted under various scenarios with stochastic bus dwell time and different traffic demand. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances bus punctuality and time headway equivalence without abrupt signal timing variation, with negative impacts on car delays limited to only 0.8%-5.2% as traffic demand increases.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning with Local Interpretability for Transparent Microgrid Resilience Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable energy integration into microgrids has become a key approach to addressing global energy issues such as climate change and resource scarcity. However, the variability of renewable sources and the rising occurrence of High Impact Low Probability (HILP) events require innovative strategies for reliable and resilient energy management. This study introduces a practical approach to managing microgrid resilience through Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL). It combines the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for decision-making with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to improve the transparency of the actor network's decisions. A case study in Ongole, India, examines a microgrid with wind, solar, and battery components to validate the proposed approach. The microgrid is simulated under extreme weather conditions during the Layla cyclone. LIME is used to analyse scenarios, showing the impact of key factors such as renewable generation, state of charge, and load prioritization on decision-making. The results demonstrate a Resilience Index (RI) of 0.9736 and an estimated battery lifespan of 15.11 years. LIME analysis reveals the rationale behind the agent's actions in idle, charging, and discharging modes, with renewable generation identified as the most influential feature. This study shows the effectiveness of integrating advanced DRL algorithms with interpretable AI techniques to achieve reliable and transparent energy management in microgrids.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Discrete-Time Control Barrier Certificate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a robust adaptive control strategy for discrete-time systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure safety under parametric model uncertainty and disturbances. A key contribution of this work is establishing a barrier function certificate in discrete time for general online parameter estimation algorithms. This barrier function certificate guarantees positive invariance of the safe set despite disturbances and parametric uncertainty without access to the true system parameters. In addition, real-time implementation and inherent robustness guarantees are provided. Our approach demonstrates that, using the proposed robust adaptive CBF framework, the parameter estimation module can be designed separately from the CBF-based safety filter, simplifying the development of safe adaptive controllers for discrete-time systems. The resulting safety filter guarantees that the system remains within the safe set while adapting to model uncertainties, making it a promising strategy for real-world applications involving discrete-time safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)-based Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna (PA), a flexible waveguide integrated with dielectric particles, intelligently reconstructs line-of-sight channels. Utilizing its geometric deterministic model and meter-level reconstruction, PA systems (PASS) are applied to uplink indoor positioning. In this paper, the uplink positioning system model for PASS is firstly proposed. A PASS-based received signal strength indication (RSSI) method is proposed to measure the distance from the users to each PA, which is efficient and suitable for PASS. PASS-based weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is designed to calculate the two-dimensional coordinates of the users. Several critical observations can be drawn from our results: i) More PAs on the waveguide improves the positioning accuracy and robustness. ii) When the number of PAs exceeds a certain threshold, the performance gain becomes marginal. iii) User locations between and near PAs yield superior positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>IDSO-Managed Bid-Based Transactive Distribution Systems Design for DER Participation in Wholesale Markets While Preserving T-D Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in bid-based Transactive Energy Systems (TES) at the distribution systems facilitates strongly coupled, bidirectional interactions between Transmission-Distribution (T-D) systems. Capturing these interactions is critical for ensuring seamless integration within an Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) framework. This study proposes a methodology to preserve such tight T-D linkages by developing an Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO) managed bid-based TES design for unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed design operates within the ITD paradigm and permits DER participation in the Wholesale Power Market (WPM) through IDSO while preserving tight T-D linkages. To this end, this research offers the following key contributions: a novel bid/offer prequalification-cum-aggregation method to ensure a grid-safe and value-based aggregation of DERs' bids and offers for WPM participation through IDSO; and a retail pricing mechanism that reflects the true value of procuring or offering additional units of power within the distribution system. Case studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 123-bus radial feeder populated with a high DER concentration to validate the proposed frameworks' effectiveness in coordinating the DERs efficiently and reliably.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Air-Ground Vehicle Operations Optimization in Hazardous Environments: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hazardous environments such as chemical spills, radiological zones, and bio-contaminated sites pose significant threats to human safety and public infrastructure. Rapid and reliable hazard mitigation in these settings often unsafe for humans, calling for autonomous systems that can adaptively sense and respond to evolving risks. This paper presents a decision-making framework for autonomous vehicle dispatch in hazardous environments with uncertain and evolving risk levels. The system integrates a Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound (BUCB) sensing strategy with task-specific vehicle routing problems with profits (VRPP), enabling adaptive coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for hazard sensing and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for cleaning. Using VRPP allows selective site visits under resource constraints by assigning each site a visit value that reflects sensing or cleaning priorities. Site-level hazard beliefs are maintained through a time-weighted Bayesian update. BUCB scores guide UAV routing to balance exploration and exploitation under uncertainty, while UGV routes are optimized to maximize expected hazard reduction under resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework reduces the number of dispatch cycles to resolve hazards by around 30% on average compared to baseline dispatch strategies, underscoring the value of uncertainty-aware vehicle dispatch for reliable hazard mitigation.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Flip-Landing Trajectories for Starship based on a Deep Learned Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a differentiable optimization framework for flip-and-landing trajectory design of reusable spacecraft, exemplified by the Starship vehicle. A deep neural network surrogate, trained on high-fidelity CFD data, predicts aerodynamic forces and moments, and is tightly coupled with a differentiable rigid-body dynamics solver. This enables end-to-end gradient-based trajectory optimization without linearization or convex relaxation. The framework handles actuator limits and terminal landing constraints, producing physically consistent, optimized control sequences. Both standard automatic differentiation and Neural ODEs are applied to support long-horizon rollouts. Results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in modeling and optimizing complex maneuvers with high nonlinearities. This work lays the groundwork for future extensions involving unsteady aerodynamics, plume interactions, and intelligent guidance design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models are essential for motion planning and control of quadruped robots, as they simplify complex dynamics while preserving critical behaviors. This paper introduces a novel methodology for deriving such interpretable dynamic models, specifically for jumping. We capture the high-dimensional, nonlinear jumping dynamics in a low-dimensional latent space by proposing a learning architecture combining Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with physical structural priors on the jump dynamics. Our approach demonstrates superior accuracy to the traditional actuated Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (aSLIP) model and is validated through simulation and hardware experiments across different jumping strategies.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Network Games: $\alpha$-Potential Function and Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a network game, players interact over a network and the utility of each player depends on his own action and on an aggregate of his neighbours' actions. Many real world networks of interest are asymmetric and involve a large number of heterogeneous players. This paper analyzes static network games using the framework of $\alpha$-potential games. Under mild assumptions on the action sets (compact intervals) and the utility functions (twice continuously differentiable) of the players, we derive an expression for an inexact potential function of the game, called the $\alpha$-potential function. Using such a function, we show that modified versions of the sequential best-response algorithm and the simultaneous gradient play algorithm achieve convergence of players' actions to a $2\alpha$-Nash equilibrium. For linear-quadratic network games, we show that $\alpha$ depends on the maximum asymmetry in the network and is well-behaved for a wide range of networks of practical interest. Further, we derive bounds on the social welfare of the $\alpha$-Nash equilibrium corresponding to the maximum of the $\alpha$-potential function, under suitable assumptions. We numerically illustrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms and properties of the learned $2\alpha$-Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Learning Causal Structure Distributions for Robust Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural causal models describe how the components of a robotic system interact. They provide both structural and functional information about the relationships that are present in the system. The structural information outlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional information describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned models. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while accounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more robust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using significantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common model-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage the sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating a causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that inform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder probabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics of a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform new tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new requirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile robots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the learned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and changes in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world robotics scenarios.

      <title>Robust-Sub-Gaussian Model Predictive Control for Safe Ultrasound-Image-Guided Robotic Spinal Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical control using high-dimensional sensory feedback from optical data (e.g., images, point clouds) poses significant challenges in domains like autonomous driving and robotic surgery. Control can rely on low-dimensional states estimated from high-dimensional data. However, the estimation errors often follow complex, unknown distributions that standard probabilistic models fail to capture, making formal safety guarantees challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel characterization of these general estimation errors using sub-Gaussian noise with bounded mean. We develop a new technique for uncertainty propagation of proposed noise characterization in linear systems, which combines robust set-based methods with the propagation of sub-Gaussian variance proxies. We further develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that provides closed-loop safety guarantees for linear systems under the proposed noise assumption. We apply this MPC approach in an ultrasound-image-guided robotic spinal surgery pipeline, which contains deep-learning-based semantic segmentation, image-based registration, high-level optimization-based planning, and low-level robotic control. To validate the pipeline, we developed a realistic simulation environment integrating real human anatomy, robot dynamics, efficient ultrasound simulation, as well as in-vivo data of breathing motion and drilling force. Evaluation results in simulation demonstrate the potential of our approach for solving complex image-guided robotic surgery task while ensuring safety.</description>

      <title>Discovery Learning accelerates battery design evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.</description>

      <title>From Data to Safe Mobile Robot Navigation: An Efficient and Modular Robust MPC Design Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful strategy for planning and control in autonomous mobile robot navigation. However, ensuring safety in real-world deployments remains challenging due to the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. Existing approaches often rely on idealized assumptions, neglect the impact of noisy measurements, and simply heuristically guess unrealistic bounds. In this work, we present an efficient and modular robust MPC design pipeline that systematically addresses these limitations. The pipeline consists of an iterative procedure that leverages closed-loop experimental data to estimate disturbance bounds and synthesize a robust output-feedback MPC scheme. We provide the pipeline in the form of deterministic and reproducible code to synthesize the robust output-feedback MPC from data. We empirically demonstrate robust constraint satisfaction and recursive feasibility in quadrotor simulations using Gazebo.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Crowd Navigation via Learning-Based Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe navigation in pedestrian-rich environments remains a key challenge for autonomous robots. This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction - reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated environments.</description>

      <title>Applying the Spectral Method for Modeling Linear Filters: Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, and Chebyshev filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new technique for computer modeling linear filters based on the spectral form of mathematical description of linear systems. It assumes that input and output signals of the filter are represented as orthogonal expansions, while filters themselves are described by two-dimensional non-stationary transfer functions. This technique allows one to model the output signal in continuous time, and it is successfully tested on the Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, and Chebyshev filters with different orders.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics in time-delay systems: polynomial $\beta$-control in a pressing process and connections to blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a press control problem in straightening machines with small time delays due to system communication. To handle this, we propose a generalized $\beta$-control method, which replaces conventional linear velocity control with a polynomial of degree $\beta \ge 1$. The resulting model is a delay differential equation (DDE), for which we derive basic properties through nondimensionalization and analysis. Numerical experiments suggest the existence of a threshold initial velocity separating overshoot and non-overshoot dynamics, which we formulate as a conjecture. Based on this, we design a control algorithm under velocity constraints and confirm its effectiveness. We also highlight a connection between threshold behavior and finite-time blow-up in DDEs. This study provides a practical control strategy and contributes new insights into threshold dynamics and blow-up phenomena in delay systems.</description>

      <title>Collision-Free Trajectory Planning and control of Robotic Manipulator using Energy-Based Artificial Potential Field (E-APF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic trajectory planning in dynamic and cluttered environments remains a critical challenge, particularly when striving for both time efficiency and motion smoothness under actuation constraints. Traditional path planner, such as Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer from local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and oscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address this limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is proposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent potential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local minima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed framework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly minimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints, ensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is validated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic manipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient, and oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the efficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle avoidance approach. This work lays the foundation for future integration with reactive control strategies and physical hardware deployment in real-world manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>SRAM-based Physically Unclonable Function using Lightweight Hamming-Code Fuzzy Extractor for Energy Harvesting Beat Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batteryless energy harvesting IoT sensor nodes such as beat sensors can be deployed in millions without the need to replace batteries. They are ultra-low-power and cost-effective wireless sensor nodes without the maintenance cost and can work for 24 hours/365 days. However, they were not equipped with security mechanisms to protect user data. Data encryption and authentication can be used to secure beat sensor applications, but generating a secure cryptographic key is challenging. In this paper, we proposed an SRAM-based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) combining a high-reliability bit selection algorithm with a lightweight error-correcting code to generate reliable secure keys for data encryption. The system employs a feature of beat sensors, in which the microcontroller is powered on to transmit the ID signals and then powered off. This fits the SRAM-based PUF requirement, which needs the SRAM to be powered off to read out its random values. The proposed system has been evaluated on STM32 Cortex M0+ microcontrollers and has been implemented to protect important data on beat sensors.</description>

      <title>Toward Goal-Oriented Communication in Multi-Agent Systems: An overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As multi-agent systems (MAS) become increasingly prevalent in autonomous systems, distributed control, and edge intelligence, efficient communication under resource constraints has emerged as a critical challenge. Traditional communication paradigms often emphasize message fidelity or bandwidth optimization, overlooking the task relevance of the exchanged information. In contrast, goal-oriented communication prioritizes the importance of information with respect to the agents' shared objectives. This review provides a comprehensive survey of goal-oriented communication in MAS, bridging perspectives from information theory, communication theory, and machine learning. We examine foundational concepts alongside learning-based approaches and emergent protocols. Special attention is given to coordination under communication constraints, as well as applications in domains such as swarm robotics, federated learning, and edge computing. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of communication theory, machine learning, and multi-agent decision making.</description>

      <title>Learning Satellite Attitude Dynamics with Physics-Informed Normalising Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks, relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete, difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data. However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased robustness-to-noise.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Navigation of Cloud-Controlled Quadcopters in Confined Spaces Using Multi-Modal Perception and LLM-Driven High Semantic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.</description>

      <title>MuaLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model Agent for Circuit Design Assistance with Hybrid Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.</description>

      <title>COMponent-Aware Pruning for Accelerated Control Tasks in Latent Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile robots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the demand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can operate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of an n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs. We prove that the widely-used Ho-Kalman algorithm and Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm are ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when n/m or n/p is large. Moreover, by analyzing the Cra\'mer-Rao bound, we derive a fundamental limit for identifying the real and stable (or marginally stable) poles of MIMO system and prove that the sample complexity for any unbiased pole estimation algorithm to reach a certain level of accuracy explodes superpolynomially with respect to n/(pm). Numerical results are provided to illustrate the ill-conditionedness of Ho-Kalman algorithm and MOESP algorithm as well as the fundamental limit on identification.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimal Coverage Control in Multi-agent Systems: Known and Unknown Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to solve the coverage optimization problem in multi-agent systems. The proposed technique offers an optimal solution with a lower cost with respect to conventional Voronoi-based techniques by effectively handling the issue of agents remaining stationary in regions void of information using a ranking function. The proposed approach leverages a novel cost function for optimizing the agents coverage and the cost function eventually aligns with the conventional Voronoi-based cost function. Theoretical analyses are conducted to assure the asymptotic convergence of agents towards the optimal configuration. A distinguishing feature of this approach lies in its departure from the reliance on geometric methods that are characteristic of Voronoi-based approaches; hence can be implemented more simply. Remarkably, the technique is adaptive and applicable to various environments with both known and unknown information distributions. Lastly, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations, and the obtained results are compared with those of Voronoi-based algorithms.</description>

We introduce Barrier Integral Control, a novel algorithm designed to confine the system's state within a predefined funnel, ensuring adherence to prescribed transient constraints, and asymptotically drive it to zero from any initial condition. The algorithm leverages the innovative integration of a reciprocal barrier function and an error-integral term, featuring smooth feedback control. Notably, it operates without relying on any information or approximation schemes for the (unknown) dynamic terms, which, unlike a large class of previous works, are not assumed to be bounded or to comply with globally Lipschitz/growth conditions. Additionally, the system's trajectory and asymptotic performance are decoupled from the uncertain model, control-gain selection, and initial conditions. Finally, comparative simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Distribution Grids May Be a Barrier To Residential Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric alternatives can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in many settings. However, residential electrification can also raise electricity demand beyond the safe limits of electrical infrastructure. This can increase the risk of blackouts or require grid reinforcement that is often slow and expensive. Here, we estimate the physical and economic impacts on distribution grids of electrifying all housing and personal vehicles in each county of the lower 48 United States. We find that space heating is the main driver of grid impacts, with the coldest regions seeing demand peaks up to five times higher than today's peaks. Accommodating electrification of all housing and personal vehicles is estimated to require 600 GW of distribution grid reinforcement nationally, at a cost of \$350 to \$790 billion, or \$2,800 to \$6,400 per household (95% confidence intervals). However, demand-side management could eliminate three-quarters of grid reinforcement costs.</description>

      <title>Distributed ADMM Approach for the Power Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical network reconfiguration problem aims to minimize losses in a distribution system by adjusting switches while ensuring radial topology. The growing use of renewable energy and the complexity of managing modern power grids make solving the reconfiguration problem crucial. Distributed algorithms help optimize grid configurations, ensuring efficient adaptation to changing conditions and better utilization of renewable energy sources. This paper introduces a distributed algorithm designed to tackle the problem of power distribution network reconfiguration with a radiality constraint. This algorithm relies on ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), where each agent progressively updates its estimation based on the information exchanged with neighboring agents. We show that every agent is required to solve a linearly constrained convex quadratic programming problem and a Minimum Weight Rooted Arborescence Problem (MWRAP) with local weights during each iteration. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios, including its application to a 33-bus test system and a real-world network.</description>

      <title>A Communication Consistent Approach to Signal Temporal Logic Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.</description>

      <title>Minimally Conservative Controlled-Invariant Set Synthesis Using Control Barrier Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a controlled-invariant set for a system with state and control constraints is crucial for safety-critical applications. However, existing methods often produce overly conservative solutions. This paper presents a method for generating controlled-invariant (safe) sets for nonlinear polynomial control-affine systems using Control Barrier Certificates (CBCs). We formulate CBC conditions as Sum-of-Squares (SOS) constraints and solve them via an SOS Program (SOSP). First, we generalize existing SOSPs for CBC synthesis to handle environments with complex unsafe state representations. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm that progressively enlarges the safe set constructed by the synthesized CBCs by maximizing boundary expansion at each iteration. We theoretically prove that our method guarantees strict safe set expansion at every step. Finally, we validate our approach with numerical simulations in 2D and 3D for single-input and multi-input systems. Empirical results show that the safe set generated by our method covers in most part a larger portion of the state space compared to two state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates extremum seeking control for a torque-controlled antenna pointing system without direct angular measurements. We consider a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) antenna system that receives an unknown signal from its environment, where the signal strength varies with the antenna orientation. It is assumed that only real-time measurements of the signal are available. We develop an extremum seeking control strategy that enables the antenna to autonomously adjust its direction to maximize the received signal strength based on the symmetric product approximation. Under suitable assumptions on the signal function, we prove local practical uniform asymptotic stability for the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>A Practical Approach Towards Inertia Estimation Using Ambient Synchrophasor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time tracking of inertia is important because it reflects the power system's ability to withstand contingencies and maintain frequency security. This paper proposes a practical approach to estimate inertia using ambient phasor measurement unit (PMU) data and a partitioned form of the swing equation. The approach accounts for (bounded) uncertainties in network parameters and PMU measurements, enabling precise estimation of inertia and damping constants, as well as mechanical power inputs. Instead of assuming constant mechanical power input throughout, the approach leverages knowledge of power system operations to determine intervals when it is actually constant to maintain estimation consistency. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus system and IEEE 39 bus system integrated with renewable energy sources affirm the method's accuracy and applicability.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the new concepts of Functional Controllability and Functional Stabilizability, and establishes their duality with Functional Observability and Functional Detectability, respectively. A Generalized Separation Principle is presented, under which the classical Separation Principle emerges as a special case. Conditions for the existence of functional controllers of a specified order are derived. Notably, the proposed design framework does not require full controllability. In addition, a functional observer-based controller design is developed for systems that may be both uncontrollable and unobservable. The results presented extend and generalize the classical full-state observer based feedback control paradigm.</description>

      <title>Gait Transitions in Load-Pulling Quadrupeds: Insights from Sled Dogs and a Minimal SLIP Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal animals employ diverse galloping strategies to optimize speed, stability, and energy efficiency. However, the biomechanical mechanisms that enable adaptive gait transitions during high-speed locomotion under load remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new empirical and modeling insights into the biomechanics of load-pulling quadrupeds, using sprint sled dogs as a model system. High-speed video and force recordings reveal that sled dogs often switch between rotary and transverse galloping gaits within just a few strides and without any observable changes in speed, stride duration, or terrain, providing clear evidence of locomotor multistability during high-speed load-pulling. To investigate the mechanical basis of these transitions, a physics-based quadrupedal Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model with hybrid dynamics and prescribed footfall sequences to reproduce the asymmetric galloping patterns observed in racing sled dogs. Through trajectory optimization, we replicate experimentally observed gait sequences and identify swing-leg stiffness modulation as a key control mechanism for inducing transitions. This work provides a much-needed biomechanical perspective on high-speed animal draft and establishes a modeling framework for studying locomotion in pulling quadrupeds, with implications for both biological understanding and the design of adaptive legged systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of an Active Car Suspension with a Robust LQR Controller under Road Disturbance, Parameter Uncertainty and White Noise</title>

Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system increases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely, and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. A passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost, and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR-controlled active suspension was designed than a passive suspension and a PID-controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID-controlled active suspension, and LQR-controlled active suspension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration, and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all three suspensions under road disturbance, under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty and under road disturbance with white noise. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the rise time, overshoot, and settling time data of the suspensions under different conditions. It was observed that the LQR-controlled active suspension showed the fastest rise time, the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQRcontrolled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control the latent activity of a circuit would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. We simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. The fields of classical and optimal control offer a range of methods to choose from for controlling dynamics on the neural manifold, which differ in performance, computational cost, and ease of implementation. Here, we focus on two commonly used control methods: proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC). PID is a computationally lightweight controller that is simple to implement. In contrast, MPC is a model-based, anticipatory controller with a much higher computational cost and engineering overhead. We evaluate both methods on trajectory-following tasks in latent space, under partial observability and in the presence of unknown noise. While both controllers in some cases were able to successfully control the latent dynamics on the neural manifold, MPC consistently produced more accurate control and required less hyperparameter tuning. These results demonstrate how MPC can be applied on the neural manifold using data-driven dynamics models, and provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and external stimuli.</description>

      <title>Mean--Variance Portfolio Selection by Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms, Regret Analysis, and Empirical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time mean--variance portfolio selection in markets where stock prices are diffusion processes driven by observable factors that are also diffusion processes, yet the coefficients of these processes are unknown. Based on the recently developed reinforcement learning (RL) theory for diffusion processes, we present a general data-driven RL algorithm that learns the pre-committed investment strategy directly without attempting to learn or estimate the market coefficients. For multi-stock Black--Scholes markets without factors, we further devise a baseline algorithm and prove its performance guarantee by deriving a sublinear regret bound in terms of the Sharpe ratio. For performance enhancement and practical implementation, we modify the baseline algorithm and carry out an extensive empirical study to compare its performance, in terms of a host of common metrics, with a large number of widely employed portfolio allocation strategies on S\&amp;P 500 constituents. The results demonstrate that the proposed continuous-time RL strategy is consistently among the best, especially in a volatile bear market, and decisively outperforms the model-based continuous-time counterparts by significant margins.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the construction of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, ubiquitous connectivity has been achieved. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are mainly deployed in specific urban areas and use licensed spectrum. However, in remote areas where terrestrial infrastructure is sparse, licensed spectrum bands are often underutilized. To accommodate the increasing communication needs, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) can opportunistically access this idle spectrum to improve spectrum efficiency via spectrum sharing (SS). Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. In satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to manage mutual interference between NTN and TN effectively. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of SS in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in decentralized control of POMDPs: A control-theoretic view of the Mermin-Peres square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems.

      <title>Heisenberg-limited calibration of entangling gates with robust phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calibration of high-quality two-qubit entangling gates is an essential component in engineering large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, many standard calibration techniques are based on randomized circuits that are only quadratically sensitive to calibration errors. As a result, these approaches are inefficient, requiring many experimental shots to achieve acceptable performance. In this work, we demonstrate that robust phase estimation can enable high-precision, Heisenberg-limited estimates of coherent errors in multi-qubit gates. Equipped with an efficient estimator, the calibration problem may be reduced to a simple optimization loop that minimizes the estimated coherent error. We experimentally demonstrate our calibration protocols by improving the operation of a two-qubit controlled-Z gate on a superconducting processor, and we validate the improved performance with gate set tomography. Our methods are applicable to gates in other quantum hardware platforms such as ion traps and neutral atoms, and on other multi-qubit gates, such as CNOT or iSWAP.</description>

      <title>Elastic Motion Policy: An Adaptive Dynamical System for Robust and Efficient One-Shot Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) has become a staple imitation learning paradigm in robotics due to its ease of teaching robots complex skills directly from expert demonstrations. However, BC suffers from an inherent generalization issue. To solve this, the status quo solution is to gather more data. Yet, regardless of how much training data is available, out-of-distribution performance is still sub-par, lacks any formal guarantee of convergence and success, and is incapable of allowing and recovering from physical interactions with humans. These are critical flaws when robots are deployed in ever-changing human-centric environments. Thus, we propose Elastic Motion Policy (EMP), a one-shot imitation learning framework that allows robots to adjust their behavior based on the scene change while respecting the task specification. Trained from a single demonstration, EMP follows the dynamical systems paradigm where motion planning and control are governed by first-order differential equations with convergence guarantees. We leverage Laplacian editing in full end-effector space, $\mathbb{R}^3\times SO(3)$, and online convex learning of Lyapunov functions, to adapt EMP online to new contexts, avoiding the need to collect new demonstrations. We extensively validate our framework in real robot experiments, demonstrating its robust and efficient performance in dynamic environments, with obstacle avoidance and multi-step task capabilities.

      <title>Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.</description>

      <title>Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Step-by-step Guide on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Safe Mobile Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a model predictive control (MPC) scheme that enables a mobile robot to safely navigate through an obstacle-filled environment is a complicated yet essential task in robotics. In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements. Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC (LMPC), NMPC, and their applications in various domains, including robotics. This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation. The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations and real-world robotic applications.

      <title>EngiBench: A Framework for Data-Driven Engineering Design Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes, topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more -- that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks, and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained design manifolds.</description>
