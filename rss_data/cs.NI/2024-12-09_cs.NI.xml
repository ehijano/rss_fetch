      <title>Performance Evaluation of LoRa Technology for Rural Connectivity: An Experimental Analysis in Nepal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRa technology has garnered significant interest in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) field in recent years due to its ability to operate at low power while maintaining effective communication. Despite gaining attention, LoRa technology faces challenges in effectively facilitating communication in rural settings due to specific transmission and reception conditions. This research paper provides an in-depth analysis of using a LoRa mesh network that accesses the performance of different LoRa configurations by varying parameters like Bandwidth (BW), Spreading Factor (SF), and Coding Rate (CR). Metrics, like the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR), and packet loss, are analyzed to check the optimal configurations for LoRa nodes, specifically in the context of rural areas of Nepal. Furthermore, the varying propagation loss concerning the change in physical layer parameters is also discussed. The experimental setup utilizes Arduino Uno and ESP 32 microcontroller boards with LoRa modules to build the transmitter and receiver nodes, which are paired with a self-constructed monopole antenna, showing superior gain compared to commercially available options. This paper also explores the potential of integrating the acquired data with cloud platforms such as ThingSpeak. This integration establishes a strong backbone for the Internet of Things (IoT), which can gather and analyze remote data, providing the capacity for remote access to the data. This paper finally recommends specific values for the examined parameters for the specific case of a particular type of hilly and mountainous terrain in a country like Nepal, keeping in mind the unique trade-offs each one offers, thereby enabling optimal rural wireless communication.</description>

      <title>DRDST: Low-latency DAG Consensus through Robust Dynamic Sharding and Tree-broadcasting for IoV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is emerging as a pivotal technology for enhancing traffic management and safety. Its rapid development demands solutions for enhanced communication efficiency and reduced latency. However, traditional centralized networks struggle to meet these demands, prompting the exploration of decentralized solutions such as blockchain. Addressing blockchain's scalability challenges posed by the growing number of nodes and transactions calls for innovative solutions, among which sharding stands out as a pivotal approach to significantly enhance blockchain throughput. However, existing schemes still face challenges related to a) the impact of vehicle mobility on blockchain consensus, especially for cross-shard transaction; and b) the strict requirements of low latency consensus in a highly dynamic network. In this paper, we propose a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) consensus leveraging Robust Dynamic Sharding and Tree-broadcasting (DRDST) to address these challenges. Specifically, we first develop a standard for evaluating the network stability of nodes, combined with the nodes' trust values, to propose a novel robust sharding model that is solved through the design of the Genetic Sharding Algorithm (GSA). Then, we optimize the broadcast latency of the whole sharded network by improving the tree-broadcasting to minimize the maximum broadcast latency within each shard. On this basis, we also design a DAG consensus scheme based on an improved hashgraph protocol, which can efficiently handle cross-shard transactions. Finally, the simulation proves the proposed scheme is superior to the comparison schemes in latency, throughput, consensus success rate, and node traffic load.</description>

      <title>WRF-GS: Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a longstanding challenge. This issue has been escalated due to the denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and wider bandwidth in 5G and beyond networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate that WRF-GS outperforms existing methods for spatial spectrum synthesis, such as ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Moreover, WRF-GS achieves superior performance in the channel state information prediction task, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin of more than 2.43 dB.</description>

      <title>Location-Driven Programmable Wireless Environments through Light-emitting RIS (LeRIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G wireless networks seek to enable robust and dynamic programmable wireless environments (PWEs), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a cornerstone for controlling electromagnetic wave propagation. However, realizing the potential of RISs for demanding PWE applications depends on precise and real-time user localization, especially in scenarios with random receiver orientations and inherent hardware imperfections. To address this challenge, we propose a novel optical localization framework that integrates conventional ceiling-mounted LEDs with light-emitting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (LeRISs). By leveraging the spatial diversity offered by the LeRIS architecture, the framework introduces robust signal paths that improve localization accuracy and reduce errors under varying orientations. To this end, we derive a system of equations for received signal strength-based localization that accounts for random receiver orientations and imposes spatial constraints on LED placement, ensuring unique and reliable solutions. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves precise beam control and high spectral efficiency even for RISs with large number of reflecting elements, establishing our solution as scalable and adaptive for PWEs that require real-time accuracy and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Gesture Tracking System Utilizing Frequency-Hopping RFID Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gesture tracking technology provides users with a hands free interactive experience without the need to hold or touch devices. However, current gesture tracking research has primarily focused on tracking accuracy while neglecting issues of user privacy protection and security. This study aims to develop a gesture tracking system based on frequency hopping RFID signals that effectively protects user privacy without compromising tracking efficiency and accuracy. By introducing frequency hopping technology, we have designed a mechanism that prevents potential eavesdroppers from obtaining raw RFID signals, thereby enhancing the systems privacy protection capabilities. The system architec ture includes the collection of RFID signals, data processing, signal recovery, and gesture tracking. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves privacy protection levels while maintaining real time and accuracy. This research not only provides a new perspective for the field of gesture tracking but also offers valuable insights for the use of RFID technology in privacy-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating an Effective Ransomware Infection Vector in Low Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) and satellite systems have become an important component of modern data communication systems in recent years. Despite their importance, the security of these systems is often limited, leaving them vulnerable to determined attackers. In this paper, we outline a scenario in which an attacker can infect an in-orbit NASA Core Flight System (cFS) based satellite with ransomware and communicate the infection back to a satellite operator. This paper is the first to demonstrate an end-to-end exploit path that results in a ransomware infection without the need for a supply chain attack or compromised credentials. Novel ransomware is delivered to an emulated satellite system using custom shellcode that exploits a weakness in the considered scenario. The scenario considered by this initial piece of work achieves a success rate of 33.3\% for a complete successful infection.</description>

      <title>NebulaFL: Effective Asynchronous Federated Learning for JointCloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advancements in AI infrastructure and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology, Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS) through JointCloud Computing (JCC) is promising to break through the resource constraints caused by heterogeneous edge devices in the traditional Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Specifically, with the protection from TEE, data owners can achieve efficient model training with high-performance AI services in the cloud. By providing additional FL services, cloud service providers can achieve collaborative learning among data owners. However, FLaaS still faces three challenges, i.e., i) low training performance caused by heterogeneous data among data owners, ii) high communication overhead among different clouds (i.e., data centers), and iii) lack of efficient resource scheduling strategies to balance training time and cost. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel asynchronous FL approach named NebulaFL for collaborative model training among multiple clouds. To address data heterogeneity issues, NebulaFL adopts a version control-based asynchronous FL training scheme in each data center to balance training time among data owners. To reduce communication overhead, NebulaFL adopts a decentralized model rotation mechanism to achieve effective knowledge sharing among data centers. To balance training time and cost, NebulaFL integrates a reward-guided strategy for data owners selection and resource scheduling. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art FL methods, NebulaFL can achieve up to 5.71\% accuracy improvement. In addition, NebulaFL can reduce up to 50% communication overhead and 61.94% costs under a target accuracy.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Complex Networks with AI-Driven Adaptive Nodes for Optimized Connectivity and Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High connectivity and robustness are critical requirements in distributed networks, as they ensure resilience, efficient communication, and adaptability in dynamic environments. Additionally, optimizing energy consumption is also paramount for ensuring sustainability of networks composed of energy-constrained devices and prolonging their operational lifespan. In this study, we introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced self-organizing network model, where each adaptive node autonomously adjusts its transmission power to optimize network connectivity and redundancy while lowering energy consumption. Building on our previous Hamiltonian-based methodology, which is designed to lead networks toward globally optimized states of complete connectivity and minimal energy usage, this research integrates a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based decision-making model at each node. By leveraging a dataset from the Hamiltonian approach, each node independently learns and adapts its transmission power in response to local conditions, resulting in emergent global behaviors marked by high connectivity and resilience against structural disruptions. This distributed, MLP-driven adaptability allows nodes to make context-aware power adjustments autonomously, enabling the network to maintain its optimized state over time. Simulation results show that the proposed AI-driven adaptive nodes collectively achieve stable complete connectivity, significant robustness, and optimized energy usage under various conditions, including static and mobile network scenarios. This work contributes to the growing field of self-organizing networks by illustrating the potential of AI to enhance complex network design, supporting the development of scalable, resilient, and energy-efficient distributed systems across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Caching at Network Edge: Classification, Solutions, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>Intent-based Meta-Scheduling in Programmable Networks: A Research Agenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called ''programmable'' networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement. Any requirements on such a network would need to be formally specified via intents, which can represent user requirements in a formal yet understandable manner. Meeting the user requirements via intents would necessitate the rapid implementation of resource allocation and scheduling in the network. Also, given the expected size and geographical distribution of programmable networks, multiple resource scheduling implementations would need to be implemented at the same time. This would necessitate the use of a meta-scheduler that can coordinate the various schedulers and dynamically ensure optimal resource scheduling across the network.
  To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling in programmable networks. Our research agenda will be built on active inference, a type of causal inference. Active inference provides some level of autonomy to each scheduler while the meta-scheduler takes care of overall intent fulfillment. Our research agenda will comprise a strawman architecture for meta-scheduling and a set of research questions that need to be addressed to make intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling a reality.</description>
