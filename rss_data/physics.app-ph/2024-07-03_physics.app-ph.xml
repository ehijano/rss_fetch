      <title>Evolution of performance parameters of perovskite solar cells with current-voltage scan frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-voltage measurements are a standard testing protocol to determine the efficiency of any solar cell. However, perovskite solar cells display significant kinetic phenomena that modify the performance at several time scales, due to hysteresis, internal capacitances, and related mechanisms. Here, we develop a method to analyze the current-voltage curves by using large amplitude sinusoids as the excitation waveforms, specifically addressed to determine the influence of cycling frequency on the performance parameters. We solve a system of equations representative of charge collection and recombination, that provide the frequency-dependent dynamical behavior of the internal ion-controlled surface recombination processes that cause open-circuit voltage variations often observed in high performance devices. We analyze several reported experimental data, and we feature the key parameters governing the evolution of hysteresis phenomena as the scan speed is increased in relation to Impedance Spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Selective Loading of a Micrometer-Scale Particle into a Magneto-Gravitational Trap by Sublimation-Activated Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a technique for selectively loading a particle into a magneto-gravitational trap using the sublimation of camphor to release particles from a tungsten probe tip directly into the trapping region. This sublimation-activated release (SAR) loading technique makes use of micropositioners with tungsten probe tips, as well as the relatively fast rate of sublimation of camphor at room temperature, to selectively load particles having diameters ranging from $\SI{8}{\micro \meter}$ to $\SI{100}{\micro \meter}$ or more. The advantages of this method include its ability to selectively load unique particles or particles in limited supply, its low loss compared to alternative techniques, the low speed of the particle when released, and the versatility of its design which allows for loading into traps with complex geometries. SAR is demonstrated here by loading a particle into a magneto-gravitational trap, but the technique could also be applicable to other levitated optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Ar$\chi$i-Textile Composites: Role of Weave Architecture on Mode-I Fracture Toughness in Woven Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of weave architectures on the mechanics of crack propagation in fiber-reinforced woven polymer composites under quasi-static loading. Woven composites consist of fabrics containing fibers interwoven at 0 degrees (warp) and 90 degrees (weft) bound by a polymer matrix. The mechanical properties can be tuned by weaving fiber bundles with single or multiple materials in various patterns or architectures. Although the effects of uniform weave architectures, like plain, twill, satin, etc. on in-plane modulus and fracture toughness have been studied, the influence of patterned weaves consisting of a combination of sub-patterns, that is, architected weaves, on these behaviors is not understood. We focus on identifying the mechanisms affecting crack path tortuosity and propagation rate in architected weave composites containing various sub-patterns. Through compact tension tests, we determine how architected weave patterns compared to uniform weaves influence mode-I fracture toughness of woven composites due to interactions of different failure modes. Results show that fracture toughness increases at transition regions between sub-patterns in architected weave composites, with more tortuous crack propagation and higher resistance to crack growth than uniform weave composites. We also introduce three geometrical parameters transition, area, and skewness factors to characterize sub-patterns and their effects on in-plane fracture toughness. This knowledge can be exploited to design and fabricate safer lightweight structures for marine and aerospace sectors with enhanced damage tolerance under extreme loads.</description>

      <title>Machine learning driven high-resolution Raman spectral generation for accurate molecular feature recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the probing of light-matter interactions, Raman spectroscopy provides invaluable insights into the composition, structure, and dynamics of materials, and obtaining such data from portable and cheap instruments is of immense practical relevance. Here, we propose the integration of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with low-resolution Raman spectroscopy with a portable hand-held spectrometer to facilitate concurrent spectral analysis and compound classification. Portable spectrometers generally have a lower resolution, and the Raman signal is usually buried under the background noise. The GAN-based model could not only generate high-resolution data but also reduced the spectral noise significantly. The generated data was used further to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based model for the classification of organic and pharmaceutical drug molecules. The high-resolution generated Raman data was subsequently used for spectral barcoding for identification of the pharmaceutical drugs. GAN also demonstrated enhanced robustness in extracting weak signals compared to conventional noise removal methods. This integrated system holds the potential for achieving accurate and real-time monitoring of noisy inputs to obtain high throughput output, thereby opening new avenues for applications in different domains. This synergy between spectroscopy and machine learning (ML) facilitates improved data processing, noise reduction, and feature extraction and opens avenues for predictive modeling and automated decision-making using cost-effective portable devices.</description>

Abstract: We designed a multilayered self-adaptive absorber/emitter metamaterial, which can smartly switch between a solar absorber and a radiative cooler based on temperature change. The switching capability is facilitated by the phase change material and the structure is optimized by machine learning. Our design not only advances the machine-learning-based development of metamaterials but also has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions and contribute to the goal of achieving carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Dynamics in Helium Ion Injection onto Tungsten Surfaces by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a machine-learning approach for globally calibrating the large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beamsplitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Hypermultiplexed off-chip hologram by on-chip integrated metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The waveguide-integrated metasurface introduces a novel photonic chip capable of converting guided modes into free-space light. This enables functions such as off-chip beam focusing, steering, and imaging. The challenge lies in achieving hypermultiplexing across diverse parameters, including guided-wave mode type, direction, polarization, and notably, multiple wavelengths. Here, we introduce a comprehensive end-to-end inverse design framework, rooted in a physical model, for the multifunctional design of on-chip metasurfaces. This framework allows for metasurface optimization through a target-field-driven iteration process. We demonstrate a hypermultiplexed on-chip metasurface capable of generating red-green-blue holograms at multiple target planes, with both independent and cooperative control over guided-wave direction. Significantly, the proposed method streamlines the design process utilizing only the positions of meta-atoms as the design variable. We demonstrate 9 independent holographic channels through a combination of wavelength and distance multiplexing. Moreover, by incorporating the excitation direction into the design, the metasurface produces a total of 36 distinct holograms. The robustness of these results against fabrication discrepancies is validated through 3D full-wave electromagnetic simulations, aligning well with advanced manufacturing techniques. Our research presents a universal design framework for the development of multifunctional on-chip metasurfaces, opening up new avenues for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>From design to device: challenges and opportunities in computational discovery of p-type transparent conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-performance p-type transparent conductor (TC) does not yet exist, but could lead to advances in a wide range of optoelectronic applications and enable new architectures for, e.g., next-generation photovoltaic (PV) devices. High-throughput computational material screenings have been a promising approach to filter databases and identify new p-type TC candidates, and some of these predictions have been experimentally validated. However, most of these predicted candidates do not have experimentally-achieved properties on par with n-type TCs used in solar cells, and therefore have not yet been used in commercial devices. Thus, there is still a significant divide between transforming predictions into results that are actually achievable in the lab, and an even greater lag in scaling predicted materials into functional devices. In this perspective, we outline some of the major disconnects in this materials discovery process -- from scaling computational predictions into synthesizable crystals and thin films in the laboratory, to scaling lab-grown films into real-world solar devices -- and share insights to inform future strategies for TC discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Electron transporting bilayers for perovskite solar cells: spray coating deposition of c-TiO2/m-SnO2-quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein we present a comparative study among different mesoporous electron transporter layers (ETLs), namely nanometric m-TiO2, m-SnO2 and m-SnO2 quantum dots (QDs), deposited by spray coating method. The experimental data correlated with the photovoltaic parameters indicate that the SnO2 mesoporous layer obtained from the spray deposition of the in-house prepared QDs solution is the best candidate between the three used mesoporous ETLs. The use of the in-house prepared SnO2 QDs solution presents smaller agglomerates composed of 3 nm NPs resulting in the formation of a thinner, more uniform, and compact mesoporous ETL, compared with the other two ETL solutions. The formamidinium-methylamonium-potassium (FAMA@10K) perovskite deposited on this m-SnO2 QDs ETL presents a lower RMS, more uniformity and, a higher amount of PbI2. Interestingly, this higher concentration for PbI2 seems to enhance the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSC), compared to the other two mesoporous ETLs. Our work reveals that SnO2 QDs solution can be easily produced in the laboratory and it is more suited for the deposition of the mesoporous ETL when choosing a FAMA@10K configuration perovskite solar cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 10%.</description>

Abstract: The commercially available 4000-Watt continuous-wave Erbium-doped-fiber laser, emitting at the 1567-nanometer wavelength where the atmosphere has high transmission, provides an opportunity for harvesting electric power at remote off the grid locations using a multi-module photovoltaic receiver panel. This paper proposes a 32-element monocrystalline thick-layer Germanium photovoltaic panel for efficient harvesting of a collimated 1.13-meter-diameter beam.The 0.78-meter squared PV panel is constructed from commercial Ge wafers. For incident continuous-wave laser-beam power in the 4000 to 10000 Watt range, our thermal and electrical and infrared simulations predict 660 to 1510 Watts of electrical output at panel temperatures of 350 to 423 Kelvin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-performance photonic switches are essential for large-scale optical routing for AI large models and Internet of things. Realizing nonvolatility can further reduce power consumption and expand application scenarios. We propose a nonvolatile 2*2 silicon photonic micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switch compatible with standard silicon photonic foundry processes. The switch employs electrostatic comb actuator to change the air gap of the compact horizontal adiabatic coupler and achieves nonvolatility with centrally-clamped stepped bistable mechanical beams. The photonic switch features a 10s us-scale switching speed and a 10s fJ-scale simulated switching energy within a 100*100 um2 footprint, with &lt;=26 V driving voltages. This 2*2 switch can be used in a variety of topologies for large-scale photonic switches, and its nonvolatility can potentially support future photonic FPGA designs.</description>

      <title>Analytic Approximation of Free-Space Path Loss for Implanted Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implantable wireless bioelectronic devices enable communication and/or power transfer through RF wireless connections with external nodes. These devices encounter notable design challenges due to the lossy nature of the host body, which significantly diminishes the radiation efficiency of the implanted antenna and tightens the wireless link budget. Prior research has yielded closed-form approximate expressions for estimating losses occurring within the lossy host body, known as the in-body path loss. To assess the total path loss between the implanted transmitter and external receiver, this paper focuses on the free-space path loss of the implanted antenna, from the body-air interface to the external node. This is not trivial, as in addition to the inherent radial spreading of spherical electromagnetic waves common to all antennas, implanted antennas confront additional losses arising from electromagnetic scattering at the interface between the host body and air. Employing analytical modeling, we propose closed-form approximate expressions for estimating this free-space path loss. The approximation is formulated as a function of the free-space distance, the curvature radius of the body-air interface, the depth of the implanted antenna, and the permittivity of the lossy medium. This proposed method undergoes thorough validation through numerical calculations, simulations, and measurements for different implanted antenna scenarios. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the path loss in implanted antennas and provides a reliable analytical framework for their efficient design and performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-foundry-fabricated piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuit platform for ultraviolet and blue wavelengths, using alumina waveguides that are strongly mechanically coupled to monolithically integrated aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators. Low waveguide losses are measured down to at least 320 nm, where we achieve 1.6 dB/cm. This allows us to demonstrate broadband amplitude modulators based on piezoelectrically actuated MEMS cantilever phase-shifters down to 320 nm, with a high extinction ratio of 30 dB. We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform by designing and demonstrating a modulator that can work with high extinction and low loss at 320 nm and 420 nm, simultaneously, demonstrating control of multiple, disparate wavelengths in one device. We also demonstrate narrow-band resonant racetrack modulators with quality factors of 4.7E5 and a tuning rate of 27.5 MHz/V. These results should open doors for a range of novel applications in UV photonics, quantum science, sensing and spectroscopy.</description>
