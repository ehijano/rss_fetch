      <title>Search for Primordial Black Holes from the International Space Station with the SQM-ISS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the observational capabilities and sensitivity of the SQM-ISS detector to primordial black holes. The SQM-ISS experiment aims to detect slow, non relativistic massive particles within cosmic rays, using a detector on board the International Space Station. The device is designed to recognize the passage of highly penetrating and dense particles in a wide range of mass and charge states such as Strange Quark Matter (SQM). These particles, traveling at speeds typical of gravitationally bound objects in the galaxy - around 250 km/s - are also possible candidates of dark matter. The ability of SQM-ISS to identify penetrating, massive and slow-moving objects allows it also to be sensitive to the detection of primordial black holes. We discuss how black holes, traveling through the detector at velocities compatible with galactic orbital speeds, can be identified based on their interaction signatures.</description>

      <title>On the calculation of p-values for quadratic statistics in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) projects have reported various lines of evidence suggesting the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background in their data. One key line of evidence involves a detection statistic sensitive to inter-pulsar correlations, such as those induced by GWs. A $p$-value is then calculated to assess how unlikely it is for the observed signal to arise under the null hypothesis $H_0$, purely by chance. However, PTAs cannot empirically draw samples from $H_0$. As a workaround, various techniques are used in the literature to approximate $p$-values under $H_0$. One such technique, which has been heralded as a model-independent method, is the use of ``scrambling'' transformations that modify the data to cancel out pulsar correlations, thereby simulating realizations from $H_0$. In this work, scrambling methods and the detection statistic are investigated from first principles. The $p$-value methodology that is discussed is general, but the discussions regarding a specific detection statistic apply to the detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves with PTAs. All methods in the literature to calculate $p$-values for such a detection statistic are rigorously analyzed, and many analytical expressions are derived. All this leads to the conclusion that scrambling methods are \emph{not} model-independent and thus not completely empirical. Rigorous Bayesian and Frequentist $p$-value calculation methods are advocated, the evaluation of which depend on the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution. This view is consistent with the posterior predictive $p$-value approach that is already in the literature. Efficient expressions are derived to evaluate the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution of the detection statistic on real data. It is highlighted that no Frequentist $p$-values have been calculated correctly in the PTA literature to date.</description>

      <title>Generative Models of 21cm EoR Lightcones with 3D Scattering Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is observed as a three-dimensional data set known as a lightcone, consisting of a redshift (frequency) axis and two spatial sky plane axes. When observed by radio interferometers, this EoR signal is strongly obscured by foregrounds that are several orders of magnitude stronger. Due to its inherently non-Gaussian nature, the EoR signal requires robust statistical tools to accurately separate it from these foreground contaminants, but current foreground separation techniques focus primarily on recovering the EoR power spectrum, often neglecting valuable non-Gaussian information. Recent developments in astrophysics, particularly in the context of the Galactic interstellar medium, have demonstrated the efficacy of scattering transforms - novel summary statistics for highly non-Gaussian processes - for component separation tasks. Motivated by these advances, we extend the scattering transform formalism from two-dimensional data sets to three-dimensional EoR lightcones. To this end, we introduce a 3D wavelet set from the tensor product of 2D isotropic wavelets in the sky plane domain and 1D wavelets in the redshift domain. As generative models form the basis of component separation, our focus here is on building and validating generative models that can be used for component separation in future projects. To achieve this, we construct maximum entropy generative models to synthesise EoR lightcones, and statistically validate the generative model by quantitatively comparing the synthesised EoR lightcones with the single target lightcone used to construct them, using independent statistics such as the power spectrum and Minkowski Functionals. The synthesised lightcones agree well with the target lightcone both statistically and visually, opening up the possibility of developing for component separation methods using 3D scattering transforms.</description>

      <title>On the Earth's tidal perturbations. II. LARES 2 satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-ranging satellites have proved their efficiency in high precision testing of General Relativity and constraining modified gravity theories proposed to explain the dark sector and the cosmological tensions. The LARES 2 satellite launched in 2022, is currently providing improved information regarding the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity, as well as the geodesy, thus essentially complementing the data of already existing laser-ranging satellites. The proper knowledge of the Earth's tidal perturbation modes is essential for accurately extracting the sought frame-dragging signal. We present the results of computation of 110 significant modes in Doodson number classification for the parameters of LARES 2 satellite, continuing our previous study on those obtained for the LARES satellite.</description>

      <title>A Visibility-based 21 cm Bispectrum Estimator for Radio-interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast and scalable estimator for the binned multi-frequency angular bispectrum (MABS) and the 3D bispectrum (BS) of the redshifted 21 cm signal from radio interferometric observations. The estimator operates on gridded visibilities and leverages the FFT-based acceleration to efficiently compute the MABS and the 3D BS covering all possible triangle configurations. We present the formalism and validate the estimator using simulated visibility data for a known input model BS, considering the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations with a bandwidth of $30.72$ MHz centered at $154.25$ MHz. We consider two cases, namely, without flagging, and with flagging, which has exactly the same frequency channels flagged as the actual data. We obtain estimates of the BS for a wide range of triangle shapes covering the scales $0.003 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\leq k_1 \leq 1.258 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The estimated BS shows excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the input model BS. We find that the deviations, which are below 20\% even in the presence of flagging, are mostly consistent with the expected statistical fluctuations. This work paves the way for reliable observational estimates of the 21 cm BS for the epoch of reionization, where the signal is predicted to be highly non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>On the use and interpretation of signal-model indistinguishability measures for gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difference ("mismatch") between two gravitational-wave (GW) signals is often used to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which they will be distinguishable in a measurement or, alternatively, when the errors in a signal model will lead to biased measurements. It is well known that the standard approach to calculate this "indistinguishability SNR" is too conservative: a model may fail the criterion at a given SNR, but not necessarily incur a biased measurement of any individual parameters. This problem can be solved by taking into account errors orthogonal to the model space (which therefore do not induce a bias), and calculating indistinguishability SNRs for individual parameters, rather than the full $N$-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate this approach with the simple example of aligned-spin binary-black-hole signals, and calculate accurate estimates of the SNR at which each parameter measurement will be biased. In general biases occur at much higher SNRs than predicted from the standard mismatch calculation. Which parameters are most easily biased depends sensitively on the details of a given waveform model, and the location in parameter space, and in some cases the bias SNR is as high as the conservative estimate. We also illustrate how the parameter bias SNR can be used to robustly specify waveform accuracy requirements for future detectors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Numerical tests of cosmological Alfv\'en waves with Ohmic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical problems with a solution that can be expressed analytically are scarce; this holds even more true for problems set in a cosmological context. Such solutions are, however, invaluable tools for making comparisons between theory, numerical experimentation and observations. In this work we present what to our knowledge is the first set of non-trivial closed-form expressions describing the behaviour of a system governed by the equations of non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effects of Ohmic diffusion are considered, in a cosmologically expanding frame. We provide analytical solutions that describe the time evolution of linear perturbations to a homogeneous background in a radiation-dominated universe, yielding dissipative Alfv\'en waves. Although in our base framework solutions for any other cosmology of interest cannot be expressed in a closed form, they can still be obtained reliably through numerical integration of the coupled system of ordinary differential equations we provide. We compare our analytical solutions to numerical results obtained using our novel implementation of Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) in the SWIFT astrophysical simulation code, to find good agreement between the two. We find the code to display good convergence behaviour, its predictions agreeing with theory to within 0.1% for a modest number of resolution elements and at a negligible computational cost. We aim this work as a companion and supplement to the cosmological ideal MHD wave tests recently presented in the literature, and suggest that it be adopted as part of standard testing of code implementations of MHD.</description>

      <title>Detectability of massive binary black holes with sub-mHz gravitational wave missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences. Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We evaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and precessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes. These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations, thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</description>

Abstract: The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based Cosmic-Ray (CR) observatory with the aim, among others, to study Cosmic-Ray Electrons (CREs) up to 10 TeV. Due to the low CRE rate at multi-TeV energies, we aim to increasing the acceptance by selecting events outside the fiducial volume. The complex topology of non-fiducial events requires the development of a novel energy reconstruction method. We propose the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks for a regression task to recover an accurate estimation of the initial energy.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the LSST Solar System Yield: Near-Earth Objects, Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a new 8m-class survey facility presently being commissioned in Chile, expected to begin the 10yr-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the end of 2025. Using the purpose-built Sorcha survey simulator (Merritt et al. In Press), and near-final observing cadence, we perform the first high-fidelity simulation of LSST's solar system catalog for key small body populations. We show that the final LSST catalog will deliver over 1.1 billion observations of small bodies and raise the number of known objects to 1.27E5 near-Earth objects, 5.09E6 main belt asteroids, 1.09E5 Jupiter Trojans, and 3.70E4 trans-Neptunian objects. These represent 4-9x more objects than are presently known in each class, making LSST the largest source of data for small body science in this and the following decade. We characterize the measurements available for these populations, including orbits, griz colors, and lightcurves, and point out science opportunities they open. Importantly, we show that ~70% of the main asteroid belt and more distant populations will be discovered in the first two years of the survey, making high-impact solar system science possible from very early on. We make our simulated LSST catalog publicly available, allowing researchers to test their methods on an up-to-date, representative, full-scale simulation of LSST data.</description>
