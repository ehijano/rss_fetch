      <title>Deep Mamba Multi-modal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the excellent performance of Mamba networks, we propose a novel Deep Mamba Multi-modal Learning (DMML). It can be used to achieve the fusion of multi-modal features. We apply DMML to the field of multimedia retrieval and propose an innovative Deep Mamba Multi-modal Hashing (DMMH) method. It combines the advantages of algorithm accuracy and inference speed. We validated the effectiveness of DMMH on three public datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>SonicSense: Object Perception from In-Hand Acoustic Vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SonicSense, a holistic design of hardware and software to enable rich robot object perception through in-hand acoustic vibration sensing. While previous studies have shown promising results with acoustic sensing for object perception, current solutions are constrained to a handful of objects with simple geometries and homogeneous materials, single-finger sensing, and mixing training and testing on the same objects. SonicSense enables container inventory status differentiation, heterogeneous material prediction, 3D shape reconstruction, and object re-identification from a diverse set of 83 real-world objects. Our system employs a simple but effective heuristic exploration policy to interact with the objects as well as end-to-end learning-based algorithms to fuse vibration signals to infer object properties. Our framework underscores the significance of in-hand acoustic vibration sensing in advancing robot tactile perception.</description>

      <title>A Study on Synthesizing Expressive Violin Performances: Approaches and Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive music synthesis (EMS) for violin performance is a challenging task due to the disagreement among music performers in the interpretation of expressive musical terms (EMTs), scarcity of labeled recordings, and limited generalization ability of the synthesis model. These challenges create trade-offs between model effectiveness, diversity of generated results, and controllability of the synthesis system, making it essential to conduct a comparative study on EMS model design. This paper explores two violin EMS approaches. The end-to-end approach is a modification of a state-of-the-art text-to-speech generator. The parameter-controlled approach is based on a simple parameter sampling process that can render note lengths and other parameters compatible with MIDI-DDSP. We study these two approaches (in total, three model variants) through objective and subjective experiments and discuss several key issues of EMS based on the results.</description>

      <title>Improving the Consistency in Cross-Lingual Cross-Modal Retrieval with 1-to-K Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual Cross-modal Retrieval (CCR) is an essential task in web search, which aims to break the barriers between modality and language simultaneously and achieves image-text retrieval in the multi-lingual scenario with a single model. In recent years, excellent progress has been made based on cross-lingual cross-modal pre-training; particularly, the methods based on contrastive learning on large-scale data have significantly improved retrieval tasks. However, these methods directly follow the existing pre-training methods in the cross-lingual or cross-modal domain, leading to two problems of inconsistency in CCR: The methods with cross-lingual style suffer from the intra-modal error propagation, resulting in inconsistent recall performance across languages in the whole dataset. The methods with cross-modal style suffer from the inter-modal optimization direction bias, resulting in inconsistent rank across languages within each instance, which cannot be reflected by Recall@K. To solve these problems, we propose a simple but effective 1-to-K contrastive learning method, which treats each language equally and eliminates error propagation and optimization bias. In addition, we propose a new evaluation metric, Mean Rank Variance (MRV), to reflect the rank inconsistency across languages within each instance. Extensive experiments on four CCR datasets show that our method improves both recall rates and MRV with smaller-scale pre-trained data, achieving the new state-of-art.</description>

      <title>ObjFormer: Learning Land-Cover Changes From Paired OSM Data and Optical High-Resolution Imagery via Object-Guided Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical high-resolution imagery and OSM data are two important data sources of change detection (CD). Previous related studies focus on utilizing the information in OSM data to aid the CD on optical high-resolution images. This paper pioneers the direct detection of land-cover changes utilizing paired OSM data and optical imagery, thereby expanding the scope of CD tasks. To this end, we propose an object-guided Transformer (ObjFormer) by naturally combining the object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique with the advanced vision Transformer architecture. This combination can significantly reduce the computational overhead in the self-attention module without adding extra parameters or layers. ObjFormer has a hierarchical pseudo-siamese encoder consisting of object-guided self-attention modules that extracts multi-level heterogeneous features from OSM data and optical images; a decoder consisting of object-guided cross-attention modules can recover land-cover changes from the extracted heterogeneous features. Beyond basic binary change detection, this paper raises a new semi-supervised semantic change detection task that does not require any manually annotated land-cover labels to train semantic change detectors. Two lightweight semantic decoders are added to ObjFormer to accomplish this task efficiently. A converse cross-entropy loss is designed to fully utilize negative samples, contributing to the great performance improvement in this task. A large-scale benchmark dataset called OpenMapCD containing 1,287 samples covering 40 regions on six continents is constructed to conduct detailed experiments. The results show the effectiveness of our methods in this new kind of CD task. Additionally, case studies in Japanese cities demonstrate the framework's generalizability and practical potential. The OpenMapCD and source code are available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/ObjFormer</description>
