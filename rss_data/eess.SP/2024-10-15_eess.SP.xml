      <title>Crowd Size Estimation for Non-Uniform Spatial Distributions with mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing with RF signals such as mmWave radar has gained considerable interest in recent years. This is particularly relevant to 6G networks, which aim to integrate sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities for enhanced functionality. The contextual information provided by such sensing, whether collected by standalone non-ISAC units or integrated within ISAC, can not only optimize cellular network assets but can also serve as a valuable tool for a wide range of applications beyond network optimization. In this context, we present a novel methodology for crowd size estimation using monostatic mmWave radar, which is capable of accurately counting large crowds that are unevenly distributed across space. Our estimation approach relies on the rigorous derivation of occlusion probabilities, which are then used to mathematically characterize the probability distributions that describe the number of agents visible to the radar as a function of the crowd size. We then estimate the true crowd size by comparing these derived mathematical models to the empirical distribution of the number of visible agents detected by the radar. This method requires minimal sensing capabilities (e.g., angle-of-arrival information is not needed), thus being well suited for either a dedicated mmWave radar or an ISAC system. Extensive numerical simulations validate our methodology, demonstrating strong performance across diverse spatial distributions and for crowd sizes of up to (and including) 30 agents. We achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.48 agents, significantly outperforming a baseline which assumes that the agents are uniformly distributed in the area. Overall, our approach holds significant promise for a variety of applications including network resource allocation, crowd management, and urban planning.</description>

      <title>Fast Data-independent KLT Approximations Based on Integer Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT) stands as a well-established discrete transform, demonstrating optimal characteristics in data decorrelation and dimensionality reduction. Its ability to condense energy compression into a select few main components has rendered it instrumental in various applications within image compression frameworks. However, computing the KLT depends on the covariance matrix of the input data, which makes it difficult to develop fast algorithms for its implementation. Approximations for the KLT, utilizing specific rounding functions, have been introduced to reduce its computational complexity. Therefore, our paper introduces a category of low-complexity, data-independent KLT approximations, employing a range of round-off functions. The design methodology of the approximate transform is defined for any block-length $N$, but emphasis is given to transforms of $N = 8$ due to its wide use in image and video compression. The proposed transforms perform well when compared to the exact KLT and approximations considering classical performance measures. For particular scenarios, our proposed transforms demonstrated superior performance when compared to KLT approximations documented in the literature. We also developed fast algorithms for the proposed transforms, further reducing the arithmetic cost associated with their implementation. Evaluation of field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware implementation metrics was conducted. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the proposed transforms. In fact, we showed that one of the proposed transforms outperformed the exact KLT given certain compression ratios.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Moving Arrays for Near-Field Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter exploits moving arrays to enable nearfield multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sensing via a limited number of antenna elements. We consider a scenario where a base station (BS) is equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) on a moving platform. The objective is to locate a point target in the two-dimensional (2D) space by leveraging the near-field channel characteristics created by the movement of antenna arrays. Under this setup, we analyze the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's 2D coordinate, which provides the fundamental sensing performance limits for localization. It is revealed that our proposed design with a moving array achieves a CRB that is proportional to the CRB obtained by an equivalent extremely large ULA matching the platform's size. This shows that the movement of antenna array significantly enlarges its effective aperture to enable near-field sensing. Numerical results show that the proposed moving array design substantially enhances the target estimation performance compared to the conventional fixed array benchmark.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multiuser Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to employ movable antenna (MA) to enhance covert communications with noise uncertainty, where the confidential data is transmitted from an MA-aided access point (AP) to multiple users with a warden attempting to detect the existence of the legal transmission. To maximize the sum rate of users under covertness constraint, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the transmit beamforming and the positions of MAs at the AP. To solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we develop a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) based algorithm, where the proximal distance algorithm (PDA) and the successive convex approximation (SCA) are employed to optimize the transmit beamforming and the MAs' positions, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed MAs-aided system can significantly increase the covert sum rate via antenna position optimization as compared to conventional systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs).</description>

      <title>An Optical Method for Evaluating the Mechanical Properties of Wires Under Impact Tensile Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic properties of materials utilized in architecture or engineering applications can significantly affect their performance under dynamic or impact loading conditions. To evaluate such behavior, force transducers are commonly employed in testing. However, the calibration of force transducers is typically limited to static conditions and relies solely on gravitational forces exerted on standard masses. Thus, assessing the uncertainty in force measurements using force transducers during dynamic loading conditions remains a challenging task, presenting a significant obstacle in accurately characterizing the dynamic behavior of materials. In this work, an optical technique to evaluate the mechanical properties of wires subjected to impact tensile loads is presented. The wire under test is subjected to an impact tensile load by applying the inertial force of a rigid mass, which is supported by utilizing an aerostatic linear bearing with sufficiently small friction. The inertial force applied to the wire can be determined by multiplying the mass of the rigid mass by its acceleration, where the acceleration can be measured employing a Michelson type optical interferometer. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of a tungsten wire under impact tensile loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Cooperative ISAC Beamforming in Cell-Free MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the usage scenarios for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. In this paper, we study cooperative ISAC in cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where multiple MIMO access points (APs) collaboratively provide communication services and perform multi-static sensing. We formulate an optimization problem for the ISAC beamforming design, which maximizes the achievable sum-rate while guaranteeing the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement and total power constraint. Learning-based techniques are regarded as a promising approach for addressing such a nonconvex optimization problem. By taking the topology of cell-free MIMO systems into consideration, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), namely SACGNN, for ISAC beamforming design. The proposed SACGNN framework models the cell-free MIMO system for cooperative ISAC as a heterogeneous graph and employs a transformer-based heterogeneous message passing scheme to capture the important information of sensing and communication channels and propagate the information through the graph network. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed SACGNN framework over a conventional null-space projection based scheme and a deep neural network (DNN)-based baseline scheme.</description>

      <title>Source Localization of an Unknown Transmission in Dense Multipath Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the position of a wireless emitter in a multipath environment based on samples received at various base stations (in known locations) has been extensively explored in the literature. Existing approaches often assume that the emitted signal is known to the location system, while in some applications, such as locating surveillance or intelligence systems, it usually remains unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for determining the position of an emitter transmitting an unknown signal in a dense multipath environment with a given power-delay profile. We also derive the Carmer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to evaluate the estimator's performance. Our approach is based on approximating the dense multipath channel in the frequency domain as a Gaussian random vector using the central limit theorem, formulating a log-likelihood cost function for the position and some features of the transmitted signal, and applying a maximum search over both. The optimization problem is non-convex and has no known analytical solutions, which makes it computationally infeasible for multidimensional brute-force search. To address this challenge, we developed a practical optimization algorithm that overcomes the computational complexity, using reasonable approximations, that provides a feasible position estimator. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms other state-of-the-art estimators. Moreover, as the number of base stations and SNR increase, our estimator approaches the CRLB, indicating its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fingerprint-Spectrum-Based Synchronization in Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous radio transceivers often lead to significant range and velocity ambiguity, posing challenges for precise positioning and velocity estimation in passive-sensing perceptive mobile networks (PMNs). To address this issue, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO) synchronization algorithms have been studied in the literature. However, their performance can be significantly affected by the specific choice of the utilized window functions. Hence, we set out to find superior window functions capable of improving the performance of CFO and TO estimation algorithms. We first derive a near-optimal window, and the theoretical synchronization mean square error (MSE) when utilizing this window. However, since this window is not practically achievable, we then develop a practical window selection criterion and test a special window generated by the super-resolution algorithm. Numerical simulation has verified our analysis.</description>

      <title>Caching Content Placement and Beamforming Co-design for IRS-Aided MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When offloading links encounter deep fading and obstruction, edge caching cannot fully enhance wireless network performance and improve the QoS of edge nodes, as it fails to effectively reduce backhaul burden. The emerging technology of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) compensates for this disadvantage by creating a smart and reconfigurable wireless environment. Subsequently, we jointly design content placement and active/passive beamforming to minimize network costs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) in the IRS-oriented edge caching system. This minimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The content placement subproblem is addressed by applying KKT optimality conditions. We then develop the alternating optimization method to resolve precoder and reflection beamforming. Specifically, we reduce transmission power by first fixing the phase shift, reducing the problem to a convex one relative to the precoder, which is solved through convex optimization. Next, we fix the precoder and resolve the resulting reflection beamforming problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) method. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms uniform caching and random phase approaches in reducing transmission power and saving network costs. Eventually, the proposed approach offers potential improvements in the caching optimization and transmission robustness of wireless communication with imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>FSOS-AMC: Few-Shot Open-Set Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is essential for the advancement and efficiency of future wireless communication networks. Deep learning (DL)-based AMC frameworks have garnered extensive attention for their impressive classification performance. However, existing DL-based AMC frameworks rely on two assumptions, large-scale training data and the same class pool between the training and testing data, which are not suitable for \emph{few-shot and open-set} scenarios. To address this issue, a novel few-shot open-set automatic modulation classification (FSOS-AMC) framework is proposed by exploiting a multi-scale attention network, meta-prototype training, and a modular open-set classifier. The multi-scale attention network is used to extract the features from the input signal, the meta-prototype training is adopted to train the feature extractor and the modular open-set classifier can be utilized to classify the testing data into one of the known modulations or potential unknown modulations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FSOS-AMC framework can achieve higher classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods for known modulations and unknown modulations in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Moreover, the performance of the proposed FSOS-AMC framework under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions is much better than the compared schemes.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of OTFS-NOMA System with Fractional Doppler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of fractional Doppler on the performance of a system using orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) where users have different mobility profiles. Fractional Doppler results in inter-Doppler interference (IDI) and degrades the quality of OTFS-modulated signals. We consider a downlink (DL) communication scenario where multiple users are distinguished based on their mobility profiles into a single high-mobility (HM) user and multiple low-mobility (LM) users. OTFS modulation is implemented for the HM user by embedding its information symbols in the delay-Doppler domain, while LM users' symbols are represented in the time-frequency (TF) domain. The LM users' signals are kept orthogonal to each other in the frequency domain by accessing disjoint subcarriers. Further, NOMA spectrum sharing is implemented between the HM user and the KM users to achieve higher spectral efficiency. Performance analysis in terms of DL spectral efficiency and outage probability is conducted for different system parameters. The numerical results show that IDI has a noticeable performance impact on the HM user, depending on the NOMA parameters.</description>

      <title>WAND: Wavelet Analysis-based Neural Decomposition of MRS Signals for Artifact Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of metabolites in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is challenged by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), overlapping metabolites, and various artifacts. Particularly, unknown and unparameterized baseline effects obscure the quantification of low-concentration metabolites, limiting MRS reliability. This paper introduces wavelet analysis-based neural decomposition (WAND), a novel data-driven method designed to decompose MRS signals into their constituent components: metabolite-specific signals, baseline, and artifacts. WAND takes advantage of the enhanced separability of these components within the wavelet domain. The method employs a neural network, specifically a U-Net architecture, trained to predict masks for wavelet coefficients obtained through the continuous wavelet transform. These masks effectively isolate desired signal components in the wavelet domain, which are then inverse-transformed to obtain separated signals. Notably, an artifact mask is created by inverting the sum of all known signal masks, enabling WAND to capture and remove even unpredictable artifacts. The effectiveness of WAND in achieving accurate decomposition is demonstrated through numerical evaluations using simulated spectra. Furthermore, WAND's artifact removal capabilities significantly enhance the quantification accuracy of linear combination model fitting. The method's robustness is further validated using data from the 2016 MRS Fitting Challenge and in-vivo experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a cognitive radar system capable of adapting its parameters is challenging, particularly when tasked with tracking a ballistic missile throughout its entire flight. In this work, we focus on proposing adaptive algorithms that select waveform parameters in an online fashion. Our novelty lies in formulating the learning problem using domain knowledge derived from the characteristics of ballistic trajectories. We propose three reinforcement learning algorithms: bandwidth scaling, Q-learning, and Q-learning lookahead. These algorithms dynamically choose the bandwidth for each transmission based on received feedback. Through experiments on synthetically generated ballistic trajectories, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve the dual objectives of minimizing range error and maintaining continuous tracking without losing the target.</description>

      <title>LISAC: Learned Coded Waveform Design for ISAC with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep learning based method to design a coded waveform for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Our ultimate goal is to design a coded waveform, which is capable of providing satisfactory sensing performance of the target while maintaining high communication quality measured in terms of the bit error rate (BER). The proposed LISAC provides an improved waveform design with the assistance of deep neural networks for the encoding and decoding of the information bits. In particular, the transmitter, parameterized by a recurrent neural network (RNN), encodes the input bit sequence into the transmitted waveform for both sensing and communications. The receiver employs a RNN-based decoder to decode the information bits while the transmitter senses the target via maximum likelihood detection. We optimize the system considering both the communication and sensing performance. Simulation results show that the proposed LISAC waveform achieves a better trade-off curve compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Synchronization for Multiuser Uplink OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for the uplink of multiuser OTFS (MU-OTFS) in high-mobility scenarios. We introduce a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern where each user utilizes a pilot with a cyclic prefix (PCP) within a shared pilot region on the delay-Doppler plane. At the receiver, a bank of filters is deployed to separate the users' signals and accurately estimate their timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Our technique employs a threshold-based approach that provides precise TO estimates. Our proposed CFO estimation technique reduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into multiple one-dimensional search problems. Furthermore, we apply the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to effectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO estimates for all the users. Finally, we numerically investigate the error performance of our proposed synchronization technique in high mobility scenarios for the MU-OTFS uplink. Our simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed technique in estimating the TOs and CFOs which also leads to an improved channel estimation performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancements in graph neural network, there has been increasing interest in applying this network to ECG signal analysis. In this study, we generated an adjacency matrix using correlation matrix of extracted features and applied a graph neural network to classify arrhythmias.

      <title>Ellora: Exploring Low-Power OFDM-based Radar Processors using Approximate Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based radar has gained wide acceptance given its applicability in joint radar-communication systems. However, realizing such a system on hardware poses a huge area and power bottleneck given its complexity. Therefore it has become ever-important to explore low-power OFDM-based radar processors in order to realize energy-efficient joint radar-communication systems targeting edge devices. This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenges by exploiting approximations on hardware for early design space exploration (DSE) of trade-offs between accuracy, area and power. We present Ellora, a DSE framework for incorporating approximations in an OFDM radar processing pipeline. Ellora uses pairs of approximate adders and multipliers to explore design points realizing energy-efficient radar processors. Particularly, we incorporate approximations into the block involving periodogram based estimation and report area, power and accuracy levels. Experimental results show that at an average accuracy loss of 0.063% in the positive SNR region, we save 22.9% of on-chip area and 26.2% of power. Towards achieving the area and power statistics, we design a fully parallel Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) core which acts as a part of periodogram based estimation and approximate the addition and multiplication operations in it. The aforementioned results show that Ellora can be used in an integrated way with various other optimization methods for generating low-power and energy-efficient radar processors.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Hybrid Precoding in Millimeter Wave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid analog/digital architecture that connects a limited number of RF chains to multiple antennas through phase shifters could effectively address the energy consumption issues in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the main challenges in hybrid precoding lie in the coupling between analog and digital precoders and the constant modulus constraint. Generally, traditional optimization algorithms for this problem typically suffer from high computational complexity or suboptimal performance, while deep learning based solutions exhibit poor scalability and robustness. This paper proposes a plug and play, free of pre-training solution that leverages gradient guided meta learning (GGML) framework to maximize the spectral efficiency of MIMO systems through hybrid precoding. Specifically, GGML utilizes gradient information as network input to facilitate the sharing of gradient information flow. We retain the iterative process of traditional algorithms and leverage meta learning to alternately optimize the precoder. Simulation results show that this method outperforms existing methods, demonstrates robustness to variations in system parameters, and can even exceed the performance of fully digital weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding with the same number of antennas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated novel approach to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based wheelchair development, utilizing a voluntary Right Left Hand Movement mechanism for control. The system is designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on voluntary right and left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements. The data was acquired at a sampling frequency 200Hz in the laboratory experiment. The system integrates a Tkinter-based interface for simulating wheelchair movements, offering users a functional and intuitive control system. Various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, random forest, and a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) attention-based model, were developed. The random forest model obtained 79% accuracy. Great performance was seen on the Logistic Regression model which outperforms other models with 92% accuracy and 91% accuracy on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The Bi-LSTM attention-based model achieved a mean accuracy of 86% through cross-validation, showcasing the potential of attention mechanisms in BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Generative Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Data Augmentation of Cardiac Auscultation Signals: Improving Model Robustness Using Synthetic Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately interpreting cardiac auscultation signals plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. However, the paucity of labelled data inhibits classification models' training. Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques combined with signal processing to augment the existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models to overcome this challenge. However, the primary focus of prior studies has been on model performance as opposed to model robustness. Robustness, in this case, is defined as both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. This work shows that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmentations consist of traditional audio approaches and the creation of synthetic audio conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models. It is found that both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance can be improved over various datasets when training a convolutional neural network-based classification model with this augmented dataset. With the performance increase encompassing not only accuracy but also balanced accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient, an augmented dataset significantly contributes to resolving issues of imbalanced datasets. This, in turn, helps provide a more general and robust classifier.</description>

      <title>X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Performance, Current and Future Usage of Vehicle-To-Everything Communication Standards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication between road users is essential for environmental perception, reasoning, and mission planning to enable fully autonomous vehicles, and thus improve road safety and transport efficiency. To enable collaborative driving, the concept of vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) has long been introduced to the industry. Within the last two decades, several communication standards have been developed based on IEEE 802.11p and cellular standards, namely Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC), Intelligent Transportation System G5 (ITS-G5), and Cellular- and New Radio- Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X and NR-V2X). However, while there exists a high quantity of available publications concerning V2X and the analysis of the different standards, only few surveys exist that summarize these results. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no survey that provides an analysis about possible future trends and challenges for the global implementation of V2Xexists. Thus, this contribution provides a detailed survey on Vehicle-to-Everything communication standards, their performance, current and future applications, and associated challenges. Based on our research, we have identified several research gaps and provide a picture about the possible future of the Vehicle-to-Everything communication domain.</description>

      <title>Near-Pilotless MIMO Single Carrier Communications using Matrix Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) is a key enabler of higher data rates in the next generation wireless communications. However in MIMO systems, channel estimation and equalization are challenging particularly in the presence of rapidly changing channels. The high pilot overhead required for channel estimation can reduce the system throughput for large antenna configuration. In this paper, we provide an iterative matrix decomposition algorithm for near-pilotless or blind decoding of MIMO signals, in a single carrier system with frequency domain equalization. This novel approach replaces the standard equalization and estimates both the transmitted data and the channel without the knowledge of any prior distributions, by making use of only one pilot. Our simulations demonstrate improved performance, in terms of error rates, compared to the more widely used pilot-based Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) method.</description>

      <title>Separation of Neural Drives to Muscles from Transferred Polyfunctional Nerves using Implanted Micro-electrode Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following limb amputation, neural signals for limb functions persist in the residual peripheral nerves. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) allows to redirected these signals into spare muscles to recover the neural information through electromyography (EMG). However, a significant challenge arises in separating distinct neural commands redirected from the transferred nerves to the muscles. Disentangling overlapping signals from EMG recordings remains complex, as they can contain mixed neural information that complicates limb function interpretation. To address this challenge, Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNIs) surgically partition the nerve into individual fascicles that reinnervate specific muscle grafts, isolating distinct neural sources for more precise control and interpretation of EMG signals. We introduce a novel biointerface that combines TMR surgery of polyvalent nerves with a high-density micro-electrode array implanted at a single site within a reinnervated muscle. Instead of surgically identifying distinct nerve fascicles, our approach separates all neural signals that are re-directed into a single muscle, using the high spatio-temporal selectivity of the micro-electrode array and mathematical source separation methods. We recorded EMG signals from four reinnervated muscles while volunteers performed phantom limb tasks. The decomposition of these signals into motor unit activity revealed distinct clusters of motor neurons associated with diverse functional tasks. Notably, our method enabled the extraction of multiple neural commands within a single reinnervated muscle, eliminating the need for surgical nerve division. This approach not only has the potential of enhancing prosthesis control but also uncovers mechanisms of motor neuron synergies following TMR, providing valuable insights into how the central nervous system encodes movement after reinnervation.</description>

      <title>SensorBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Coding-Based Sensor Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective processing, interpretation, and management of sensor data have emerged as a critical component of cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, processing sensor data requires profound theoretical knowledge and proficiency in signal-processing tools. However, recent works show that Large Language Models (LLMs) have promising capabilities in processing sensory data, suggesting their potential as copilots for developing sensing systems.
  To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.</description>

      <title>Continuous emission ultrasound: a new paradigm to ultrafast ultrasound imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current imaging techniques in echography rely on the pulse-echo (PE) paradigm which provides a straight-forward access to the in-depth structure of tissues. They inherently face two major challenges: the limitation of the pulse repetition frequency, directly linked to the imaging framerate, and, due to the emission scheme, their blindness to the phenomena that happen in the medium during the majority of the acquisition time. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new paradigm for ultrasound imaging, denoted by continuous emission ultrasound imaging (CUEI) \cite{CEUIpatent2023}, for a single input single output (SISO) device.
  A continuous insonification of the medium is done by the probe using a coded waveform inspired from the radar and sonar literature. A framework coupling a sliding window approach (SWA) and pulse compression methods processes the recorded echoes to rebuild a motion-mode (M-mode) image from the medium with a high temporal resolution compared to state-of-the-art ultrafast imaging methods.
  A study on realistic simulated data, with regards to the motion of the medium, has been carried out and, achieved results assess an unequivocal improvement of the slow time frequency up to, at least, two orders of magnitude compared to ultrafast US imaging methods. This enhancement leads, therefore, to a ten times improvement in the temporal separability of the imaging system. In addition, it demonstrates the capability of CEUI to catch relatively short and quick events, in comparison to the imaging period of PE methods, at any instant of the acquisition.</description>

      <title>Decision Transformers for Wireless Communications: A New Paradigm of Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the next generation of mobile systems evolves, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to deeply integrate with wireless communications for resource management in variable environments. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an important tool for addressing stochastic optimization issues of resource allocation. However, DRL has to start each new training process from the beginning once the state and action spaces change, causing low sample efficiency and poor generalization ability. Moreover, each DRL training process may take a large number of epochs to converge, which is unacceptable for time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we adopt an alternative AI technology, namely, Decision Transformer (DT), and propose a DT-based adaptive decision architecture for wireless resource management. This architecture innovates through constructing pre-trained models in the cloud and then fine-tuning personalized models at the edges. By leveraging the power of DT models learned over offline datasets, the proposed architecture is expected to achieve rapid convergence with many fewer training epochs and higher performance in new scenarios with different state and action spaces, compared with DRL. We then design DT frameworks for two typical communication scenarios: intelligent reflecting surfaces-aided communications and unmanned aerial vehicle-aided mobile edge computing. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed DT frameworks achieve over $3$-$6$ times speedup in convergence and better performance relative to the classic DRL method, namely, proximal policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based IRS Assisted NLoS DoA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel learning-based methodology for Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation in environments featuring an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) or Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), particularly under challenging Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. The core innovation lies in the integration of a specialized Neural Network (NN) layer, termed the NN-based RIS layer, within a broader network architecture.
  The NN-based RIS layer is meticulously designed to autonomously learn the optimal phase shifts for the RIS, specifically tailored to enhance the accuracy of DoA estimation. In this framework, pre-processed real-valued input observations are directed into the RIS layer, which possesses a distinct and specialized structure. Unlike conventional neural network layers, the NN-based RIS layer imposes constraints on its weights, requiring them to be sinusoidal functions. The phase arguments of these sinusoidal functions serve as the tunable parameters during the training process, effectively enabling the layer to simulate the physical behavior of an RIS.
  To accommodate the unique properties of the NN-based RIS layer, the standard feed-forward and back-propagation algorithms are adapted, ensuring that the learning process aligns with the specialized requirements of the RIS-based architecture. This innovative approach allows the network to seamlessly integrate the RIS functionality into the DoA estimation process.
  Extensive numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning-based technique, demonstrating its superior performance compared to traditional non-learning-based methods across a range of RIS-assisted scenarios. The results underscore the potential of this approach to significantly enhance DoA estimation accuracy in complex wireless communication environments, paving the way for future advancements in RIS-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Wavelet Transformations for Deep Learning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) strategies have recently been utilized to diagnose motor faults by simply analyzing motor phase current signals, offering a less costly and non-intrusive alternative to vibration sensors. This research transforms these time-series current signals into time-frequency 2D representations via Wavelet Transform (WT). The dataset for motor current signals includes 3,750 data points across five categories: one representing normal conditions and four representing artificially induced faults, each under five different load conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The study employs five WT-based techniques: WT-Amor, WT-Bump, WT-Morse, WSST-Amor, and WSST-Bump. Subsequently, five DL models adopting prior Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture were developed and tested using the transformed 2D plots from each method. The DL models for WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and WT-Morse showed remarkable effectiveness with peak model accuracy of 90.93, 89.20, and 93.73%, respectively, surpassing previous 2D-image-based methods that recorded accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80% respectively using the identical dataset and validation protocol. Notably, the WT-Morse approach slightly exceeded the formerly highest ML technique, achieving a 93.20% accuracy. However, the two WSST methods that utilized synchrosqueezing techniques faced difficulty accurately classifying motor faults. The performance of Wavelet-based deep learning methods offers a compelling alternative for machine condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis using Short-time Fourier Transformation Variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In motor condition diagnosis, electrical current signature serves as an alternative feature to vibration-based sensor data, which is a more expensive and invasive method. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</description>

      <title>Channel Correlation Matrix Extrapolation Based on Roughness Calibration of Scatterers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To estimate the channel correlation matrix (CCM) in areas where channel information cannot be collected in advance, this paper proposes a way to spatially extrapolate CCM based on the calibration of the surface roughness parameters of scatterers in the propagation scene. We calibrate the roughness parameters of scene scatters based on CCM data in some specific areas. From these calibrated roughness parameters, we are able to generate a good prediction of the CCM for any other area in the scene by performing ray tracing. Simulation results show that the channel extrapolation method proposed in this paper can effectively realize the extrapolation of the CCM between different areas in frequency domain, or even from one domain to another.</description>

      <title>NirvaWave: An Accurate and Efficient Near Field Wave Propagation Simulator for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended near-field range in future mm-Wave and sub-THz wireless networks demands a precise and efficient near-field channel simulator for understanding and optimizing wireless communications in this less-explored regime. This paper presents NirvaWave, a novel near-field channel simulator, built on scalar diffraction theory and Fourier principles, to provide precise wave propagation response in complex wireless mediums under custom user-defined transmitted EM signals. NirvaWave offers an interface for investigating novel near-field wavefronts, e.g., Airy beams, Bessel beams, and the interaction of mmWave and sub-THz signals with obstructions, reflectors, and scatterers. The simulation run-time in NirvaWave is orders of magnitude lower than its EM software counterparts that directly solve Maxwell Equations. Hence, NirvaWave enables a user-friendly interface for large-scale channel simulations required for developing new model-driven and data-driven techniques. We evaluated the performance of NirvaWave through direct comparison with EM simulation software. Finally, we have open-sourced the core codebase of NirvaWave in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/vahidyazdnian1378/NirvaWave).</description>

      <title>Anti-jamming Transmission of Downlink Cell Free Millimeter-Wave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, the maximization of resistible jamming power is studied for multi-user downlink millimeter-wave cell-free multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-MIMO) systems. We propose an alternate optimization-based anti-jamming hybrid beamforming (AO-AJHBF) scheme. For receiving beamforming, more practical prior about the jamming channel, i.e., second-order statistics rather than instantaneous information, is exploited via maximizing the generalized Rayleigh quotient. For transmitting beamforming, we use the max-min fairness principle and propose a low-complexity projected gradient ascent-based method to circumvent the excessive computation of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Simulations verify the performance advantage of proposed AO-AJHBF over schemes based on weighted minimum mean square error and SDR methods.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy with Higher Utility by Exploiting Coordinate-wise Disparity: Laplace Mechanism Can Beat Gaussian in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventionally, in a differentially private additive noise mechanism, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise samples are added to each coordinate of the response. In this work, we formally present the addition of noise that is independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) across the coordinates to achieve tighter privacy-accuracy trade-off by exploiting coordinate-wise disparity in privacy leakage. In particular, we study the i.n.i.d. Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms and obtain the conditions under which these mechanisms guarantee privacy. The optimal choice of parameters that ensure these conditions are derived theoretically. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations demonstrate that the i.n.i.d. mechanisms achieve higher utility for the given privacy requirements compared to their i.i.d. counterparts. One of the interesting observations is that the Laplace mechanism outperforms Gaussian even in high dimensions, as opposed to the popular belief, if the irregularity in coordinate-wise sensitivities is exploited. We also demonstrate how the i.n.i.d. noise can improve the performance in private (a) coordinate descent, (b) principal component analysis, and (c) deep learning with group clipping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based object detectors have shown remarkable accuracy for automated brain tumor detection. In this paper, we develop a novel BGF-YOLO architecture by incorporating Bi-level routing attention, Generalized feature pyramid networks, and Fourth detecting head into YOLOv8. BGF-YOLO contains an attention mechanism to focus more on important features, and feature pyramid networks to enrich feature representation by merging high-level semantic features with spatial details. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of different attention mechanisms and feature fusions, detection head architectures on brain tumor detection accuracy. Experimental results show that BGF-YOLO gives a 4.7% absolute increase of mAP$_{50}$ compared to YOLOv8x, and achieves state-of-the-art on the brain tumor detection dataset Br35H. The code is available at https://github.com/mkang315/BGF-YOLO.</description>

      <title>The Local Landscape of Phase Retrieval Under Limited Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fine-grained analysis of the local landscape of phase retrieval under the regime of limited samples. Specifically, we aim to ascertain the minimal sample size required to guarantee a benign local landscape surrounding global minima in high dimensions. Let $n$ and $d$ denote the sample size and input dimension, respectively. We first explore the local convexity and establish that when $n=o(d\log d)$, for almost every fixed point in the local ball, the Hessian matrix has negative eigenvalues, provided $d$ is sufficiently large. % Consequently, the local landscape is highly non-convex. We next consider the one-point convexity and show that, as long as $n=\omega(d)$, with high probability, the landscape is one-point strongly convex in the local annulus: $\{w\in\mathbb{R}^d: o_d(1)\leqslant \|w-w^*\|\leqslant c\}$, where $w^*$ is the ground truth and $c$ is an absolute constant. This implies that gradient descent, initialized from any point in this domain, can converge to an $o_d(1)$-loss solution exponentially fast. Furthermore, we show that when $n=o(d\log d)$, there is a radius of $\widetilde\Theta\left(\sqrt{1/d}\right)$ such that one-point convexity breaks down in the corresponding smaller local ball. This indicates an impossibility of establishing a convergence to the exact $w^*$ for gradient descent under limited samples by relying solely on one-point convexity.</description>

      <title>Temporal Action Localization for Inertial-based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As of today, state-of-the-art activity recognition from wearable sensors relies on algorithms being trained to classify fixed windows of data. In contrast, video-based Human Activity Recognition, known as Temporal Action Localization (TAL), has followed a segment-based prediction approach, localizing activity segments in a timeline of arbitrary length. This paper is the first to systematically demonstrate the applicability of state-of-the-art TAL models for both offline and near-online Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using raw inertial data as well as pre-extracted latent features as input. Offline prediction results show that TAL models are able to outperform popular inertial models on a multitude of HAR benchmark datasets, with improvements reaching as much as 26% in F1-score. We show that by analyzing timelines as a whole, TAL models can produce more coherent segments and achieve higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets. We demonstrate that TAL is less suited for the immediate classification of small-sized windows of data, yet offers an interesting perspective on inertial-based HAR -- alleviating the need for fixed-size windows and enabling algorithms to recognize activities of arbitrary length. With design choices and training concepts yet to be explored, we argue that TAL architectures could be of significant value to the inertial-based HAR community. The code and data download to reproduce experiments is publicly available via github.com/mariusbock/tal_for_har.</description>

      <title>A Novel RFID Authentication Protocol Based on A Block-Order-Modulus Variable Matrix Encryption Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, authentication for mobile radio frequency identification (RFID) systems with low-cost RFID sensor tags is studied. Firstly, an adaptive modulus (AM) encryption algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, in order to enhance the security without additional storage of new key matrices, a self-updating encryption order (SUEO) algorithm is designed. Furthermore, a diagonal block local transpose key matrix (DBLTKM) encryption algorithm is presented, which effectively expands the feasible domain of the key space. Based on the above three algorithms, a novel joint AM-SUEO-DBLTKM encryption algorithm is constructed. Making full use of the advantages of the proposed joint algorithm, a two-way RFID authentication protocol, named AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID, is proposed for mobile RFID systems. In addition, the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and security analysis indicate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol can effectively combat various typical attacks. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM algorithm can save 99.59% of tag storage over traditional algorithms. Finally, the low computational complexity as well as the low storage cost of the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol facilitates deployment within low-cost RFID sensor tags.</description>

      <title>Unified Timing Analysis for Closed-Loop Goal-Oriented Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication has become one of the focal concepts in sixth-generation communication systems owing to its potential to provide intelligent, immersive, and real-time mobile services. The emerging paradigms of goal-oriented communication constitute closed loops integrating communication, computation, and sensing. However, challenges arise for closed-loop timing analysis due to multiple random factors that affect the communication/computation latency, as well as the heterogeneity of feedback mechanisms across multi-modal sensing data. To tackle these problems, we aim to provide a unified timing analysis framework for closed-loop goal-oriented communication (CGC) systems over fading channels. The proposed framework is unified as it considers computation, compression, and communication latency in the loop with different configurations. To capture the heterogeneity across multi-modal feedback, we categorize the sensory data into the periodic-feedback and event-triggered, respectively. We formulate timing constraints based on average and tail performance, covering timeliness, jitter, and reliability of CGC systems. A method based on saddlepoint approximation is proposed to obtain the distribution of closed-loop latency. The results show that the modified saddlepoint approximation is capable of accurately characterizing the latency distribution of the loop with analytically tractable expressions. This sets the basis for low-complexity co-design of communication and computation.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (ONMF) has become a standard approach for clustering. As far as we know, most works on ONMF rely on the Frobenius norm to assess the quality of the approximation. This paper presents a new model and algorithm for ONMF that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As opposed to the Frobenius norm which assumes Gaussian noise, the KL divergence is the maximum likelihood estimator for Poisson-distributed data, which can model better sparse vectors of word counts in document data sets and photo counting processes in imaging. We develop an algorithm based on alternating optimization, KL-ONMF, and show that it performs favorably with the Frobenius-norm based ONMF for document classification and hyperspectral image unmixing.</description>
