      <title>Autonomous Sampling and SHAP Interpretation of Deposition-Rates in Bipolar HiPIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.</description>

      <title>Directed Nano-antennas for Laser Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do we use nano-antennas for fusion? In three sentences: The present laser induced fusion plans use extreme mechanical shock compression to get one hotspot and then ignition. Still fusion burning spreads slower than expansion, and mechanical instabilities may also develop. With nano-antennas in radiation dominated systems, simultaneous ignition can be achieved in the whole target volume and there is no time left for mechanical instabilities. Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.
  Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target. This arises from a mistaken assumption, [1] that the detonation normal 4-vector should have vanishing time-like component, and this assumption eliminates the possibility to rapid or even simultaneous, radiation dominated detonations, (which are well known in the burning (or hadronization) of Quark Gluon Plasma).</description>

      <title>Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation in Laser Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation (BISER) appears as a bright temporally and spatially coherent Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray source driven by compact multi-terawatt femtosecond lasers in gas targets. There BISER originates from relativistic plasma singularities, so that the emission source size has a nanometer scale. The BISER x-ray yield quadratically depends on the driving laser power. BISER spectra have hundreds of electronvolt (eV) bandwidth embracing the 'water window' region (284 - 543 eV). Simulations predict that BISER pulses have durations close to the transform limit, which promises pulses shorter than the atomic unit of time (24 attoseconds). Based on the BISER brightness at ~20 terawatt laser power and the quadratic scaling, the brightness of BISER driven by petawatt-class lasers is predicted to exceed XUV free electron lasers. The BISER concept creates a new framework for a wide range of media emitting travelling waves capable of constructive interference, including gravitational waves. Here we review the BISER experimental discovery, its explanation based on the relativistic laser plasma simulations and catastrophe theory, experimental validation of the theoretical BISER model, proposal for imaging fast moving singularities, driving laser requirements, and future prospects emphasizing the driving laser wavelength scalability and possibility of terawatt attosecond coherent x-ray pulse generation.</description>

      <title>Similarity Theory and Scaling Networks for Electromagnetic Wave-Driven Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the scale-invariant behavior of electromagnetic wave-driven radio-frequency plasmas across different dimensional scales. Using two-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that plasma uniformity remains the same in similar discharges. Building on the concept of similarity laws, we develop scaling networks that effectively relate plasma parameters across varying operating conditions. These results establish a generalized similarity theory derived from the Boltzmann equation coupled with the full set of Maxwell equations, extending the theoretical framework of similarity laws into electromagnetic regimes.</description>

      <title>Conservative formulation of the drift-reduced fluid plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conservative formulation of the drift-reduced fluid plasma model is constructed by analytically inverting the implicit relation defining the polarisation velocity as a function of the time-derivative of the electric field. The obtained model satisfies exact conservation laws for energy, mass, charge and momentum, in arbitrary magnetic geometry, also when electromagnetic fluctuations are included.</description>

      <title>Kineclinic magnetogenesis in relativistic collisionless plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic momentum equation of a collisionless plasma is reformulated to describe the time evolution of canonical vorticity. Compared to the non-relativistic counterpart, an additional source term for canonical vorticity is identified, which embodies the misalignment between the fluid momentum and fluid velocity gradients. This kineclinic term breaks the frozen-in condition of canonical vorticity, thereby enabling generation or dissipation of magnetic fields and vorticity. We verify the role of this effect through particle-in-cell simulations of a modified Beltrami flow. Kineclinicity should be finite for all relativistic plasma systems due to the general lack of a functional relationship between fluid momentum and fluid velocity.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantitative Electric-Field Measurements of Inception Clouds in Nanosecond Discharges Using E-FISH Assisted by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatio-temporal evolution of the electric field during the early stages of a nanosecond positive corona discharge in atmospheric-pressure air by combining time-resolved E-FISH measurements, machine-learning-assisted field inversion (based on a recently developed operator-learning model), and iCCD optical emission imaging. The objective is to quantitatively characterize the electric field in the vicinity of the high-voltage electrode during inception and the transition toward streamer formation. By averaging over a large number of discharge events and operating in a regime where the discharge remains statistically axisymmetric, the proposed approach enables reconstruction of the electric-field profiles with nanosecond resolution. The results show a rapid increase of the field during the first nanoseconds, followed by the formation of a shell-like structure exhibiting the highest reduced fields prior to destabilization. The reconstructed reduced electric-field magnitude reaches peak values in the range of approximately 230-270 Td, with an estimated uncertainty of about 20-30% associated with calibration and profile-shape effects. These values correspond to the regime where electron-impact excitation and photoionization processes become highly efficient, consistent with the observed transition from a stable inception cloud to streamer destabilization. After the onset of streamer branching, increasing asymmetry limits the applicability of the inversion, and the reconstructed fields represent averaged contributions rather than the local field at individual streamer heads. The methodology thus identifies the conditions under which quantitative E-field mapping is reliable and establishes a framework for extending electric-field diagnostics to the inception phase of nanosecond atmospheric discharges.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of ion temperature gradient modes in burning plasma conditions in the presence of energetic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between energetic particles (EPs) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes is studied using the global particle in cell ORB5 code. In this work, we extend previous studies to a broader range of EP temperatures, including the burning plasma regime and to wider variety of EP distribution functions. Two main stabilization mechanisms are found to be effective in ITG stabilization confirming previous studies: direct dispersion relation modification (DDRM) effective only at intermediate EP temperatures and dilution effect (DE) which is independent of EP temperature and becomes dominant in burning plasma regime ($T_f &gt; 50T_i$). The study is further extended to slowing-down EP distributions which in contrast exhibit no DDRM-related stabilization. The findings are further validated in an ITER pre-fusion operation scenario and additionally compared with electromagnetic effects. In this scenario EP stabilization is found to be weaker than $\beta$-stabilization. Overall, these results provide better understanding of EP-ITG interactions over a wider range of EP parameters relevant to burning plasma regime which is important for predicting turbulence and confinement in future devices such as ITER.</description>

      <title>Comment on Nuclear Fusion 66, 016012 (2026) and arXiv:2508.03561 by Richard Fitzpatrick, A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article Nuclear Fusion \textbf{66}, 016012 (2026) by Richard Fitzpatrick is based on fundamental errors in the physics of the poloidal magnetic flux in tokamaks. His paper was inspired by an article that I posted on arXiv in various versions [arXiv:2507.05456]. The September 9, 2025 version was submitted to the Physics of Plasmas, which flatly rejected the article. Before I can resubmit, the Physics of Plasmas stated that the issues with the Fitzpatrick article must be explained. Not only did Fitzpatrick make numerous fundamental errors in science, he totally misrepresented my views as clearly stated in my article and even more explicitly in email exchanges, called ``private communication" in his paper. Enquiries were made to the journal Nuclear Fusion staring on November 24, 2025 of the consistency of Fitzpatrick's article with the scientific and ethical standards of the journal. On January 5, 2026, Nuclear Fusion said they had "no evidence of intentional misrepresentation," but others may disagree after reading the emails. Both grants and the publication of an important paper make the public availability of this Comment urgent.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational stratification of multi-fluid-multi-species plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Properties of MHD Waves in the Expanding Solar Wind for a Parker Spiral Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the effects of solar wind expansion on the dispersive properties of the three normal modes of ideal MHD using the Expanding Box Model, under a background magnetic field that follows the Parker spiral geometry. From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $\omega(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfv\'enic to compressive fluctuations between $\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of driven systems via the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the differences between the driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation and the second law of thermodynamics. A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.</description>

      <title>Energy Bounds from Relative Magnetic Helicity in Spherical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Self-organization of local streamline structures and energy transfer rate in compressible plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine how local streamline topology and energy cascade rate self-organize in plasma turbulence for both compressible and incompressible regimes. Using a fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we quantify the subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures by means of grandient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field. Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\nabla\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental investigation into the energy partitioning of quasi-static electrostatic discharge (ESD) events in air, a scenario in which the discharge occurs across a gap length that can be considered fixed. We systematically characterize the energy transferred to a series victim load across a broad range of resistances (0.1 to 10,000Ohm) and circuit parameters, including capacitance and gap length. Our results show that the fraction of stored energy delivered to the victim load is largely independent of gap length. We demonstrate that our extension of the classic Rompe-Weizel spark resistance model effectively predicts the scaling of this energy transfer, establishing a clear link between spark resistance and energy partitioning. These findings provide a predictive framework that should be valuable for guiding safety requirements for energetic materials and ignition scenarios and will inform the development of more accurate circuit models that can be applied to a wider range of ESD events such as those found in the electronics industry.</description>
