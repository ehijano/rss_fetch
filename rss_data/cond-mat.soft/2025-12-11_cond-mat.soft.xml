      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>

      <title>Modeling Complex Multiphysics Systems with Discrete Element Method Enriched with the Kernel-Independent Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes the coupling of the MercuryDPM discrete element method (DEM) code and the implementation of the kernel-independent fast multipole method (KIFMM). The combined simulation framework allows addressing the large class of multiscale problems, including both the mechanical interactions of particulates at the fine scale and the long-range interactions of various natures at the coarse scale. Among these are electrostatic interactions in powders, clays, and particulates, magnetic interactions in ferromagnetic granulates, and gravitational interactions in asteroid clouds. The formalism of rigid clumps is successfully combined with KIFMM, enabling addressing problems involving complex long-large interactions between non-spherical particles with arbitrary charge distributions. The capabilities of our technique are demonstrated in several application examples.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Logarithmic Barrier: Activity-Induced Recovery of Phase Separation Dynamics in Confined Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation in confined environments is a fundamental process underlying geological flows, porous filtration, emulsions, and intracellular organization. Yet, how confinement and activity jointly govern coarsening kinetics and interfacial morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of passive and active fluids embedded in complex porous media. By generating porous host structures via a freeze-quench protocol, we systematically control the average pore size and demonstrate that confinement induces a crossover from the Lifshitz-Slyozov power-law growth to logarithmically slowed coarsening, ultimately arresting domain evolution. Analysis of correlation functions and structure factors reveals that confined passive systems exhibit fractal interfaces, violating Porod's law and indicating rough morphological arrest. In contrast, introducing self-propulsion dramatically changes the coarsening pathway: activity restores smooth interfaces, breaks the confinement-induced scaling laws, and drives a transition from logarithmic to ballistic domain growth at high activity levels. Our findings reveal an activity-controlled mechanism to overcome geometric restrictions and unlock coarsening in structurally heterogeneous environments. These insights establish a unifying framework for nonequilibrium phase transitions in porous settings, with broad relevance to active colloids, catalytic media, and biologically crowded systems, where living matter routinely reorganizes within geometric constraints to sustain function.</description>

      <title>High-throughput characterization of snap-through stability boundaries of bistable beams in a programmable rotating platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a high-throughput platform that enables simultaneous, parallel testing of six bistable beams via programmable motion of a rotating disk. By prescribing harmonic angular dynamics, the platform explores the phase space of angular velocity and acceleration $(\Omega,\,\dot{\Omega})$, producing continuously varying centrifugal and Euler force fields that act as tunable body forces in our specimens. Image processing extracts beam kinematics with sub-pixel accuracy, enabling precise identification of snap-through events. By testing six beams in parallel, the platform allows systematic variation of beam thickness, pre-compression, tilt angle, and clamp orientations across 65 distinct configurations, generating 23,400 individual experiments. We construct stability boundaries and quantitatively parameterize them as parabolic functions, characterized by a vertical offset and a curvature parameter. Tilt angle provides the most robust mechanism for tuning the curvature parameter, while beam thickness and pre-compression modulate vertical offset. Modal decomposition analysis reveals that antisymmetric clamp configurations can trigger mode switching, in which competing geometric and inertial effects drive transitions through different deformation pathways. Our work establishes a scalable experimental framework for high-throughput characterization of dynamic nonlinear instabilities in mechanics. The complete experimental dataset is made publicly available to support data-driven design and machine learning models for nonlinear mechanics with applications to bistability-based metamaterials, mechanical memory, and electronics-free sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Trapping of Microorganisms Steering Toward their Own Trail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter systems comprise self-propelled particles that move on a substrate while leaving chemical trails that influence other particles through chemotaxis (e.g., slime-depositing bacteria). Orientational chemotaxis manifests as a torque that steers the particle toward the chemical gradient. As each particle is coupled to its own trail, the dynamics exhibits an instability: when the particle gently diffuses, it abruptly transitions to trajectories with a radius of curvature comparable to its own size, becoming apparently trapped. We argue that, contrary to intuition, this trajectory instability occurs for any chemotactic coupling strength. Depending on the coupling regime, this arises either through a potential-barrier first-passage problem or from a rare event analysis.</description>

      <title>Multimodal motion and behavior switching of multistable ciliary walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective motion of arrays of cilia - tiny, hairlike protrusions - drives the locomotion of numerous microorganisms, enabling multimodal motion and autonomous switching between gaits to navigate complex environments. To endow minimalist centimeter-scale robots with similarly rich dynamics, we introduce millimeter-scale flexible cilia that buckle under the robots weight, coupling multistability and actuation within a single physical mechanism. When placed on a vibrating surface, these ciliary walkers select their propulsion direction through the buckled states of their cilia, allowing multimodal motion and switching between modes in response to perturbations. We first show that bimodal walkers with left-right symmetric cilia can autonomously reverse direction upon encountering obstacles. Next, we demonstrate that walkers with isotropic cilia exhibit both translational and rotational motion and switch between them in response to environmental interactions. At increasing densities, swarms of such walkers collectively transition from predominantly spinning to translational motion. Finally, we show that the shape, placement and number of cilia controls the modes of motion of the walkers. Our results establish a rational, physically grounded strategy for designing minimalist soft robots where complex behaviors emerge from feedback between internal mechanical states and environmental interactions, laying the foundation for autonomous robotic collectives without the need for centralized control.</description>

      <title>Swimming against a superfluid flow: Self-propulsion via vortex-antivortex shedding in a quantum fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Binding Kinetics Oppositely Regulates type II Topoisomerase Relaxation and Decatenation Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type II Topoisomerases (topo II) are critical to simplify genome topology during transcription and replication. They identify topological problems and resolve them by passing a double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in another segment. The precise mechanisms underpinning topo IIs ability to maintain a topologically simple genome are not fully understood. Here, we investigate how binding kinetics affects the resolution of two distinct forms of topological entanglement: decatenation and torsional relaxation. First, by single-molecule measurements, we quantify how monovalent cation concentration affects the dissociation rate of topo II from DNA. Second, we discover that increasing dissociation rates accelerate decatenation while slowing down relaxation catalytic activities. Finally, by using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that this opposite behaviour is due to a trade-off between search of target through facilitated diffusion and processivity of the enzyme in catenated versus supercoiled DNA. Thus, our findings reveal that a modulation of topo II binding kinetics can oppositely regulate its topological simplification activity, and in turn can have a significant impact in vivo.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of committor for ion dissociation and interpretable analysis of solvent effects using atom-centered symmetry functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.</description>

      <title>Reduced density fluctuations via anti-aligning in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight the importance of long-range correlations in active matter systems of self-propelling particles even in the absence of global order or steric interactions by demonstrating that long-range density fluctuations are reduced. We show this analytically for a one-dimensional lattice process employing a Poisson representation. Within this framework, we are able to derive the fluctuating hydrodynamics for the Poisson fields. The emergent imaginary noise indicates the non-Poissonian nature of the number fluctuations and manifests in a non-trivial structure factor $S(k)$ which we are computing analytically. Numerically, we corroborate the relevance of these findings for off-lattice Vicsek-type models with anti-aligning interactions for which we observe apparent non-universal hyperuniformity which we suggest to interpret as a reduction with integer power-law to a finite value.</description>

      <title>Stress Isotropization in Weakly Jammed Granular Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When sheared, granular media experience localized plastic events known as shear transformations which generate anisotropic internal stresses. Under strong confining pressure, the response of granular media to local force multipoles is essentially linear, resulting in quadrupolar propagated stresses. This can lead to additional plastic events along the direction of relative stress increase. Closer to the unjamming transition however, as the confining pressure and the shear modulus vanish, nonlinearities become relevant. Yet, the consequences of these nonlinearities on the stress response to plastic events remains poorly understood. We show with granular dynamics simulations that this brings about an isotropization of the propagated stresses, in agreement with a previously developed continuum elastic model. This could significantly modify the yielding transition of weakly-jammed amorphous media, which has been conceptualized as an avalanche of such plastic events.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic limits of the axisymmetric solution of the Brinkman equation for a point force near a no-slip wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the far-field and near-field solutions for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</description>

      <title>Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.</description>
