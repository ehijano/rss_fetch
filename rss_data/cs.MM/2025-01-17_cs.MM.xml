      <title>LAVCap: LLM-based Audio-Visual Captioning using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a task that generates textual descriptions for audio content, and recent studies have explored using visual information to enhance captioning quality. However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing.

      <title>MagnetDB: A Longitudinal Torrent Discovery Dataset with IMDb-Matched Movies and TV Shows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BitTorrent remains a prominent channel for illicit distribution of copyrighted material, yet the supply side of such content remains understudied. We introduce MagnetDB, a longitudinal dataset of torrents discovered through the BitTorrent DHT between 2018 and 2024, containing more than 28.6 million torrents and metadata of more than 950 million files. While our primary focus is on enabling research based on the supply of pirated movies and TV shows, the dataset also encompasses other legitimate and illegitimate torrents. By applying IMDb-matching and annotation to movie and TV show torrents, MagnetDB facilitates detailed analyses of pirated content evolution in the BitTorrent network. Researchers can leverage MagnetDB to examine distribution trends, subcultural practices, and the gift economy within piracy ecosystems. Through its scale and temporal scope, MagnetDB presents a unique opportunity for investigating the broader dynamics of BitTorrent and advancing empirical knowledge on digital piracy.</description>

      <title>PAL: Prompting Analytic Learning with Missing Modality for Multi-Modal Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal class-incremental learning (MMCIL) seeks to leverage multi-modal data, such as audio-visual and image-text pairs, thereby enabling models to learn continuously across a sequence of tasks while mitigating forgetting. While existing studies primarily focus on the integration and utilization of multi-modal information for MMCIL, a critical challenge remains: the issue of missing modalities during incremental learning phases. This oversight can exacerbate severe forgetting and significantly impair model performance. To bridge this gap, we propose PAL, a novel exemplar-free framework tailored to MMCIL under missing-modality scenarios. Concretely, we devise modality-specific prompts to compensate for missing information, facilitating the model to maintain a holistic representation of the data. On this foundation, we reformulate the MMCIL problem into a Recursive Least-Squares task, delivering an analytical linear solution. Building upon these, PAL not only alleviates the inherent under-fitting limitation in analytic learning but also preserves the holistic representation of missing-modality data, achieving superior performance with less forgetting across various multi-modal incremental scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL significantly outperforms competitive methods across various datasets, including UPMC-Food101 and N24News, showcasing its robustness towards modality absence and its anti-forgetting ability to maintain high incremental accuracy.</description>

      <title>Metric Learning with Progressive Self-Distillation for Audio-Visual Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric learning projects samples into an embedded space, where similarities and dissimilarities are quantified based on their learned representations. However, existing methods often rely on label-guided representation learning, where representations of different modalities, such as audio and visual data, are aligned based on annotated labels. This approach tends to underutilize latent complex features and potential relationships inherent in the distributions of audio and visual data that are not directly tied to the labels, resulting in suboptimal performance in audio-visual embedding learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture that integrates cross-modal triplet loss with progressive self-distillation. Our method enhances representation learning by leveraging inherent distributions and dynamically refining soft audio-visual alignments -- probabilistic alignments between audio and visual data that capture the inherent relationships beyond explicit labels. Specifically, the model distills audio-visual distribution-based knowledge from annotated labels in a subset of each batch. This self-distilled knowledge is used t</description>

      <title>Frechet Music Distance: A Metric For Generative Symbolic Music Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Frechet Music Distance (FMD), a novel evaluation metric for generative symbolic music models, inspired by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) in computer vision and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) in generative audio. FMD calculates the distance between distributions of reference and generated symbolic music embeddings, capturing abstract musical features. We validate FMD across several datasets and models. Results indicate that FMD effectively differentiates model quality, providing a domain-specific metric for evaluating symbolic music generation, and establishing a reproducible standard for future research in symbolic music modeling.</description>
