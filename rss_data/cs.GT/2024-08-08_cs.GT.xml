      <title>On Rider Strategic Behavior in Ride-Sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, ride-sharing services have become increasingly important, with U.S. market leaders such as Uber and Lyft expanding to over 900 cities worldwide and facilitating billions of rides annually. This rise reflects their ability to meet users' convenience, efficiency, and affordability needs. However, in busy areas and surge zones, the benefits of these platforms can diminish, prompting riders to relocate to cheaper, more convenient locations or seek alternative transportation.
  While much research has focused on the strategic behavior of drivers, the strategic actions of riders, especially when it comes to riders walking outside of surge zones, remain under-explored. This paper examines the impact of rider-side strategic behavior on surge dynamics. We investigate how riders' actions influence market dynamics, including supply, demand, and pricing. We show significant impacts, such as spillover effects where demand increases in areas adjacent to surge zones and prices surge in nearby areas. Our theoretical insights and experimental results highlight that rider strategic behavior helps redistribute demand, reduce surge prices, and clear demand in a more balanced way across zones.</description>

      <title>Balancing Efficiency with Equality: Auction Design with Group Fairness Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of fairness in AI arises from discriminatory practices in applications like job recommendations and risk assessments, emphasising the need for algorithms that do not discriminate based on group characteristics. This concern is also pertinent to auctions, commonly used for resource allocation, which necessitate fairness considerations. Our study examines auctions with groups distinguished by specific attributes, seeking to (1) define a fairness notion that ensures equitable treatment for all, (2) identify mechanisms that adhere to this fairness while preserving incentive compatibility, and (3) explore the balance between fairness and seller's revenue. We introduce two fairness notions-group fairness and individual fairness-and propose two corresponding auction mechanisms: the Group Probability Mechanism, which meets group fairness and incentive criteria, and the Group Score Mechanism, which also encompasses individual fairness. Through experiments, we validate these mechanisms' effectiveness in promoting fairness and examine their implications for seller revenue.</description>

      <title>Meta-mechanisms for Combinatorial Auctions over Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there has been a large amount of research designing mechanisms for auction scenarios where the bidders are connected in a social network. Different from the existing studies in this field that focus on specific auction scenarios e.g. single-unit auction and multi-unit auction, this paper considers the following question: is it possible to design a scheme that, given a classical auction scenario and a mechanism $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ suited for it, produces a mechanism in the network setting that preserves the key properties of $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$? To answer this question, we design meta-mechanisms that provide a uniform way of transforming mechanisms from classical models to mechanisms over networks and prove that the desirable properties are preserved by our meta-mechanisms. Our meta-mechanisms provide solutions to combinatorial auction scenarios in the network setting: (1) combinatorial auction with single-minded buyers and (2) combinatorial auction with general monotone valuation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that designs combinatorial auctions over a social network.</description>

      <title>Computational Modelling for Combinatorial Game Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a generic computational model that can be used effectively for establishing the existence of winning strategies for concrete finite combinatorial games. Our modelling is (equational) logic-based involving advanced techniques from algebraic specification, and it can be executed by equational programming systems such as those from the OBJ-family. We show how this provides a form of experimental mathematics for strategy problems involving combinatorial games.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Cooperation in Mixed-Motive Games with Indirect Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altruistic cooperation is costly yet socially desirable. As a result, agents struggle to learn cooperative policies through independent reinforcement learning (RL). Indirect reciprocity, where agents consider their interaction partner's reputation, has been shown to stabilise cooperation in homogeneous, idealised populations. However, more realistic settings are comprised of heterogeneous agents with different characteristics and group-based social identities. We study cooperation when agents are stratified into two such groups, and allow reputation updates and actions to depend on group information. We consider two modelling approaches: evolutionary game theory, where we comprehensively search for social norms (i.e., rules to assign reputations) leading to cooperation and fairness; and RL, where we consider how the stochastic dynamics of policy learning affects the analytically identified equilibria. We observe that a defecting majority leads the minority group to defect, but not the inverse. Moreover, changing the norms that judge in and out-group interactions can steer a system towards either fair or unfair cooperation. This is made clearer when moving beyond equilibrium analysis to independent RL agents, where convergence to fair cooperation occurs with a narrower set of norms. Our results highlight that, in heterogeneous populations with reputations, carefully defining interaction norms is fundamental to tackle both dilemmas of cooperation and of fairness.</description>

      <title>Capacity Planning in Stable Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the shortage of seats that the Chilean school choice system is facing, we introduce the problem of jointly increasing school capacities and finding a student-optimal assignment in the expanded market. Due to the theoretical and practical complexity of the problem, we provide a comprehensive set of tools to solve the problem, including different mathematical programming formulations, a cutting plane algorithm, and two heuristics that allow obtaining near-optimal solutions quickly. On the theoretical side, we show the correctness of our formulations, different properties of the objective and feasible region that facilitate computation, and also several properties of the underlying mechanism to find a student-optimal matching under capacity expansions. On the computational side, we use data from the Chilean school choice system to demonstrate the impact of our framework and derive insights that could help alleviate the problem. Our results show that each additional seat can benefit multiple students and that we can effectively target the assignment of previously unassigned students or improve the assignment of several students through improvement chains. Nevertheless, our results show that the marginal effect of each additional seat is decreasing and that simply adding seats is insufficient to ensure every student gets assigned to some school. Finally, we discuss several extensions of our framework, showcasing its flexibility to accommodate different needs.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Prophet Inequalities for Minor-Closed Classes of Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the matroid prophet inequality problem. This problem has been extensively studied in the case of adaptive mechanisms. In particular, there is a tight $2$-competitive mechanism for all matroids.
  However, it is not known what classes of matroids admit non-adaptive mechanisms with constant guarantee. Recently, it was shown that there are constant-competitive non-adaptive mechanisms for graphic matroids. In this work, we show that various known classes of matroids admit constant-competitive non-adaptive mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Understanding bidding behavior in multi-unit auctions remains an ongoing challenge for researchers. Despite their widespread use, theoretical insights into the bidding behavior, revenue ranking, and efficiency of commonly used multi-unit auctions are limited. This paper utilizes artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning, as a model free learning approach to simulate bidding in three prominent multi-unit auctions employed in practice. We introduce six algorithms that are suitable for learning and bidding in multi-unit auctions and compare them using an illustrative example. This paper underscores the significance of using artificial intelligence in auction design, particularly in enhancing the design of multi-unit auctions.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of No-Regret Dynamics in Information Retrieval Games with Proportional Ranking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Publishers who publish their content on the web act strategically, in a behavior that can be modeled within the online learning framework. Regret, a central concept in machine learning, serves as a canonical measure for assessing the performance of learning agents within this framework. We prove that any proportional content ranking function with a concave activation function induces games in which no-regret learning dynamics converge. Moreover, for proportional ranking functions, we prove the equivalence of the concavity of the activation function, the social concavity of the induced games and the concavity of the induced games. We also study the empirical trade-offs between publishers' and users' welfare, under different choices of the activation function, using a state-of-the-art no-regret dynamics algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the choice of the ranking function and changes in the ecosystem structure affect these welfare measures, as well as the dynamics' convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference and A/B Testing in Fisher Markets and Paced Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for two market equilibrium models: linear Fisher market (LFM) equilibrium and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE). LFM arises from fair resource allocation systems such as allocation of food to food banks and notification opportunities to different types of notifications. For LFM, we assume that the data observed is captured by the classical finite-dimensional Fisher market equilibrium, and its steady-state behavior is modeled by a continuous limit Fisher market. The second type of equilibrium we study, FPPE, arises from internet advertising where advertisers are constrained by budgets and advertising opportunities are sold via first-price auctions. For platforms that use pacing-based methods to smooth out the spending of advertisers, FPPE provides a hindsight-optimal configuration of the pacing method. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a continuous limit FPPE models the steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and a finite FPPE provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE. Both LFM and FPPE have an Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization, the pillar upon which we derive our statistical theory. We start by deriving basic convergence results for the finite market to the limit market. We then derive asymptotic distributions, and construct confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of estimation based on finite markets. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments verify the validity and practicality of our theory.</description>

      <title>Environment Complexity and Nash Equilibria in a Sequential Social Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods, while effective in zero-sum or positive-sum games, often yield suboptimal outcomes in general-sum games where cooperation is essential for achieving globally optimal outcomes. Matrix game social dilemmas, which abstract key aspects of general-sum interactions, such as cooperation, risk, and trust, fail to model the temporal and spatial dynamics characteristic of real-world scenarios. In response, our study extends matrix game social dilemmas into more complex, higher-dimensional MARL environments. We adapt a gridworld implementation of the Stag Hunt dilemma to more closely match the decision-space of a one-shot matrix game while also introducing variable environment complexity. Our findings indicate that as complexity increases, MARL agents trained in these environments converge to suboptimal strategies, consistent with the risk-dominant Nash equilibria strategies found in matrix games. Our work highlights the impact of environment complexity on achieving optimal outcomes in higher-dimensional game-theoretic MARL environments.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Guarantees for Best-Response Learning Dynamics in Zero-Sum Matrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study best-response type learning dynamics for two player zero-sum matrix games. We consider two settings that are distinguished by the type of information that each player has about the game and their opponent's strategy. The first setting is the full information case, in which each player knows their own and the opponent's payoff matrices and observes the opponent's mixed strategy. The second setting is the minimal information case, where players do not observe the opponent's strategy and are not aware of either of the payoff matrices (instead they only observe their realized payoffs). For this setting, also known as the radically uncoupled case in the learning in games literature, we study a two-timescale learning dynamics that combine smoothed best-response type updates for strategy estimates with a TD-learning update to estimate a local payoff function. For these dynamics, without additional exploration, we provide polynomial-time finite-sample guarantees for convergence to an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.</description>
