      <title>Inference accuracy about an aircraft crash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problem-based learning benefits from situations taken from real life, which arouse student interest. The shooting of Rwanda president aircraft on April 6th, 1994 is still unsolved. We discuss the methods to infer information and conclusions about where the aircraft was shot and its trajectory during its fall, as well as about the place from which the missiles were launched, and their trajectory and type. To this goal, we compiled expert reports, witness indications and other public sources, then translated plain language sentences into quantitative equalities and inequalities applied to geometry and mechanics at undergraduate level. The accuracy of each result is discussed and propagated in order to ensure a proper assessment of the hypotheses and a traceability of their consequences. Overall, the accuracy discussion can train the students critical mind, and teach inference methods which are routinely used in several fields of physics research. In addition, it demonstrates the importance and limits of scientific expertise during a judiciary process. The publicly available information interpreted by our calculations shows that the question of missile launching position is still open.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entrepreneurship Lab: Training a Future Workforce for the Quantum Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Entrepreneurship Lab (QEL) is a one-semester, project-based course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), designed to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial application in the quantum sector. As part of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students, equipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the emerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary tracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge, industry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile business students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies, risks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day. This work outlines the course structure, objectives, and outcomes, providing a model for other institutions seeking to cultivate a highly skilled, innovation-driven workforce in quantum science and technology.</description>
