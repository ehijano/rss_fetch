      <title>The Impact of the Virtualization of Scholarly Conferences on the Gender Structure of Conference Contributors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates whether the virtualization of academic conferences in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the gender structure of conference participants. We explored this question utilizing authorship data from the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index for 180 conferences in 30 conference series held between 2017 and 2023. At least one edition of each analyzed conference series was launched in a virtual or hybrid form. This sample enables a comparison of differences in the gender participation of conference authors while controlling for heterogeneity among conference series. Using linear and logistic regression models, we identified a positive difference in women's involvement in virtual and hybrid conferences compared to onsite events. However, this effect was due less to the increased participation of women in virtual and hybrid conferences than to the decreased participation of women in the onsite editions of the analyzed conference series.</description>

      <title>Top Research Performance Over Time: A Multidimensional Micro-Data Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, the contributions of a highly productive minority of scientists to the national Polish research output over the past three decades (1992-2021) is explored. In almost all previous research, the approaches to high research productivity are missing the time component. Cross-sectional studies were not complemented by longitudinal studies: Scientists comprising the classes of top performers have not been tracked over time. Three classes of top performers (the upper 1%, 5%, and 10%) are examined, and a surprising temporal stability of productivity patterns is found. The 1/10 and 10/50 rules consistently apply across the three decades: The upper 1% of scientists, on average, account for 10% of the national output, and the upper 10% account for almost 50% of total output, with significant disciplinary variations. The Relative Presence Index (RPI) we constructed shows that men are overrepresented and women underrepresented in all top performers classes. Top performers are studied longitudinally through their detailed publishing histories, with micro-data coming from the raw Scopus dataset. Econometric models identify the three most important predictors that change the odds ratio estimates of membership in the top performance classes: gender, academic age, and research collaboration. The downward trend in fixed effects over successive six-year periods indicates increasing competition in academia. A large population of all internationally visible Polish scientists (N=152,043) with their 587,558 articles is studied. Implications for high-productivity studies are shown, and limitations are discussed.</description>

      <title>FedAIoT: A Federated Learning Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a significant relevance of federated learning (FL) in the realm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). However, most existing FL works do not use datasets collected from authentic IoT devices and thus do not capture unique modalities and inherent challenges of IoT data. To fill this critical gap, in this work, we introduce FedAIoT, an FL benchmark for AIoT. FedAIoT includes eight datasets collected from a wide range of IoT devices. These datasets cover unique IoT modalities and target representative applications of AIoT. FedAIoT also includes a unified end-to-end FL framework for AIoT that simplifies benchmarking the performance of the datasets. Our benchmark results shed light on the opportunities and challenges of FL for AIoT. We hope FedAIoT could serve as an invaluable resource to foster advancements in the important field of FL for AIoT. The repository of FedAIoT is maintained at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/FedAIoT.</description>
