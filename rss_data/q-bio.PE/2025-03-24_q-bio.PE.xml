      <title>Dynamics and control of maize infection by Busseola fusca: multi-seasonal modeling and biocontrol strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maize production in sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges due to the maize stalk borer (Busseola fusca), a major pest that causes substantial yield losses. Chemical control methods have raised concerns about environmental impact and pest resistance, making biological control a promising alternative. In this study, we develop a multi-seasonal mathematical model using an impulsive system of differential equations to describe stalk borer population dynamics and evaluate pest control strategies. We analyze the stability of the pest-free solution using Floquet theory and study the effects of periodic predator releases on pest suppression. Numerical simulations illustrate the impact of cultural practice and predator release frequency. Moreover, our simulations show that, under good cultural practices, releasing predators once or three times a year is an effective biocontrol strategy. However, in cases of poor cultural practices, biocontrol has only a limited effect, and the best outcome is achieved when predators are released once a year at the beginning of the cropping season.</description>

      <title>Simulating foot-and-mouth dynamics and control in Bolivia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examining the dissemination dynamics of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is critical for revising national response plans. We developed a stochastic SEIR metapopulation model to simulate FMD outbreaks in Bolivia and explore how the national response plan impacts the dissemination among all susceptible species. We explored variations in the control strategies, mapped high-risk areas, and estimated the number of vaccinated animals during the reactive ring vaccination. Initial outbreaks ranged from 1 to 357 infected farms, with control measures implemented for up to 100 days, including control zones, a 30-day movement ban, depopulation, and ring vaccination. Combining vaccination (50-90 farms/day) and depopulation (1-2 farms/day) controlled 60.3% of outbreaks, while similar vaccination but higher depopulation rates (3-5 farms/day) controlled 62.9% and eliminated outbreaks nine days faster. Utilizing depopulation alone controlled 56.76% of outbreaks, but had a significantly longer median duration of 63 days. Combining vaccination (25-45 farms/day) and depopulation (6-7 farms/day) was the most effective, eliminating all outbreaks within a median of three days (maximum 79 days). Vaccination alone controlled only 0.6% of outbreaks and had a median duration of 98 days. Ultimately, results showed that the most effective strategy involved ring vaccination combined with depopulation, requiring a median of 925,338 animals to be vaccinated. Outbreaks were most frequent in high-density farming areas such as Potosi, Cochabamba, and La Paz. Our results suggest that emergency ring vaccination alone can not eliminate FMD if reintroduced in Bolivia, and combining depopulation with vaccination significantly shortens outbreak duration. These findings provide valuable insights to inform Bolivia national FMD response plan, including vaccine requirements and the role of depopulation in controlling outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Change of some cropping systems in a long-term trial comparing different systems: rationale and implications for statistical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The project Agriculture 4.0 without chemical synthetical plant protection (NOcsPS) tests a number of cropping systems that avoid the use of chemical synthetical pesticides while at the same time using mineral fertilizers. The experiment started in 2020 (sowing fall 2019). In 2024 (sowing fall 2023), some of the cropping systems were modified. Analysis of this experiment may be done using linear mixed models. In order to include the data from 2020-2023 in joint analyses with the data collected for the modified systems from 2024 onwards, the mixed modelling approach needs to be reconsidered. In this paper, we develop models for this purpose. A key feature is the use of network meta-analytic concepts that allow a combination of direct and indirect comparisons among systems from the different years. The approach is first illustrated using a toy example. This is followed by detailed analyses of data from two the two trials sites Dahnsdorf and Hohenheim.</description>

      <title>Route to Chaos and Unified Dynamical Framework of Multi-Species Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate species-rich mathematical models of ecosystems. Much of the existing literature focuses on the properties of equilibrium fixed points, in particular their stability and feasibility. Here we emphasize the emergence of limit cycles following Hopf bifurcations tuned by the variability of interspecies interaction. As the variability increases, and owing to the large dimensionality of the system, limit cycles typically acquire a growing spectrum of frequencies. This often leads to the appearance of strange attractors, with a chaotic dynamics of species abundances characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent. We find that limit cycles and strange attractors preserve biodiversity as they maintain dynamical stability without species extinction. We give numerical evidences that this route to chaos dominates in ecosystems with strong enough interactions and where predator-prey behavior dominates over competition and mutualism. Based on arguments from random matrix theory, we further conjecture that this scenario is generic in ecosystems with large number of species, and identify the key parameters driving it. Overall, our work proposes a unifying framework, where a wide range of population dynamics emerge from a single model.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction via the minimum description length principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.</description>

      <title>Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rivers exhibit fractal-like properties that are associated with scaling laws linking geometry and size. The optimal channel network (OCN) model, which is a mathematically tractable representation of river networks often used in theoretical studies, is based on the fractal properties of rivers and consequently reproduces geometric scaling laws. However, purely geometric relationships may not fully capture the interaction between river structure and species' movement strategies that is most relevant to many large-scale ecological processes. In contrast, connectivity, which is a concept that blends habitat geometry and individual movement, has been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes across a broad array of ecosystems. Here, we analyze networks from more than 1000 major rivers around the world, including the Amazon, Mississippi, and Nile, to investigate how river network connectivity metrics scale with system size. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the harmonic centrality and betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. To assess the extent to which OCNs can capture these empirical connectivity patterns, we generated synthetic river networks by fitting an OCN model to each real river. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws to species movement strategies ranging from ideal shortest-path navigation to suboptimal random-path navigation. Surprisingly, we found that random navigation breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic centrality, but not for betweenness centrality.</description>
