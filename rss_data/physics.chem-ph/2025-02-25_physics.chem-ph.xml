      <title>Transferability of vibrational normalizing-flow coordinates: A pathway towards intrinsic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing molecular vibrational energies and wavefunctions using variational approaches is a computationally demanding task, with the primary bottleneck being the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. The achievable accuracy depends on the dimensionality and complexity of the vibrational problem, the number and quality of the utilized basis functions and on the choice of vibrational coordinates. Composing basis sets with normalizing flows is a newly emerged idea to improve their expressivity and subsequently reduce the computational effort of variational methods. This approach generates coordinates tailored to a given vibrational problem for a selected truncated basis. We illustrate that the optimized coordinates results in more accurate predictions and faster convergence when transferred across different basis-set truncations, without the need for re-optimization. In addition, we show that the optimized coordinates are transferable across isotopologues and across molecules with similar structural motifs.</description>

      <title>Taming the Virtual Space for Incremental Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental full configuration interaction (iFCI) closely approximates the FCI limit with polynomial cost through a many-body expansion of the correlation energy, providing highly accurate total energies within a given basis set. To extend iFCI beyond previous basis set limitations, this work introduces a novel natural orbital screening approach, iNO-FCI. By consideration of the importance of virtual orbital selection in the convergence of iFCI, iNO-FCI maximizes the consistency between orbitals selected for each correlated body. iNO-FCI employs a principle of cancellation of errors and ensures that the same set of virtual NOs are used for interdependent terms. This strategy significantly reduces computational cost without compromises in precision. Computational savings of up to 95 percent are demonstrated, allowing access to larger basis sets that were previously computationally prohibitive. iNO-FCI is herein introduced and benchmarked for several difficult test cases involving double-bond dissociation, biradical systems, conjugated $\pi$ systems, and the spin gap of a Cu-based transition metal complex.</description>

      <title>Advancing C-C Coupling of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction for C2+ Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of multicarbon (C2+) products through electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial to addressing global environmental challenges and advancing sustainable energy solutions. However, efficiently producing these high-value chemicals via C-C coupling reactions is a significant challenge. This requires catalysts with optimized surface configurations and electronic properties capable of breaking the scaling relations among various intermediates. In this report, we introduce the fundamentals of electrocatalytic CO2RR and the mechanism of C-C coupling. We examine the effects of catalytic surface interactions with key intermediates and reaction pathways, and discuss emerging strategies for enhancing C-C coupling reactions toward C2+ products. Despite varieties of these strategies, we summarize direct clues for the proper design of the catalyst for the electrocatalytic CO2RR towards C2+ products, aiming to provide valuable insights to broad readers in the field.</description>

      <title>Imaging the photochemical dynamics of cyclobutanone with MeV ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photoinduced chemical dynamics of cyclobutanone upon excitation at 200 nm to the 3s Rydberg state using MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (UED). We observe both the elastic scattering signal, which contains information about the structural dynamics, and the inelastic scattering signal, which encodes information about the electronic state. Our results suggest a sub-picosecond timescale for the photodissociation dynamics, and an excited state lifetime of about 230 femtoseconds. The dissociation is found to be dominated by the C3 channel where cyclopropane and CO are produced. The branching ratio of the C3 channel to the C2 channel where ethene and ketene are produced, is estimated to be approximately 5:3. Our data suggest that the C3 and C2 channels account for approximately 80% of the photoproducts, with the remaining 20% exhibiting ring-opened structures. It is found that the timescale associated with the dissociation process in the C2 channel is shorter compared to that in the C3 channel. Leveraging the enhanced temporal resolution of MeV UED, our results provide a real-time mapping of the nuclear wavepacket dynamics, capturing the complete photochemical dynamics from S2 minimum through the S1/S0 conical intersection, and finally to the dissociation. Our experimental results provide new insights into the Norrish Type I reaction and can be used to benchmark non-adiabatic dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Making Puzzle Pieces Fit or Reshaping MiMiC for Multiscale Simulations with CP2K and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MiMiC is a framework for modeling large-scale chemical processes that require treatment at multiple resolutions. It does not aim to implement single-handedly all methods required to treat individual subsystems, but instead, it relegates this task to specialized computational chemistry software while it serves as an intermediary between these external programs, and computes the interactions between the subsystems. MiMiC minimizes issues typically associated with molecular dynamics performed with multiple programs, by adopting a multiple-program multiple-data paradigm combined with a loose-coupling model. In this article, we present the addition of a new client program, CP2K, to the MiMiC ecosystem, which required a major refactoring of the entire framework and in the end allowed us to unlock its full flexibility. By thorough timing analysis, we verify that the introduced changes do not affect the performance of MiMiC or CP2K, and neither are they a source of significant computational overheads that would be detrimental to simulation efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefits of the framework's modular design, by performing a QM/MM MD simulation combining CP2K with previously interfaced OpenMM, with no additional implementation effort required.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-Dependent Photodissociation of Iodomethylbutane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort XUV pulses of the Free-Electron-LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) were used to investigate laser-induced fragmentation patterns of the prototypical chiral molecule 1-iodo-2-methyl-butane (C$_5$H$_{11}$I) in a pump-probe scheme. Ion velocity-map images and mass spectra of optical-laser-induced fragmentation were obtained for subsequent FEL exposure with photon energies of 63 eV and 75 eV. These energies specifically address the iodine 4d edge of neutral and singly charged iodine, respectively. The presented ion spectra for two optical pump-laser wavelengths, i.e., 800 nm and 267 nm, reveal substantially different cationic fragment yields in dependence on the wavelength and intensity. For the case of 800-nm-initiated fragmentation, the molecule dissociates notably slower than for the 267-nm pump. The results underscore the importance of considering optical-laser wavelength and intensity in the dissociation dynamics of this prototypical chiral molecule that is a promising candidate for future studies of its asymmetric nature.</description>

      <title>Short-range $\Delta$-Machine Learning: A cost-efficient strategy to transfer chemical accuracy to condensed phase systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DFT-based machine-learning potentials (MLPs) are now routinely trained for condensed-phase systems, but surpassing DFT accuracy remains challenging due to the cost or unavailability of periodic reference calculations. Our previous work (PRL 2022, 129, 226001) demonstrated that high-accuracy periodic MLPs can be trained within the CCMD framework using extended yet finite reference calculations. Here, we introduce short-range $\Delta$-Machine Learning (sr$\Delta$ML), which builds on periodic MLPs while accurately reproducing the observables of the high-level method.</description>

      <title>Lambda-ABF-OPES: Faster Convergence with High Accuracy in Alchemical Free Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and target macromolecules while combining both speed and accuracy, is a cornerstone of modern computational drug discovery which is critical for accelerating therapeutic development. Despite recent progresses in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as advanced polarizable force fields and enhanced-sampling techniques, estimating absolute binding free energies (ABFE) remains computationally challenging. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a highly efficient, hybrid methodology that couples the Lambda-Adaptive Biasing Force (Lambda-ABF) scheme with On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES). This approach achieves up to a nine-fold improvement in sampling efficiency and computational speed compared to the original Lambda-ABF when used in conjunction with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, yielding converged results at a fraction of the cost of standard techniques.</description>

      <title>HybridLinker: Topology-Guided Posterior Sampling for Enhanced Diversity and Validity in 3D Molecular Linker Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates. Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</description>

      <title>Addressing Discrepancies Between Theory and Experiments in Boltzmann Luminescence Thermometry with Ln3+ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trivalent lanthanide ion-doped nanoparticles are widely employed as nanoscale thermometers, driving rapid advancements in real-world applications. When the Luminescence Intensity Ratio (LIR) technique is used, these thermometric systems typically require a calibration process to obtain macroscopic calibration parameters. However, despite extensive studies from various research groups, significant discrepancies are observed among the reported values, even for identical Ln$^{3+}$-host systems under similar experimental conditions. Also, in many cases, the obtained calibration parameters substantially differ from their microscopic counterparts, which is commonly ignored in the literature. This study addresses some sources for these inconsistencies by providing fundamental theoretical insights into the measurement process. We demonstrate that the thermalization of the electronic population within the Stark sublevels of a given manifold plays a crucial role in the LIR's temperature dependence and consequently in measuring the macroscopic parameters. As a result, attempts to construct primary thermometers without prior calibration can result in temperature measurement errors exceeding 20 K. Additionally, we show that pathways disrupting Boltzmann thermalization, influenced by experimental conditions, also affect the evaluation of the macroscopic quantities. These findings contribute to a more robust theoretical framework for interpreting and understanding ratiometric Boltzmann luminescence thermometry experiments, also paving the way for developing more accurate and reliable primary thermometers.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representations for Chemical Reaction Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that neural networks can be optimized to represent minimum energy paths as continuous functions, offering a flexible alternative to discrete path-search methods like Nudged Elastic Band (NEB). Our approach parameterizes reaction paths with a network trained on a loss function that discards tangential energy gradients and enables instant estimation of the transition state. We first validate the method on two-dimensional potentials and then demonstrate its advantages over NEB on challenging atomistic systems where (i) poor initial guesses yield unphysical paths, (ii) multiple competing paths exist, or (iii) the reaction follows a complex multi-step mechanism. Results highlight the versatility of the method -- for instance, a simple adjustment to the sampling strategy during optimization can help escape local-minimum solutions. Finally, in a low-dimensional setting, we demonstrate that a single neural network can learn from existing paths and generalize to unseen systems, showing promise for a universal reaction path representation.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum simulation of electronic structure by spectrum amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most advanced techniques using fault-tolerant quantum computers to estimate the ground-state energy of a chemical Hamiltonian involve compression of the Coulomb operator through tensor factorizations, enabling efficient block-encodings of the Hamiltonian. A natural challenge of these methods is the degree to which block-encoding costs can be reduced. We address this challenge through the technique of spectrum amplification, which magnifies the spectrum of the low-energy states of Hamiltonians that can be expressed as sums of squares. Spectrum amplification enables estimating ground-state energies with significantly improved cost scaling in the block encoding normalization factor $\Lambda$ to just $\sqrt{2\Lambda E_{\text{gap}}}$, where $E_{\text{gap}} \ll \Lambda$ is the lowest energy of the sum-of-squares Hamiltonian. To achieve this, we show that sum-of-squares representations of the electronic structure Hamiltonian are efficiently computable by a family of classical simulation techniques that approximate the ground-state energy from below. In order to further optimize, we also develop a novel factorization that provides a trade-off between the two leading Coulomb integral factorization schemes -- namely, double factorization and tensor hypercontraction -- that when combined with spectrum amplification yields a factor of 4 to 195 speedup over the state of the art in ground-state energy estimation for models of Iron-Sulfur complexes and a CO$_{2}$-fixation catalyst.</description>

      <title>Topological descriptors for the electron density of inorganic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Descriptors play an important role in data-driven approaches for materials design. While most descriptors of inorganic crystalline materials emphasize structure and composition, they often neglect the electron density - a complex yet fundamental quantity that governs material properties. In this work, we introduce Betti curves as topological descriptors that compress the electron density into compact representations. Derived from persistent homology, Betti curves capture bonding characteristics by encoding components, cycles, and voids across varied electron density thresholds. Machine learning models trained on Betti curves outperform those trained on raw electron densities by an average of 33 percentage points in classifying structure prototypes, predicting thermodynamic stability, and distinguishing metals from non-metals. Shannon entropy calculations reveal that Betti curves retain comparable information content to electron density while requiring two orders of magnitude less data. By combining expressive power with compact representation, Betti curves highlight the potential of topological data analysis to advance the modeling and design of inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Continuous Scatterplot and Image Moments for Time-Varying Bivariate Field Analysis of Electronic Structure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced electronic transitions are complex quantum-mechanical processes where electrons move between energy levels due to light absorption. This induces dynamics in electronic structure and nuclear geometry, driving important physical and chemical processes in fields like photobiology, materials design, and medicine. The evolving electronic structure can be characterized by two electron density fields: hole and particle natural transition orbitals (NTOs). Studying these density fields helps understand electronic charge movement between donor and acceptor regions within a molecule. Previous works rely on side-by-side visual comparisons of isosurfaces, statistical approaches, or bivariate field analysis with few instances. We propose a new method to analyze time-varying bivariate fields with many instances, which is relevant for understanding electronic structure changes during light-induced dynamics. Since NTO fields depend on nuclear geometry, the nuclear motion results in numerous time steps to analyze. This paper presents a structured approach to feature-directed visual exploration of time-varying bivariate fields using continuous scatterplots (CSPs) and image moment-based descriptors, tailored for studying evolving electronic structures post-photoexcitation. The CSP of the bivariate field at each time step is represented by a four-length image moment vector. The collection of all vector descriptors forms a point cloud in R^4, visualized using principal component analysis. Selecting appropriate principal components results in a representation of the point cloud as a curve on the plane, aiding tasks such as identifying key time steps, recognizing patterns within the bivariate field, and tracking the temporal evolution. We demonstrate this with two case studies on excited-state molecular dynamics, showing how bivariate field analysis provides application-specific insights.</description>

      <title>What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>An Explainable AI Model for Binary LJ Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids serve as an important theoretical framework for understanding molecular interactions. Binary LJ fluids, where two distinct species of particles interact based on the LJ potential, exhibit rich phase behavior and provide valuable insights of complex fluid mixtures. Here we report the construction and utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for binary LJ fluids, focusing on their effectiveness in predicting radial distribution functions (RDFs) across a range of conditions. The RDFs of a binary mixture with varying compositions and temperatures are collected from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish and validate the AI model. In this AI pipeline, RDFs are discretized in order to reduce the output dimension of the model. This, in turn, improves the efficacy, and reduce the complexity of an AI RDF model. The model is shown to predict RDFs for many unknown mixtures very accurately, especially outside the training temperature range. Our analysis suggests that the particle size ratio has a higher order impact on the microstructure of a binary mixture. We also highlight the areas where the fidelity of the AI model is low when encountering new regimes with different underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and quantum electrodynamics effects on NMR shielding tensors of Tl$X$ ($X$ = H, F, Cl, Br, I, At) molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results of relativistic calculations of nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensors ($\sigma$) for the thallium monocation (Tl$^+$), thallium hydride (TlH) and thallium halides (TlF, TlCl, TlBr, TlI, and TlAt) are presented as obtained within a four-component polarization propagator formalism and a two-component linear response approach within the zeroth-order regular approximation. Additionally, some quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects on those NMR shieldings are estimated. A strong dependence of $\sigma$(Tl) on the bonding partner is found, together with a very weak dependence of QED effects with them. In order to explain the trends observed, the excitation patterns associated with relativistic $ee$ (or paramagnetic-like) and $pp$ (or diamagnetic-like) contributions to $\sigma$ are analyzed. For this purpose, also the electronic spin-free and spin-dependent contributions are separated within the two-component zeroth-order regular approximation, and the influence of spin-orbit coupling on involved molecular orbitals is studied, which allows for a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A simple truth hidden in plain sight: All molecules are entangled according to chemical common sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A physically motivated equation that determines the number of electrons of a molecule is proposed based on chemical common sense. It shows that all molecules are entangled in the number of electrons and results in the fundamental assumption of molecular energy convexity that underpins molecular quantum mechanics. The proposed physical principle includes the molecular size consistency principle as a special case. Application of wavefunction theory to the principle shows that an individual molecule with a noninteger number of electrons is locally physical albeit locally unreal. The energy of a molecule is piecewise linear with respect to its continuous number of electrons. The continuity of the number of electrons allows the definition of an electronic chemical potential of a single molecule. A state function equivalent to the energy of a molecule can be defined using the chemical potential as a variable. The aforementioned physical principle can alternatively be expressed as a simple additivity with the new state function. The latter also shows that the quantum entanglement in the number of electrons can be viewed as all molecules sharing the same chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Optimizing reaction and transport fluxes in temperature gradient-driven chemical reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature gradients represent energy sources that can be harvested to generate steady reaction or transport fluxes. Technological developments could lead to the transfer of free energy from heat sources and sinks to chemical systems for the purpose of extraction, thermal batteries, or nonequilibrium synthesis.
  We present a theoretical study of 1D chemical systems subjected to temperature gradients, for sustaining nonequilibrium chemical fluxes. A complete theoretical framework describes the behavior of the system induced by various temperature profiles. An exact mathematical derivation was established for a simple two-compartment model and was generalized to arbitrary reaction-diffusion systems based on numerical models. An experimental system was eventually scaled and tuned to optimize either nonequilibrium chemical transport or reaction.
  The relevant parameters for this description were identified; they focused on the system symmetry for chemical reaction and transport. Nonequilibrium thermodynamic approaches lead to a description analogous to electric circuits. Temperature gradients lead to the onset of a steady chemical force, which maintains steady reaction-diffusion fluxes moderated by chemical resistance. The system activity was then assessed using the entropy production rate as a measure of its dissipated power.
  The chemical characteristics of the system can be tuned for general optimization of the nonequilibrium state or for the specific optimization of either transport or reaction processes. The shape of the temperature gradient can be tailored to precisely control the spatial localization of active processes, targeting either precise spatial localization or propagation over large areas. The resulting temperature-driven chemical system can in turn be used to drive secondary processes into either nonequilibrium reaction fluxes or concentration gradients.</description>

      <title>Generating coupled cluster code for modern distributed memory tensor software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using GPU-based HPC platforms efficiently for coupled cluster computations is a challenge due to heterogeneous hardware structures. The constant need to adapt software to these structures and the required man-hours makes a systematization of high-performance code development desirable, even more so for higher-order coupled cluster. This is generally achieved by introducing a high-level representation of the problem, which is then translated to low-level instructions for the hardware using a compiler/translator component. Designing such software comes with another challenge: Allowing efficient implementation by capturing key symmetries of tensors, while retaining the abstraction from the hardware. We review ways to address these two challenges while presenting design decisions which led us to the development of a general-order coupled cluster code generator. The systematically produced code shows excellent weak scaling behavior running on up to 1200 GPUs using the distributed memory tensor library ExaTENSOR. We present an open-source modular tensor framework "tenpi" for coupled cluster code development with diagrammatic derivation, visualization module, symbolic algebra, intermediate optimization and support for multiple tensor backends. Tenpi brings higher-order CC functionality to the massively parallel ExaCorr module of the DIRAC code for relativistic molecular calculations.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature decomposition of the ethaline deep eutectic solvent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmentally-benign, non-toxic electrolytes with combinatorial design spaces are excellent candidates for green solvents, green leaching agents, and carbon capture sources. Here, we examine one particular green solvent, ethaline, a 2:1 molar ratio of ethylene glycol and choline chloride. Despite its touted green credentials, we find partial decomposition of ethaline into toxic chloromethane and dimethylaminoethanol at room temperature, limiting its sustainable advantage. We experimentally characterize these decomposition products and computationally develop a general, quantum chemically-accurate workflow to understand decomposition. We find that fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds bind chloride near reaction sites, initiating the reaction between choline cations and chloride anions. In summary, in the design of green solvents, we do not recommend the use of choline chloride due to its susceptibility to undergo decomposition in strongly hydrogen-bound mixtures.</description>

      <title>Turning on the Light: Polymorphism-Induced Photoluminescence in Cysteine Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoluminescence of non-aromatic supramolecular chemical assemblies has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for use in molecular sensing and imaging technologies. The underlying structural origins, the mechanisms of light emission in these systems, and the generality of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of L-Cysteine (Cys) formed in heavy water ($\text{D}_2\text{O}$) exhibit distinct packing and hydrogen-bond networks, resulting in significantly enhanced photoluminescence compared to those prepared in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Using advanced excited-state simulations, we elucidate the nature of electronic transitions that activate vibrational modes of Cys in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, particularly those involving thiol (S-H) and amine (C-N) groups, which lead to non-radiative decay. For the crystal formed in $\text{D}_2\text{O}$, these modes appear to be more constrained, and we also observe intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state, indicating a potentially more complex light emission mechanism. Our findings provide new insights into this intriguing phenomenon and introduce innovative design principles for generating emergent fluorophores.</description>

      <title>An Equivariant Pretrained Transformer for Unified 3D Molecular Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretraining on a large number of unlabeled 3D molecules has showcased superiority in various scientific applications. However, prior efforts typically focus on pretraining models in a specific domain, either proteins or small molecules, missing the opportunity to leverage cross-domain knowledge. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Equivariant Pretrained Transformer (EPT), an all-atom foundation model that can be pretrained from multiple domain 3D molecules. Built upon an E(3)-equivariant transformer, EPT is able to not only process atom-level information but also incorporate block-level features (e.g. residuals in proteins). Additionally, we employ a block-level denoising task, rather than the conventional atom-level denoising, as the pretraining objective. To pretrain EPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 5.89M entries, comprising small molecules, proteins, protein-protein complexes, and protein-molecule complexes. Experimental evaluations on downstream tasks including ligand binding affinity prediction, protein property prediction, and molecular property prediction, show that EPT significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in the first task and achieves competitively superior performance for the remaining two tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of EPT in identifying small molecule drug candidates targeting 3CL protease, a critical target in the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Among 1,978 FDA-approved drugs, EPT ranks 7 out of 8 known anti-COVID-19 drugs in the top 200, indicating the high recall of EPT. By using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, EPT further discoveries 7 novel compounds whose binding affinities are higher than that of the top-ranked known anti-COVID-19 drug, showcasing its powerful capabilities in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

      <title>Modeling glasses from first-principles using random structure sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to approximating static properties of glasses without experimental inputs rooted in the first-principles random structure sampling. In our approach, the glassy system is represented by a collection (composite) of periodic, small-cell (few 10s of atoms) local minima on the potential energy surface. These are obtained by generating a set of periodic structures with random lattice parameters and random atomic positions, which are then relaxed to their closest local minima on the potential energy surface using the first-principles methods. Using vitreous SiO2 as an example, we illustrate and discuss how well various atomic and electronic structure properties calculated as averages over the set of such local minima reproduce experimental data. The practical benefit of our approach, which can be rigorously thought of as representing an infinitely quickly quenched liquid, is in that it transfers the computational burden to linearly scaling and easy to converge averages of properties computed on small-cell structures, rather than simulation cells with 100s if not 1000s of atoms while retaining a good overall predictive accuracy. Because of this it enables the future use of high-cost/high-accuracy electronic structure methods thereby bringing modeling of glasses and amorphous phases closer to the state of modeling of crystalline solids.</description>

      <title>Mol-LLaMA: Towards General Understanding of Molecules in Large Molecular Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.
