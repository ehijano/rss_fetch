      <title>Single-cell metabolic flux analysis reveals coexisting optimal sub-groups, cross-feeding, and mixotrophy in a cyanobacterial population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a single-cell level understanding of metabolism in an isogenic cyanobacterial population by integrating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) derived multi-isotope uptake measurements of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 with a statistical inference protocol based on Liebig's law of the minimum, the maximum entropy principle, and constraint-based modeling. We find the population is structured in two metabolically distinct clusters: cells optimizing carbon yield while excessively turning over nitrogen, and cells which act reciprocally, optimizing nitrogen yield and excessively turning over carbon. This partition enables partial heterotrophy within the population via metabolic exchange, likely in the form of organic acids. Exchange increases the feasible metabolic space, and mixotrophic cells achieve the fastest growth rates. Metabolic flux analysis at the single-cell level reveals heterogeneity in carbon fixation rates, Rubisco specificity, and nitrogen assimilation. Our results provide a necessary foundation for understanding how population level phenotypes arise from the collective contributions of distinct individuals.</description>

      <title>Boolean matrix logic programming for active learning of gene functions in genome-scale metabolic network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06724v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning about hypotheses and updating knowledge through empirical observations are central to scientific discovery. In this work, we applied logic-based machine learning methods to drive biological discovery by guiding experimentation. Genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) - comprehensive representations of metabolic genes and reactions - are widely used to evaluate genetic engineering of biological systems. However, GEMs often fail to accurately predict the behaviour of genetically engineered cells, primarily due to incomplete annotations of gene interactions. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To efficiently predict using GEM, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging Boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We developed a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which guides cost-effective experimentation and uses interpretable logic programs to encode a state-of-the-art GEM of a model bacterial organism. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ successfully learned the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for biological discovery, which would then facilitate microbial engineering for practical applications.</description>

      <title>GRiNS: A Python Library for Simulating Gene Regulatory Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergent dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks govern various cellular processes. However, understanding these dynamics is challenging due to the difficulty of parameterizing the computational models for these networks, especially as the network size increases. Here, we introduce a simulation library, Gene Regulatory Interaction Network Simulator (GRiNS), to address these challenges. GRiNS integrates popular parameter-agnostic simulation frameworks, RACIPE and Boolean Ising formalism, into a single Python library capable of leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient and scalable simulations. GRiNS extends the ordinary differential equations (ODE) based RACIPE framework with a more modular design, allowing users to choose parameters, initial conditions, and time-series outputs for greater customisability and accuracy in simulations. For large networks, where ODE-based simulation formalisms do not scale well, GRiNS implements Boolean Ising formalism, providing a simplified, coarse-grained alternative, significantly reducing the computational cost while capturing key dynamical behaviours of large regulatory networks. The documentation and installation instructions for GRiNS can be found at https://moltenecdysone09.github.io/GRiNS/.</description>
