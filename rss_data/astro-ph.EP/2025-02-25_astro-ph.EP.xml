      <title>TOI-6324b: An Earth-Mass Ultra-Short-Period Planet Transiting a Nearby M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the confirmation of TOI-6324 b, an Earth-sized (1.059 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_\oplus$) ultra-short-period (USP) planet orbiting a nearby ($\sim$20 pc) M dwarf. Using the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph, we have measured the mass of TOI-6324 b 1.17 $\pm$ 0.22 M$_\oplus$. Because of its extremely short orbit of just $\sim$6.7 hours, TOI-6324 b is intensely irradiated by its M dwarf host, and is expected to be stripped of any thick, H/He envelope. We were able to constrain its interior composition and found an iron core mass fraction (CMF = 27$\pm$37%) consistent with that of Earth ($\sim$33%) and other confirmed USPs. TOI-6324 b is the closest to Earth-sized USP confirmed to date. TOI-6324 b is a promising target for JWST phase curve and secondary eclipse observations (Emission Spectroscopy Metric = 25) which may reveal its surface mineralogy, day-night temperature contrast, and possible tidal deformation. From 7 sectors of TESS data, we report a tentative detection of the optical phase curve variation with an amplitude of 42$\pm$28 ppm.</description>

      <title>New asteroid clusters and evidence of collisional fragmentation in the L5 Trojan cloud of Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Trojan asteroids of Mars date from an early phase of solar system evolution. Based on a sample of &lt;10 asteroids, MT distribution has been previously shown to be both asymmetric and inhomogeneous with population evolution dominated by thermal radiation forces acting over timescales of Gyr. Remarkably, a single asteroid family associated with (5261) Eureka (H~16) at L5 contains most MTs and all members of the stable population fainter than H=18.
  Aims. Using the currently available sample of MTs and their orbits, we take a fresh look at this population to re-evaluate these earlier conclusions and to search for additional features diagnostic of the evolutionary history of MTs and the Eureka family in particular.
  Methods. We perform harmonic analysis on numerical time series of the osculating elements to compile a new proper element catalogue comprising 16 L5 and 1 L4 Mars Trojan asteroids. We then combine sample variance analysis with statistical hypothesis testing to identify clusters in the distribution of orbits and assess their significance.
  Results. We identify two small clusterings significant at 95% confidence of three H=20-21 asteroids each and investigate their likely origin. One of the clusters is probably the result of rotational breakup of a Eureka family asteroid ~10^8 yr ago. The significantly higher tadpole libration width of asteroids in the other cluster is more consistent with an origin as impact ejecta from Eureka itself and on a timescale comparable to the ~1 Gyr age of its family. We further confirm the previously reported correlations in Eureka family orbital distribution attributed to the long-term action of radiation-driven forces and torques on the asteroids.</description>

      <title>On the diversification and dissipation of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disk evolution exhibits trends with stellar mass as well as diversity of structure and lifetime, with implications for planet formation and demographics. We show how varied outcomes can result from evolving structures in the inner disk that attenuate stellar soft X-rays that otherwise drive photoevaporation in the outer disk. The magnetic truncation of the disk around a rapidly rotating T Tauri star is initially exterior to the co-rotation radius and``propeller" accretion is accompanied by an inner magnetized wind, shielding the disk from X-rays. Stellar contraction while rotation is ``locked" to the disk causes the truncation radius to migrate interior to the co-rotation radius, the inner wind to disappear, and photoevaporation to erode a gap in the disk, accelerating its dissipation. This X-ray attenuation scenario explains the trend of longer lifetime, reduced structure and compact size of disks around lower-mass stars. It also explains an observed lower bound and scatter in the distribution of disk accretion rates. Disks that experience early photoevaporation and form gaps can efficiently trap solids at a pressure bump at 1--10 au, triggering giant planet formation, while those with later-forming or no gaps form multiple smaller planets on close-in orbits, a pattern consistent with observed exoplanet demographics.</description>

      <title>Tempests in the Troposphere: Mapping the Impact of Giant Storms on Jupiter's Deep Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storms are emerging as key drivers in shaping hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Trace gas condensation can suppress convection and disrupt the distribution of energy and material in hydrogen atmospheres. On Jupiter, the presence of water has been invoked to control the occurrence of large-scale storms; however, the impact of storms on the ammonia and temperature distribution is unknown. We use Juno Microwave Radiometer observations of a large-scale storm in 2017 to study the aftermath of such a storm on the atmosphere. Anomalies in the retrieved ammonia abundance and atmospheric temperature show how storms deplete and heat the upper atmosphere while simultaneously depositing material well below the layers they were triggered at. These observations, aided by simulations, show that the water and ammonia cycles are coupled and that their combined effect plays a key role in explaining the depletion of ammonia in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.</description>

      <title>Asteroid shape inversion with light curves using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid shape inversion using photometric data has been a key area of study in planetary science and astronomical research.However, the current methods for asteroid shape inversion require extensive iterative calculations, making the process time-consuming and prone to becoming stuck in local optima. We directly established a mapping between photometric data and shape distribution through deep neural networks. In addition, we used 3D point clouds to represent asteroid shapes and utilized the deviation between the light curves of non-convex asteroids and their convex hulls to predict the concave areas of non-convex asteroids. We compared the results of different shape models using the Chamfer distance between traditional methods and ours and found that our method performs better, especially when handling special shapes. For the detection of concave areas on the convex hull, the intersection over union (IoU) of our predictions reached 0.89. We further validated this method using observational data from the Lowell Observatory to predict the convex shapes of the asteroids 3337 Milo and 1289 Kuta, and conducted light curve fitting experiments. The experimental results demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of the method</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Approach for Accurate Asteroid Spectra taxonomy and albedo estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: China plans to launch a probe (Tianwen-2) around 2025, mainly for exploring the near-Earth asteroid 2016 HO3 . The mission involves close-range exploration, landing, and mining operations that require three-dimensional modeling of the asteroid, which requires prior knowledge of its material composition and uniformity. This information is crucial in progressive or ground exploration processes. Our research focuses on high-precision intelligent inversion of complex physical properties of asteroids based on spectral data, providing support for further analysis of aster oid materials, density, and structure. We have developed a platform for asteroid spectral classification, albedo estimation, and composition analysis, which includes three types of neural networks based on Transformer attention mechanism: One for spectral classification, achieving a four-class classification accuracy of 97.28% and an eleven-class classification accuracy of 95.69%; second one for albedo estimation, with an average absolute error of 0.0308 in S-type asteroid albedo estimation, and the third one for composition analysis, with a predicted spectral angular distance of only 0.0340 and a root mean square error of 0.1759 for the abundance of end members. These results indicate that our network can provide high-precision asteroid spectral classification, albedo estimation, and composition analysis results. In addition, we utilized the platform to analyze and provide results for six asteroids.</description>

      <title>The visibility of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model in LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a new probabilistic technique for sampling interstellar object (ISO) orbits with high efficiency, we assess the observability of ISOs under a realistic cadence for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Using the \={O}tautahi-Oxford population model, we show that there will be complex on-sky structure in the pattern of direction and velocity revealed by the detected ISO population, with the expected enhanced northern flux complicating efforts to derive population parameters from the LSST's predominately southern footprint. For luminosity functions with slopes of $2.5\leq q_s\leq 4.0$, the most discoverable ISOs have $H_r\simeq 14.6-20.7$; for previously estimated spatial densities, between 6 and 51 total ISOs are expected. The slope of the luminosity function of ISOs will be relatively quickly constrained. Discoveries are evenly split around their perihelion passage and are biased to lower velocities. After their discovery by LSST, it will be rare for ISOs to be visible for less than a month; most will have $m_r \leq 23$ for months, and the window for spectroscopic characterization could be as long as two years. These probabilistic assessments are robust against model or spatial density refinements that change the absolute numbers of ISO discoveries.</description>

      <title>Accretion bursts in young intermediate-mass stars make planet formation challenging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of accretion bursts, dust accumulation, and the prospects for planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk with globally suppressed but episodically triggered magnetorotational instability (MRI), particularly in young intermediate-mass stars (YIMSs) but with a brief comparison to low-mass counterparts. We use numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit (FEOSAD code) to model the formation and long-term evolution of a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk, including dust dynamics and growth, since the collapse of a massive slowly-rotating prestellar cloud core. Massive gas concentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the radially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability (GI). These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI). However, gradual warming of the dust rings, thanks to high opacity and GI-induced influx of matter increases the gas temperature above a threshold for the MRI to develop via thermal ionization of alkaline metals. The ensuing MRI bursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI problematic. In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to diminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and more extended inner dead zone, both acting to reduce the dust concentration below the threshold for SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less affected by these adverse effects. Our results suggest that disks around young intermediate-mass stars may be challenging environments for planetesimal formation via SI. This may explain the dearth of planets around stars with $M_\ast &gt; 3.0 \,$$M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>A JWST Panchromatic Thermal Emission Spectrum of the Warm Neptune Archetype GJ 436b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GJ 436b is the archetype warm Neptune exoplanet. The planet's thermal emission spectrum was previously observed via intensive secondary eclipse campaigns with Spitzer. The atmosphere has long been interpreted to be extremely metal-rich, out of chemical equilibrium, and potentially tidally heated. We present the first panchromatic emission spectrum of GJ 436b observed with JWST's NIRCAM (F322W2 and F444W) and MIRI (LRS) instruments between 2.4 and 11.9 $\mu$m. Surprisingly, the JWST spectrum appears significantly fainter around 3.6 $\mu$m than that implied by Spitzer photometry. The molecular absorption features in the spectrum are relatively weak, and we only find tentative evidence of CO$_2$ absorption at 2$\sigma$ significance. Under the assumption of a day-side blackbody, we find $T_{\rm day}$=662.8$\pm$5.0 K, which is similar to the zero Bond albedo equilibrium temperature. We use it to obtain a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the Bond albedo of $A_B{\le}$0.66. To understand the spectrum we employ 1D radiative-convective models but find that atmospheric constraints depend strongly on model assumptions. If thermochemical equilibrium is assumed, we find a cloudy metal-enriched atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 300$\times$solar). We employ 1D photochemical modeling to show that the observed spectrum is also consistent with a cloud-free, relatively lower-metallicity atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 80$\times$solar) with a cold internal temperature ($T_{\rm int}$$\sim$60 K). These are much lower metallicities and internal temperatures than inferences from Spitzer photometry. The low $T_{\rm day}$ and non-detection of transmission features at high spectral resolution does suggest a role for cloud opacity, but this is not definitive.</description>

      <title>Free-floating planetary mass objects in LDN 1495 from Euclid Early Release Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects, are a significant product of star formation. Their sensitivity to initial conditions and early dynamical evolution makes them especially valuable for studying both planetary and stellar formation processes. Aims. We search for brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects in a young star forming region to better constrain their formation mechanisms. Methods. We take advantage of Euclid unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and wide-field of view to search for brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects in the LDN 1495 region of the Taurus molecular clouds. We combine the recent Euclid Early Release Observations with older very deep ground-based images obtained over more than 20 yr to derive proper motions and multi-wavelength photometry, and select members based on their morphology and their position in a proper motion diagram and in 9 color-magnitude diagrams. Results. We identify 15 point sources with proper motions, colors, and luminosity consistent with being members of LDN 1495. Six of these objects were already known M9-L1 members. The remaining nine are newly identified sources that could have spectral types ranging from late-M to early-T with masses potentially as low as 1-2 MJup based on their luminosity and according to evolutionary models. However, follow-up observations are needed to confirm their nature, spectral type and membership. If extrapolated to theentire Taurus star forming region, this result suggests the potential presence of several dozen free-floating planetary mass objects.</description>

      <title>The Solar System's passage through the Radcliffe wave during the middle Miocene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. As the Solar System orbits the Milky Way, it encounters various Galactic environments, including dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM). These encounters can compress the heliosphere, exposing parts of the Solar System to the ISM, while also increasing the influx of interstellar dust into the Solar System and Earth's atmosphere. The discovery of new Galactic structures, such as the Radcliffe wave, raises the question of whether the Sun has encountered any of them. Aims. The present study investigates the potential passage of the Solar System through the Radcliffe wave gas structure over the past 30 million years (Myr). Methods. We used a sample of 56 high-quality, young ($\leq$ 30 Myr) open clusters associated with a region of interest of the Radcliffe wave to trace its motion back and investigate a potential crossing with the Solar System's past orbit. Results. We find that the Solar System's trajectory intersected the Radcliffe wave in the Orion region. We have constrained the timing of this event to between 18.2 and 11.5 Myr ago, with the closest approach occurring between 14.8 and 12.4 Myr ago. Notably, this period coincides with the Middle Miocene climate transition on Earth, providing an interdisciplinary link with paleoclimatology. The potential impact of the crossing of the Radcliffe wave on the climate on Earth is estimated. This crossing could also lead to anomalies in radionuclide abundances, which is an important research topic in the field of geology and nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some astrobiological models suggest that molecular clouds may serve as habitats for extraterrestrial life. This study reviews recent theoretical work addressing the physical and biochemical prerequisites for life in such environments, with particular focus on three subjects: (1) bioenergetic pathways under extreme low-temperature conditions; (2) the emergence and preservation of biomolecular chirality; and (3) detection methodologies for potential biosignatures. In this paper, we formally introduce the molecular cloud biology concept, which integrates all physicochemical and metabolic processes hypothesized to sustain life within molecular clouds. As a potential branch of astrobiology, molecular cloud biology warrants interdisciplinary collaborative research to validate its foundational assumptions and explore its scientific implications.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Disk-wind Origin for Fluorescent H$_2$ in Classical T Tauri Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use FUV spectra of 36 T Tauri stars, predominately from $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$'s ULLYSES program, to examine the kinematic properties of fluorescent H$_2$ emission lines for evidence of disk outflows. Leveraging improvements to the $\textit{HST}$-COS wavelength solution, we co-add isolated lines within four fluorescent progressions ([$\textit{v'}$,$\textit{J'}$] = [1,4], [1,7], [0,2], and [3,16]) to improve signal-to-noise, and we fit each co-added line profile with one or two Gaussian components. Of the high S/N line profiles (S/N $\geq$ 12 at the peak of the profile), over half are best fit with a combination of a broad and narrow Gaussian component. For profiles of the [1,4] and [1,7] progressions, we find a systematic blue-shift of a few km s$^{-1}$ between the broad and narrow centroid velocities and stellar radial velocities. For the [0,2] progression, we find centroid velocities consistently blueshifted with respect to stellar radial velocities on the order of -5 km s$^{-1}$ for the single and narrow components, and -10 km s$^{-1}$ for the broad components. Overall, the blueshifts observed in our sample suggest that the molecular gas traces an outflow from a disk wind in some sources, and not solely disk gas in Keplerian rotation. The low-velocity systematic blue-shifts, and emitting radii as inferred from line FWHMs, observed in our sample are similar to those observed with optical [O I] surveys of T Tauri stars. We estimate H$_2$ mass-loss rates of 10$^{-9}$ to 10$^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, but incomplete knowledge of wind parameters limits comparisons to global models.</description>

      <title>TESSELLATE: Piecing Together the Variable Sky With TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a cold giant planet and mass measurement of a hot super-Earth in the multi-planetary system WASP-132</title>

Abstract: Hot Jupiters generally do not have nearby planet companions, as they may have cleared out other planets during their inward migration from more distant orbits. This gives evidence that hot Jupiters more often migrate inward via high-eccentricity migration due to dynamical interactions between planets rather than more dynamically cool migration mechanisms through the protoplanetary disk. Here we further refine the unique system of WASP-132 by characterizing the mass of the recently validated 1.0-day period super-Earth WASP-132c (TOI-822.02), interior to the 7.1-day period hot Jupiter WASP-132b. Additionally, we announce the discovery of a giant planet at a 5-year period (2.7 AU). We also detected a long-term trend in the radial velocity data indicative of another outer companion. Using over nine years of CORALIE radial velocities (RVs) and over two months of highly sampled HARPS RVs, we determined the masses of the planets from smallest to largest orbital period to be M$_{\rm{c}}$ = $6.26^{+1.84}_{-1.83}$ $M_{\oplus}$, M$_{\rm{b}}$ = $0.428^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, and M$_{\rm{d}}\sin{i}$ = $5.16^{+0.52}_{-0.52}$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, respectively. Using TESS and CHEOPS photometry data, we measured the radii of the two inner transiting planets to be R$_{\rm{c}}$ = $1.841^{+0.094}_{-0.093}$ $R_{\oplus}$ and R$_{\rm{b}}$ = $0.901^{+0.038}_{-0.038}$ $R_{\rm{Jup}}$. We find a bulk density of $\rho_{\rm{c}}$ = $5.47^{+1.96}_{-1.71}$ g cm$^{-3}$ for WASP-132 c, which is slightly above the Earth-like composition line on the mass-radius diagram. WASP-132 is a unique multi-planetary system in that both an inner rocky planet and an outer giant planet are in a system with a hot Jupiter. This suggests it migrated via a rarer dynamically cool mechanism and helps to further our understanding of how hot Jupiter systems form and evolve.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric abundances and bulk properties of the binary brown dwarf Gliese 229 Bab from JWST/MIRI spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy ($4.75-14~\mu$m) of the first known substellar companion, Gliese 229 Bab, which was recently resolved into a tight binary brown dwarf. Previous atmospheric retrieval studies modeling Gliese 229 B as a single brown dwarf have reported anomalously high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) of $\approx 1.1$ using $1-5~\mu$m ground-based spectra. Here, we fit the MIRI spectrum of Gliese 229 Bab with a two-component binary model using the Sonora Elf Owl grid and additionally account for the observed $K$ band flux ratio of the binary brown dwarf. Assuming the two brown dwarfs share the same abundances, we obtain $\rm C/O=0.65\pm0.05$ and $\rm [M/H]=0.00^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ as their abundances ($2\sigma$ statistical errors), which are fully consistent with the host star abundances. We also recover the same abundances if we fit the MIRI spectrum with a single brown dwarf model, indicating that binarity does not strongly affect inferred abundances from mid-infrared data when the $T_\rm{eff}$ are similar between components of the binary. We measure $T_\rm{eff}=900^{+78}_{-29}~$K and $T_\rm{eff}=775^{+20}_{-33}~$K for the two brown dwarfs. We find that the vertical diffusion coefficients of $\log{K_\rm{zz}} \approx4.0$ are identical between the two brown dwarfs and in line with $\log{K_\rm{zz}}$ values inferred for isolated brown dwarfs with similar $T_\rm{eff}$. Our results demonstrate the power of mid-infrared spectroscopy in providing robust atmospheric abundance measurements for brown dwarf companions and by extension, giant planets.</description>

      <title>The past, present and future of observations of externally irradiated disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the community studying the effect of ultraviolet radiation environment, predominantly set by OB stars, on protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation. This is important because a significant fraction of planetary systems, potentially including our own, formed in close proximity to OB stars. This is a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of observations across many regions recently obtained or recently scheduled. In this paper, stimulated by a series of workshops on the topic, we take stock of the current and upcoming observations. We discuss how the community can build on this recent success with future observations to make progress in answering the big questions of the field, with the broad goal of disentangling how external photoevaporation contributes to shaping the observed (exo)planet population. Both existing and future instruments offer numerous opportunities to make progress towards this goal.</description>
