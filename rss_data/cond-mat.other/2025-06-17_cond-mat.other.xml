      <title>Emission Properties of a Hybrid Metallized Diamond(001) Photocathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral emission characteristics of a proof-of-concept hybrid metallized diamond(001) photocathode are presented. The quantum efficiency (QE) is shown to be determined by the photo-injection efficiency across the ohmic contact at the back metallized face, whereas the mean transverse energy (MTE) of the photoemitted electrons is consistent with a (optical)phonon-assisted and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon mechanism [Phys. Rev. Applied 23, 054065 (2025)] following electron drift transport to the untreated diamond(001) front emission face. Emission is observed from both the lower and upper conduction bands of diamond with positive and negative electron affinity respectively. A potential route to the realization of a red-visible photocathode based on this concept with a sub-50meV MTE and a QE greater than 0.1% is discussed.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation times grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure--dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean--field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure--dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure--dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure--dynamics correlation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics with Or-Represented Quantum Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>2D MXene-Based Photocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting and Hydrogen Evolution: A brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting offers a viable and sustainable method for hydrogen production. MXenes, a class of 2D transition-metal carbides/nitrides, have emerged as potential photocatalysts and co-catalysts due to their tunable electronic properties, high conductivity, and surface functionality. This review explores recent advances in MXene-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production, discussing their synthesis, electronic structures, and photocatalytic mechanisms. The key challenges, including stability issues, charge recombination, and bandgap optimisation, are critically analysed. Finally, future research directions are outlined to improve MXene-based systems for large-scale hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Significant role of first-principles electron-phonon coupling in the electronic and thermoelectric properties of LiZnAs and ScAgC semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Optimal Diffusion for Infection Control in Brownian Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the spread of infectious diseases requires integrating movement, physical constraints, and spatial configurations into epidemiological models. In this study, we investigate how particle diffusivity, hardcore interactions, and non-equilibrium initial conditions influence infection dynamics within a system of Brownian particles. Using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we reveal a nontrivial relationship between diffusivity and the speed of infection spread. Specifically, when particles are initially positioned at uniform distances greater than the infection radius -- a non-equilibrium configuration -- there exists an optimal diffusion coefficient that minimizes the infection propagation speed. This counterintuitive result arises from the competition between diffusive timescales and the rate of infection transmission. The presence of an optimal diffusivity is observed both in systems with and without hardcore interactions, provided that the infection radius exceeds the mean lattice spacing. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding and controlling the spread of infections in confined and diffusive environments, with potential implications for designing movement-based strategies for infection control.</description>

      <title>Conformal anomaly and gravitational pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that the time-reversal-even component of the pair production rate $\Gamma$ of particles in background fields in conformal 3+1 dimensional field theories is given by the anomalous trace $\langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle$ of the energy-momentum tensor: $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu} \rangle \Theta( \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. We show that this relation, written in mostly-plus metric, correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation of massless particles both in scalar and spinor versions of quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. The conjectured formula also reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 221502 (2023)]. A concurrent mechanism of the particle production due to the axial anomaly is briefly discussed and critical remarks on the state-dependence are also given.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>
