      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Minimizing the Kirchhoff Index via Adding Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirchhoff index, which is the sum of the resistance distance between every pair of nodes in a network, is a key metric for gauging network performance, where lower values signify enhanced performance. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the Kirchhoff index by adding edges. We first provide a greedy algorithm for solving this problem and give an analysis of its quality based on the bounds of the submodularity ratio and the curvature. Then, we introduce a gradient-based greedy algorithm as a new paradigm to solve this problem. To accelerate the computation cost, we leverage geometric properties, convex hull approximation, and approximation of the projected coordinate of each point. To further improve this algorithm, we use pre-pruning and fast update techniques, making it particularly suitable for large networks. Our proposed algorithms have nearly-linear time complexity. We provide extensive experiments on ten real networks to evaluate the quality of our algorithms. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our algorithms are scalable to large graphs with over 5 million nodes and 12 million edges.</description>

      <title>On Supports for graphs of bounded genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{E})$ be a hypergraph. A support is a graph $Q$ on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the subgraph of $Q$ induced on the elements in $E$ is connected. We consider the problem of constructing a support for hypergraphs defined by connected subgraphs of a host graph. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of connected subgraphs of $G$. Let the vertices of $G$ be partitioned into two sets the \emph{terminals} $\mathbf{b}(V)$ and the \emph{non-terminals} $\mathbf{r}(V)$. We define a hypergraph on $\mathbf{b}(V)$, where each $H\in\mathcal{H}$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the vertices of $\mathbf{b}(V)$ in $H$.
  We also consider the problem of constructing a support for the \emph{dual hypergraph} - a hypergraph on $\mathcal{H}$ where each $v\in \mathbf{b}(V)$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $v$. In fact, we construct supports for a common generalization of the primal and dual settings called the \emph{intersection hypergraph}.
  As our main result, we show that if the host graph $G$ has bounded genus and the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ satisfy a condition of being \emph{cross-free}, then there exists a support that also has bounded genus. Our results are a generalization of the results of Raman and Ray (Rajiv Raman, Saurabh Ray: Constructing Planar Support for Non-Piercing Regions. Discret. Comput. Geom. 64(3): 1098-1122 (2020)).
  Our techniques imply a unified analysis for packing and covering problems for hypergraphs defined on surfaces of bounded genus. We also describe applications of our results for hypergraph colorings.</description>

      <title>On the Maiorana-McFarland Class Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The closure $\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}$ and the extension $\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{m}$ of the Maiorana--McFarland class $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ in $m = 2n$ variables relative to the extended-affine equivalence and the bent function construction $f \oplus \mathrm{Ind}_{U}$ are considered, where $U$ is an affine subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{m}$ of dimension $m/2$. We obtain an explicit formula for $|\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{m}|$ and an upper bound for $|\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{m}^{\#}|$. Asymptotically tight bounds for $|\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}|$ are proved as well, for instance, $|\mathcal{M}_{8}^{\#}| \approx 2^{77.865}$. Metric properties of $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}$ are also investigated. We find the number of all closest bent functions to the set $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ and provide an upper bound of the same number for $\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}$. The average number $E(\mathcal{M}_{m})$ of $m/2$-dimensional affine subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{m}$ such that a function from $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ is affine on each of them is calculated. We obtain that similarly defined $E(\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#})$ satisfies $E(\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}) &lt; E(\mathcal{M}_{m})$ and $E(\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}) = E(\mathcal{M}_{m}) - o(1)$.</description>

      <title>The Avoider-Enforcer game on hypergraphs of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Avoider-Enforcer convention of positional games, two players, Avoider and Enforcer, take turns selecting vertices from a hypergraph H. Enforcer wins if, by the time all vertices of H have been selected, Avoider has completely filled an edge of H with her vertices; otherwise, Avoider wins. In this paper, we first give some general results, in particular regarding the outcome of the game and disjoint unions of hypergraphs. We then determine which player has a winning strategy for all hypergraphs of rank 2, and for linear hypergraphs of rank 3 when Avoider plays the last move. The structural characterisations we obtain yield polynomial-time algorithms.</description>

      <title>The commutativity problem for effective varieties of formal series, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formal series in noncommuting variables $\Sigma$ over the rationals is a mapping $\Sigma^* \to \mathbb Q$. We say that a series is commutative if the value in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input. The commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite presentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it is commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has not been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.
  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that constitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's varieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series, introduced by Sch\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective (pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.
  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of formal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata, shuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these models recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their commutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it remarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such disparate computation models.
  Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of formal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power series for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential equations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks to this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive sequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are effective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.</description>

      <title>Renaming in distributed certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local certification is the area of distributed network computing asking the following question: How to certify to the nodes of a network that a global property holds, if they are limited to a local verification?
  In this area, it is often essential to have identifiers, that is, unique integers assigned to the nodes. In this short paper, we show how to reduce the range of the identifiers, in three different settings. More precisely, we show how to rename identifiers in the classical local certification setting, when we can (resp.\ cannot) choose the new identifiers, and we show how a global certificate can help to encode very compactly a new identifier assignment that is not injective in general, but still useful in applications.
  We conclude with a number of applications of these results: For every $\ell$, there are local certification schemes for the properties of having clique number at most $\ell$, having diameter at most $\ell$, and having independence number at most~2, with certificates of size $O(n)$. We also show that there is a global certification scheme for bipartiteness with certificates of size $O(n)$. All these results are optimal.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>
