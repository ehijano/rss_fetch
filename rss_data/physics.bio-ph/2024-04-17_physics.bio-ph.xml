      <title>Energy Transfer Mechanism Under Incoherent Light Excitation in noisy Environments: Memory Effects in Efficiency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the energy gap and coupling constants in and between chromophores can play important role in the absorption and energy transfer across a collection of two level systems. In a noisy environment, fluctuations can control efficiency of energy transfer through several factors, including quantum coherence. Several recent studies have investigated the impact of light-induced stationary quantum coherence on the efficiency of transferring optical excitation to a designated "trap" state, crucial for subsequent reactions such as those in photosynthesis. However, these studies have typically employed either a Markovian, or a perturbative approximation for the environment induced fluctuations. In this study, we depart from these approaches to incorporate memory effects by using Kubo's quantum stochastic Liouville equation (QSLE). We introduce the effects of the decay of excitation (to the ground state) and the desired trapping that provides the direction of the motion of the excitation. In the presence of light-induced pumping, we establish a relation between the mean survival time, efficiency, and the correlation decay time of the bath-induced fluctuations. We find a decrease in the steady state coherence during the transition from the non-Markovian regime (characterized by small values of fluctuation strength V and inverse of bath correlation time b) to the Markovian limit (where V and b are both large), resulting in a decrease in efficiency. We recover a connection between transfer flux and the imaginary part of coherences in both equilibrium and excited bath states, in both correlated and We uncover a non-monotonic dependence of efficiency on site energy heterogeneity for both correlated and uncorrelated bath models.</description>

      <title>Synchronous PIV measurements of a self-powered blood turbine and pump couple for right ventricle support</title>

Abstract: A blood turbine-pump system (iATVA), resembling a turbocharger was proposed as a mechanical right-heart assist device without external drive power. In this study, the iATVA system is investigated with particular emphasis on the blood turbine flow dynamics. A time-resolved 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV) set-up equipped with a beam splitter and two high speed cameras, allowed simultaneous recordings from both the turbine and pump impellers at 7 different phased-locked instances. The iATVA prototype is 3D printed using an optically clear resin following our earlier PIV protocols. Results showed that magnetically coupled impellers operated synchronously. As the turbine flow rate increased from 1.6 to 2.4 LPM, the rotational speed and relative inlet flow angle increase from 630 to 900 rpm, and 38 to 55% respectively. At the trailing edges, backflow region spanned 3/5 of the total passage outlet flow, and an extra leakage flow was observed at the leading edge. For this initial turbine design, approximately, 75% of the turbine blade passage was not contributing to the impulse operation mode. The maximum non-wall shear rate was ~2288 s-1 near to the inlet exit, which is significantly lower than the commercial blood pumps, encouraging further research and blood experiments of this novel concept. Experimental results will improve the hydrodynamic design of the turbine impeller and volute regions and will be useful in computational fluid dynamics validation studies of similar passive devices.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusion is temperature independent on active membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular transport maintains cellular structures and functions. For example, lipid and protein diffusion sculpts the dynamic shapes and structures on the cell membrane that perform essential cellular functions, such as cell signaling. Temperature variations in thermal equilibrium rapidly change molecular transport properties. The coefficient of lipid self-diffusion increases exponentially with temperature in thermal equilibrium, for example. Hence, in the noisy cellular environment, where temperatures can fluctuate widely due to local heat generation, maintaining cellular homeostasis through molecular transport is hard in thermal equilibrium. In this paper, using both molecular and lattice-based modeling of membrane transport, we show that the presence of active transport originating from the cell's cytoskeleton can make the self-diffusion of the molecules on the membrane robust to temperature fluctuations. The resultant temperature-independence of self-diffusion keeps the precision of cellular signaling invariant over a broad range of ambient temperatures, allowing cells to make robust decisions. We have also found that the Kawasaki algorithm, the widely used model of lipid transport on lattices, predicts incorrect temperature dependence of lipid self-diffusion in equilibrium. We propose a new algorithm that correctly captures the equilibrium properties of lipid self-diffusion and reproduces experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating landscapes and heavy tails in animal behavior</title>

Abstract: Animal behavior is shaped by a myriad of mechanisms acting on a wide range of scales, which hampers quantitative reasoning and the identification of general principles. Here, we combine data analysis and theory to investigate the relationship between behavioral plasticity and heavy-tailed statistics often observed in animal behavior. Specifically, we first leverage high-resolution recordings of C. elegans locomotion to show that stochastic transitions among long-lived behaviors exhibit heavy-tailed first passage time distributions and correlation functions. Such heavy tails can be explained by slow adaptation of behavior over time. This particular result motivates our second step of introducing a general model where we separate fast dynamics on a quasi-stationary multi-well potential, from non-ergodic, slowly varying modes. We then show that heavy tails generically emerge in such a model, and we provide a theoretical derivation of the resulting functional form, which can become a power law with exponents that depend on the strength of the fluctuations. Finally, we provide direct support for the generality of our findings by testing them in a C. elegans mutant where adaptation is suppressed and heavy tails thus disappear, and recordings of larval zebrafish swimming behavior where heavy tails are again prevalent.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the overall runtime of our method has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. The numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry by leveraging perturbation theory.</description>
