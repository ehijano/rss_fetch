      <title>Zero-shot Voice Conversion with Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion aims to transform a source speech utterance to match the timbre of a reference speech from an unseen speaker. Traditional approaches struggle with timbre leakage, insufficient timbre representation, and mismatches between training and inference tasks. We propose Seed-VC, a novel framework that addresses these issues by introducing an external timbre shifter during training to perturb the source speech timbre, mitigating leakage and aligning training with inference. Additionally, we employ a diffusion transformer that leverages the entire reference speech context, capturing fine-grained timbre features through in-context learning. Experiments demonstrate that Seed-VC outperforms strong baselines like OpenVoice and CosyVoice, achieving higher speaker similarity and lower word error rates in zero-shot voice conversion tasks. We further extend our approach to zero-shot singing voice conversion by incorporating fundamental frequency (F0) conditioning, resulting in comparative performance to current state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of Seed-VC in overcoming core challenges, paving the way for more accurate and versatile voice conversion systems.</description>

      <title>XLSR-Mamba: A Dual-Column Bidirectional State Space Model for Spoofing Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers and their variants have achieved great success in speech processing. However, their multi-head self-attention mechanism is computationally expensive. Therefore, one novel selective state space model, Mamba, has been proposed as an alternative. Building on its success in automatic speech recognition, we apply Mamba for spoofing attack detection. Mamba is well-suited for this task as it can capture the artifacts in spoofed speech signals by handling long-length sequences. However, Mamba's performance may suffer when it is trained with limited labeled data. To mitigate this, we propose combining a new structure of Mamba based on a dual-column architecture with self-supervised learning, using the pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model. The experiments show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and faster inference on the ASVspoof 2021 LA and DF datasets, and on the more challenging In-the-Wild dataset, it emerges as the strongest candidate for spoofing attack detection. The code will be publicly released in due course.</description>

      <title>EveGuard: Defeating Vibration-based Side-Channel Eavesdropping with Audio Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrometry-based side channels pose a significant privacy risk, exploiting sensors like mmWave radars, light sensors, and accelerometers to detect vibrations from sound sources or proximate objects, enabling speech eavesdropping. Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.</description>

      <title>TraceableSpeech: Towards Proactively Traceable Text-to-Speech with Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various threats posed by the progress in text-to-speech (TTS) have prompted the need to reliably trace synthesized speech. However, contemporary approaches to this task involve adding watermarks to the audio separately after generation, a process that hurts both speech quality and watermark imperceptibility. In addition, these approaches are limited in robustness and flexibility. To address these problems, we propose TraceableSpeech, a novel TTS model that directly generates watermarked speech, improving watermark imperceptibility and speech quality. Furthermore, We design the frame-wise imprinting and extraction of watermarks, achieving higher robustness against resplicing attacks and temporal flexibility in operation. Experimental results show that TraceableSpeech outperforms the strong baseline where VALL-E or HiFicodec individually uses WavMark in watermark imperceptibility, speech quality and resilience against resplicing attacks. It also can apply to speech of various durations. The code is avaliable at https://github.com/zjzser/TraceableSpeech</description>

      <title>SaMoye: Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion Model Based on Feature Disentanglement and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07728v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice to another singer's from a reference audio while keeping the original semantics. However, existing SVC methods can hardly perform zero-shot due to incomplete feature disentanglement or dependence on the speaker look-up table. We propose the first open-source high-quality zero-shot SVC model SaMoye that can convert singing to human and non-human timbre. SaMoye disentangles the singing voice's features into content, timbre, and pitch features, where we combine multiple ASR models and compress the content features to reduce timbre leaks. Besides, we enhance the timbre features by unfreezing the speaker encoder and mixing the speaker embedding with top-3 similar speakers. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance, which comprises more than 1,815 hours of pure singing voice and 6,367 speakers. We conduct objective and subjective experiments to find that SaMoye outperforms other models in zero-shot SVC tasks even under extreme conditions like converting singing to animals' timbre. The code and weight of SaMoye are available on https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC. The weights, code, dataset, and documents of SaMoye are publicly available on \url{https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC}.</description>

      <title>A Low-rank Matching Attention based Cross-modal Feature Fusion Method for Conversational Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational emotion recognition (CER) is an important research topic in human-computer interactions. {Although recent advancements in transformer-based cross-modal fusion methods have shown promise in CER tasks, they tend to overlook the crucial intra-modal and inter-modal emotional interaction or suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we introduce a novel and lightweight cross-modal feature fusion method called Low-Rank Matching Attention Method (LMAM). LMAM effectively captures contextual emotional semantic information in conversations while mitigating the quadratic complexity issue caused by the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, by setting a matching weight and calculating inter-modal features attention scores row by row, LMAM requires only one-third of the parameters of self-attention methods. We also employ the low-rank decomposition method on the weights to further reduce the number of parameters in LMAM. As a result, LMAM offers a lightweight model while avoiding overfitting problems caused by a large number of parameters. Moreover, LMAM is able to fully exploit the intra-modal emotional contextual information within each modality and integrates complementary emotional semantic information across modalities by computing and fusing similarities of intra-modal and inter-modal features simultaneously. Experimental results verify the superiority of LMAM compared with other popular cross-modal fusion methods on the premise of being more lightweight. Also, LMAM can be embedded into any existing state-of-the-art CER methods in a plug-and-play manner, and can be applied to other multi-modal recognition tasks, e.g., session recommendation and humour detection, demonstrating its remarkable generalization ability.</description>

      <title>REBORN: Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to learn the mapping between the speech signal and its corresponding textual transcription without the supervision of paired speech-text data. A word/phoneme in the speech signal is represented by a segment of speech signal with variable length and unknown boundary, and this segmental structure makes learning the mapping between speech and text challenging, especially without paired data. In this paper, we propose REBORN,Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR. REBORN alternates between (1) training a segmentation model that predicts the boundaries of the segmental structures in speech signals and (2) training the phoneme prediction model, whose input is the speech feature segmented by the segmentation model, to predict a phoneme transcription. Since supervised data for training the segmentation model is not available, we use reinforcement learning to train the segmentation model to favor segmentations that yield phoneme sequence predictions with a lower perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments and find that under the same setting, REBORN outperforms all prior unsupervised ASR models on LibriSpeech, TIMIT, and five non-English languages in Multilingual LibriSpeech. We comprehensively analyze why the boundaries learned by REBORN improve the unsupervised ASR performance.</description>

      <title>A Simple but Strong Baseline for Sounding Video Generation: Effective Adaptation of Audio and Video Diffusion Models for Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we build a simple but strong baseline for sounding video generation. Given base diffusion models for audio and video, we integrate them with additional modules into a single model and train it to make the model jointly generate audio and video. To enhance alignment between audio-video pairs, we introduce two novel mechanisms in our model. The first one is timestep adjustment, which provides different timestep information to each base model. It is designed to align how samples are generated along with timesteps across modalities. The second one is a new design of the additional modules, termed Cross-Modal Conditioning as Positional Encoding (CMC-PE). In CMC-PE, cross-modal information is embedded as if it represents temporal position information, and the embeddings are fed into the model like positional encoding. Compared with the popular cross-attention mechanism, CMC-PE provides a better inductive bias for temporal alignment in the generated data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the two newly introduced mechanisms and also demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Synthetic Command Attacks on Smart Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in voice synthesis, coupled with the ease with which speech can be harvested for millions of people, introduce new threats to applications that are enabled by devices such as voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home etc.). We explore if unrelated and limited amount of speech from a target can be used to synthesize commands for a voice assistant like Amazon Alexa. More specifically, we investigate attacks on voice assistants with synthetic commands when they match command sources to authorized users, and applications (e.g., Alexa Skills) process commands only when their source is an authorized user with a chosen confidence level. We demonstrate that even simple concatenative speech synthesis can be used by an attacker to command voice assistants to perform sensitive operations. We also show that such attacks, when launched by exploiting compromised devices in the vicinity of voice assistants, can have relatively small host and network footprint. Our results demonstrate the need for better defenses against synthetic malicious commands that could target voice assistants.</description>
