      <title>Evolution of an Alfv\'en Wave-Driven Proton Beam in the Expanding Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the self-consistent formation and long-term evolution of proton beams in the expanding solar wind using an ensemble of one-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulations. Initial conditions are chosen to represent a range of plasma states observed by the Helios spacecraft at 0.3 AU, including an amplitude-modulated Alfv\'en wave that nonlinearly drives a proton beam aligned with the magnetic field. We compare simulation results with solar wind data out to 1.5 AU and show that our model reproduces key observed features of proton beams on average, such as the radial evolution of the drift and the relative core-to-beam density ratio. These findings support the theory that the observed evolution of the proton beam drift in the solar wind is determined by kinetic instabilities. More broadly, our results indicate that the interplay between nonlinear Alfv\'en wave dynamics, expansion effects and kinetic instabilities plays a fundamental role in solar wind dynamics, with implications for interpreting solar wind heating rate estimates.</description>

      <title>Rebound Suppression Mechanisms of Particle-Filled Flexible Shells for Small Body Landings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremely weak gravity on small bodies makes landers prone to rebound and uncontrolled drift. To mitigate this, the Hayabusa2 mission employed a particle-filled flexible shell, but the coupled dynamics of shell deformation and internal particle dissipation remain unclear. We develop a computational model representing the flexible shell as a spring-mass network and fully resolve particle collisions, friction, and interactions with granular beds. Results show the flexible shell-granule system dissipates over 90 percent of impact energy, far exceeding rigid shells. Energy loss arises from shell-particle coupling, with the particle filling ratio dominating. Impacts on rigid planes produce large shell deformation, while granular beds limit deformation. Scaling and velocity analyses reveal distinct dissipation regimes. These findings clarify energy transfer mechanisms and inform the design of microgravity impact mitigation devices.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Shock Properties of the 2023 March 13 Event from In-Situ and Remote-Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most powerful accelerators of gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the inner heliosphere. On 2023 March 13, a halo CME, as seen from the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Sun TErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), gave rise to a strong SEP event. In this work, we aim to analyze this CME-driven shock from multiple spacecraft, using both remote sensing observations from STEREO-A/COR2 and in-situ data from Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind. In order to determine its direction of propagation and kinematic properties, we model the shock geometry using STEREO-A/COR2 and SoHO/LASCO/C3 observations as an expanding ellipsoid. The density compression ratio of the shock is determined by fitting the brightness profile from the coronagraphic images with that obtained from raytracing simulations of a double-Gaussian shock density profile. We compare physical quantities such as compression ratio and Alfv\'enic Mach number derived from remote sensing observations with in-situ measurements by PSP, SolO, STEREO-A, and Wind. From STEREO-A/COR2, we determine the compression ratio around the entire shock front in the corona, finding significant non-homogeneities that can impact the values found during in-situ crossings. Following the evolution of the parameters characterizing the CME from the source to space, we find that closer to the Sun, both the gas compression ratio and the Alfv\'enic Mach number remain almost constant, while they increase at larger radial distances. This indicates a non-trivial evolution of the shock parameters during its journey through the interplanetary space.</description>
