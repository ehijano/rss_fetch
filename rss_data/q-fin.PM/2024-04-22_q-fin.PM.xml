      <title>Continuous-time Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning via Quadratic Variation Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies continuous-time risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation with the exponential-form objective. The risk-sensitive objective arises either as the agent's risk attitude or as a distributionally robust approach against the model uncertainty. Owing to the martingale perspective in Jia and Zhou (2023) the risk-sensitive RL problem is shown to be equivalent to ensuring the martingale property of a process involving both the value function and the q-function, augmented by an additional penalty term: the quadratic variation of the value process, capturing the variability of the value-to-go along the trajectory. This characterization allows for the straightforward adaptation of existing RL algorithms developed for non-risk-sensitive scenarios to incorporate risk sensitivity by adding the realized variance of the value process. Additionally, I highlight that the conventional policy gradient representation is inadequate for risk-sensitive problems due to the nonlinear nature of quadratic variation; however, q-learning offers a solution and extends to infinite horizon settings. Finally, I prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm for Merton's investment problem and quantify the impact of temperature parameter on the behavior of the learning procedure. I also conduct simulation experiments to demonstrate how risk-sensitive RL improves the finite-sample performance in the linear-quadratic control problem.</description>

      <title>Risk valuation of quanto derivatives on temperature and electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a coupled model for day-ahead electricity prices and average daily temperature which allows to model quanto weather and energy derivatives. These products have gained on popularity as they enable to hedge against both volumetric and price risks. Electricity day-ahead prices and average daily temperatures are modelled through non homogeneous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by a Brownian motion and a Normal Inverse Gaussian L\'evy process, which allows to include dependence between them. A Conditional Least Square method is developed to estimate the different parameters of the model and used on real data. Then, explicit and semi-explicit formulas are obtained for derivatives including quanto options and compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Last, we develop explicit formulas to hedge statically single and double sided quanto options by a portfolio of electricity options and temperature options (CDD or HDD).</description>
