      <title>Simulation of Rutherford Cable AC Loss and Magnetization with the Coupled Axial and Transverse Currents Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled axial and transverse currents (CATI) method was recently introduced to model the AC loss and magnetization in twisted composite superconducting strands with low computational cost and high accuracy. This method involves two-dimensional finite element (FE) models coupled with circuit equations representing the periodicity of the strand. In this paper, we propose to adapt the CATI method to Rutherford cables, which are periodic structures made of transposed superconducting strands. We focus on reproducing the interstrand coupling currents flowing across contact resistances between the strands and we analyze the associated AC loss. We show that results of a reference three-dimensional FE model are accurately reproduced with a strongly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the blowout plasma wakefields produced by drive beams with elliptical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the underdense (blowout) regime of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the particle beam is denser than the plasma. Under these conditions, the plasma electrons are nearly completely rarefacted from the beam channel, resulting in a nominally uniform ion column. Extensive investigations of this interaction assuming axisymmetry have been undertaken. However, the plasma blowout produced by a transversely asymmetric driver possesses quite different characteristics. They create an asymmetric plasma rarefaction region (bubble) which leads to asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. This is also accompanied by an undesired non-uniform accelerating gradient. The asymmetric blowout cross-section is found through simulation to be elliptical, and treating it as such permits a simple extension of the symmetric theory. In particular, focusing fields linear in both transverse directions exist in the bubble. The form of the wake potential and the concomitant matching conditions in this elliptical cavity are discussed in this paper. We also discuss bubble boundary estimation in the long driver limit and applications of the asymmetric features of the wakefield.</description>
