      <title>Macroscopic magnetization of primordial plasma by virial shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy-cluster virial (structure-formation accretion) shock observations are shown to imply $\gtrsim1\%$ magnetization of a layer extending $\gtrsim10^{16}$ Debye lengths downstream, challenging the modelling of high Alfv\'en-Mach collisionless shocks. Unlike similar shocks in supernova remnants or relativistic shocks in $\gamma$-ray burst afterglows, where macroscopic magnetized layers were detected but purportedly attributed to preexisting or non-resonant cosmic-ray streaming-seeded substructure, the upstream of strong virial shocks is both weakly magnetized and pristine. Hence, some mechanism must generate large-scale and possibly self-similar magnetic sub-structure out of the accreted primordial plasma; such a mechanism may dominate other high-Mach shock systems, too.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model of Cosmic Ray Propagation and Radio Extreme Scattering Events from Intermittent Interstellar Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittent magnetic structures are a plausible candidate for explaining cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion rates derived from observed CR energy spectra. Independently, studies of extreme scattering events (ESEs) of radio quasars and pulsar scintillation have hinted that very straight, large-aspect-ratio, magnetic current sheets may be responsible for the localized large scattering of radio waves. The required shortest axis of the typical structures producing ESEs is of the same scale ($\sim$AU) as the gyroradii of $\sim$GeV CRs. In this paper, we propose that the same magnetic/density sheets can produce large scattering of both CRs and radio waves. We demonstrate that the geometry and volume filling factor of the sheets derived from quasar ESEs can explain the observed mean free path of GeV CRs without introducing free parameters. The model places constraints on the sheet geometry, such as straightness and large aspect ratio, and assumes the statistics of the sheets are similar throughout the Galactic volume. We, therefore, discuss observational tests of the sheet model, which includes observations of echoes in pulsars and fast radio bursts, gravitationally lensed quasars, the distribution of ESE durations, and spatial correlations between ESE events and rotation-measure fluctuations. Such tests will be enabled by upcoming wide-field radio instruments, including Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and Deep Synoptic Array 2000 Antennas (DSA-2000).</description>

      <title>Weakness of X-rays and Variability in High-redshift AGNs with Super-Eddington Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity -- such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability -- remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with $\lesssim 10^{7-8}~M_\odot$, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.</description>

      <title>A deep Chandra study verifies diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission from the globular cluster Terzan 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse X-ray emission has been detected from a few Galactic globular clusters (GCs), whereas its nature still remains largely unclear. The GC Terzan 5 was previously found to show a significant diffuse thermal X-ray excess from its field, likely contributed by the Galactic background, and a non-thermal component described by a power-law model with photon index $\Gamma \sim 1$. With over 16 times the accumulated Chandra exposure time as in the prior study, we are motivated to reexamine and verify the diffuse X-ray emission from the field of Terzan 5, enabling constraints on its nature. We verify a significant diffuse X-ray excess from the field of Terzan 5 in the band 0.8--3 keV. After constraining the contribution from local X-ray background, we find a diffuse X-ray component that is genuinely associated with Terzan 5, which can be well described by a power-law model. More interestingly, the fitted photon indices show a significant increase from $\Gamma = 1.96 \pm 0.18$ in the inner region to $\Gamma = 3.48 \pm 0.71$ in the outer region. The diffuse X-rays can also be well fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung model, with plasma temperatures declining from $kT \sim 3$ keV to $kT \sim 1$ keV. We suggest that synchrotron radiation from the combined pulsar winds of Terzan 5's millisecond pulsar population is a possible origin of the observed diffuse X-ray emission, but the the large steepening in the spectra cannot be produced solely by synchrotron cooling. Other radiation processes, like thermal bremsstrahlung, may also contribute to the diffuse X-rays.</description>

      <title>Isolated neutron stars as Science Validation for XMM2ATHENA: Ensuring robust data for future X-ray Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of radio-quiet, X-ray thermally emitting isolated neutron stars (XINSs) in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey revealed a previously overlooked component of the neutron star population. Advancements in X-ray instrumentation and the availability of deep, wide-area optical surveys now enable us to explore XINSs at fainter X-ray fluxes and greater distances. In this study, we investigated candidates selected from the 4XMM-DR9 catalogue using XMM-Newton, focusing on long-term flux stability, spectral characterisation, and astrometry. By leveraging resources from the XMM2ATHENA project -- including updated catalogues, multiwavelength characterisation and machine learning classification -- we refined our understanding of this sample of soft X-ray emitters. Our findings enhance the characterisation of XINS candidates, laying the groundwork for more targeted investigations and future catalogue searches.</description>

      <title>Search for transient gamma-ray emission from magnetar flares using Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for transient gamma-ray emission in the energy range from 0.1-300 GeV using data from the Fermi-LAT telescope in coincidence with magnetar flares. For our analysis we look for coincidence with 15 distinct flares from 11 magnetars using two distinct time windows of $\pm$ 1 day and $\pm$ 15 days. For 14 of these flares from 10 magnetars, we do not see any statistically significant gamma-ray emission. However, we see two gamma-ray flares from one magnetar, namely 1E 1048.1-5937, with combined significance of $5\sigma$, observed after about 10 days from the peak of the X-ray flare. However, this magnetar is located close to the galactic plane (with galactic latitude of -0.52\degree) and this signal could be caused by contamination due to diffuse flux from gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.</description>

      <title>The puzzling long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 191019A was a long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting about 65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z=0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus re-analyzed unpublished GROND multi-color (g'r'i'z'JHK_s) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days post trigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days post-burst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of about 0.06 solar mass. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0=10^7-10^8 cm^-3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 = 1 cm^-3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength picture of the misaligned BL Lac object 3C 371</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BL Lac object 3C 371 is one of the targets that are regularly monitored by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration to study blazar variability on both short and long timescales. We aim to evaluate the long-term multiwavelength (MWL) behaviour of 3C 371, comparing it with the results derived for its optical emission in our previous study. For this, we make use of the multi-band campaigns organized by the WEBT Collaboration in optical and radio between January 2018 and December 2020, and of public data from Swift and Fermi satellites and the MOJAVE Very Large Interferometry programme. We evaluate the variability shown by the source in each band with the amplitude variability quantification, as well as possible interband correlation using the z-Discrete Correlation Function. We also present a deep analysis of the optical-UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectral variability. With the MOJAVE data we perform a kinematics analysis, looking for components propagating along the jet, calculating its kinematics parameters. This set of parameters is later used for the interpretation of the source MWL behaviour, modelling the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source with theoretical blazar emission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Radio pulsar population synthesis with consistent flux measurements using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the entire neutron star population can be inferred by modeling their evolution, from birth to the present, through pulsar population synthesis. This involves simulating a mock population, applying observational filters, and comparing the resulting sources to the limited subset of detected pulsars. We specifically focus on the magneto-rotational properties of Galactic isolated neutron stars and provide new insights into the intrinsic radio luminosity law by combining pulsar population synthesis with a simulation-based inference (SBI) technique called truncated sequential neural posterior estimation (TSNPE). We employ TSNPE to train a neural density estimator on simulated pulsar populations to approximate the posterior distribution of the underlying parameters. This technique efficiently explores the parameter space by concentrating on regions that are most likely to match the observed data thus allowing a significant reduction in training dataset size. We demonstrate the efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE), achieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with previous studies using only around 4% of the simulations required by NPE approaches. Moreover, for the first time, we incorporate data from the Thousand Pulsar Array (TPA) program on MeerKAT, the largest unified sample of neutron stars with consistent fluxes measurement to date, to help constrain the stars' intrinsic radio luminosity. We find that adding flux information as an input to the neural network largely improves the constraints on the pulsars' radio luminosity, as well as improving the estimates on other input parameters.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional velocity fields in the silicon- and sulfur-reach ejecta in the remnant of Tycho supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional velocity structure of the shock-heated Si-reach and S-reach ejecta were reconstructed in Tycho supernova remnant from Doppler-shifted lines. The vector components along the line of sight were restored from the spatially resolved spectral analysis of the Doppler shifts of Si XIII and S XV lines. The components in the plane of the sky were derived from analysis of the proper motion of the remnant's edge at different azimuths. This has been done by using the data of X-ray observations from Chandra observatory as well as the radio data from the Very Large Array.
  Differences in Doppler velocities over the Tycho's SNR are of the order of thousands of km/s. The speed of the ejecta on the opposite sides of the remnant as a three-dimensional object differs on 20-30%. There are asymmetries and differences in the spatial distributions between the Si-reach and S-reach ejecta components. Namely, the level of isotropy is higher in Si while the vector components directed outward of the observer are larger in S. This puts limitations on the level of deviation of the internal structure of the progenitor star from the ideal layered structure as well as on the level of asymmetries in supernova explosion.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Correlation of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts: Correlated Aftershocks Tend to Exhibit Downward Frequency Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains elusive, and potential correlations between burst occurrence times and various burst properties may offer important clues. Among them, the spectral peak frequency is particularly important because it may encode direct information about the physical conditions and environment at the emission site. Analyzing over 4,000 bursts from the three most active sources -- FRB 20121102A, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20220912A -- we measure the two-point correlation function $\xi(\Delta t, \Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ in the two-dimensional space of time separation $\Delta t$ and peak frequency shift $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ between burst pairs. We find a universal trend of asymmetry about $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ at high statistical significance; $\xi(\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ decreases as $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ increases from negative to positive values in the region of short time separation ($\Delta t &lt; 0.3$ s), where physically correlated aftershock events produce a strong time correlation signal. This indicates that aftershocks tend to exhibit systematically lower peak frequencies than mainshocks, with this tendency becoming stronger at shorter $\Delta t$. We argue that the "sad trombone effect" -- the downward frequency drift observed among sub-pulses within a single event -- is not confined within a single event but manifests as a statistical nature that extends continuously to independent yet physically correlated aftershocks with time separations up to $\Delta t \sim 0.3$ s. This discovery provides new insights into underlying physical processes of repeater FRBs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence the effective mass in the MM is not correlated with NS observables. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR bounds on radiatively decaying particles from M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and other putative feebly interacting particles (FIPs) with a mass of tens to several hundreds of keVs can be produced in stellar cores with a Lorentz boost factor $E_a/m_a\lesssim 10$. Thus, starburst galaxies such as M82 are efficient factories of slow axions. Their decay $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ would produce a large flux of X-ray photons, peaking around $100$ keV and spread around the galaxy by an angle that can be relatively large. We use observations of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission to show that the absence of these features can constrain $30-500$ keV axion masses into uncharted regions for axion-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. Our argument can be applied to other heavy FIPs and astrophysical sources that are hot enough to produce them, yet cold enough to avoid large boost factors which slow down the decay.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: hyperbolicity, causality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a first-order theory of dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame, which is similar to Eckart's frame except that the temperature is determined by fixing the trace of the stress-energy tensor. Our theory is hyperbolic and causal provided a single inequality holds. For low wave numbers, the expected damped modes in the shear, acoustic, and heat diffusion channels are recovered. Stability of global equilibria with respect to all wave numbers is also analyzed. The conditions for hyperbolicity, causality and stability are satisfied for a simple gas of hard spheres or disks.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations in Hybrid Stars with Slow Quark Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the radial oscillations of hybrid neutron stars, characterized by a composition of hadronic external layers and a quark matter core. Utilizing a density-dependent relativistic mean-field model that incorporates hyperons and baryons for describing hadronic matter, and a density-dependent quark model for quark matter, we analyze the ten lowest eigenfrequencies and their corresponding oscillation functions. Our focus lies on neutron stars with equations-of-state involving N, N + $\Delta$, N + H, and N + H + $\Delta$, featuring a phase transition to quark matter. Emphasizing the effects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface, we observe that the maximum mass is attained before the fundamental mode's frequency decreases for slow phase transitions. This observation implies the stability of stellar configurations with higher central densities than the maximum mass, called Slow Stable Hybrid Stars (SSHSs), even under small radial perturbations. The length of these SSHS branch depends upon the energy density jump between two phases and the stiffness of the quark EoS.</description>

      <title>Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.</description>

      <title>Modeling the astrosphere of LHS~1140</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic ray (CR) flux, as well as the hydrogen flux into the atmosphere of an exoplanet, can change the composition of the atmosphere. Here, we present the CR and hydrogen flux on top of the atmosphere. To do so, we have to study the 3D multifluid MHD structure of astrospheres. We discuss the shock structure of the stellar wind of LHS 1140 using four different models: HD and MHD single-fluid models, as well as multifluid models for both cases, including a neutral hydrogen flow from the interstellar medium. The CR flux in a multifluid model as well as the ionization rate in an exoplanetary atmosphere are also presented. The astrosphere is modeled using the 3D Cronos code, while the CR flux at LHS 1140 b is calculated using both a 1D and a 3D stochastic galactic CR modulation code. Finally, the atmospheric ionization and radiation dose is estimated using the AtRIS code. Results. It is shown that the 3D multifluid positions of the termination shock differ remarkably from those found in the 3D ideal-single fluid hydrodynamic case. CR fluxes computed using a 1D approach are completely different from those calculated using the 3D modulation code and show an essentially unmodulated spectrum at the exoplanet in question. Utilizing these spectra, ionization rates and radiation exposure within the atmosphere of LHS 1140 b are derived. The termination shock, astropause, and bow shock distances must be taken from the 3D multifluid MHD model to determine the CR fluxes correctly. Moreover, because of the tiny astrosphere, the exoplanet is submerged in the neutral hydrogen flow of the interstellar medium, which will influence the exoplanetary atmosphere. A 3D approach to Galactic\0 cosmic ray (GCR) modulation in astrospheres is also necessary to avoid unrealistic estimates of GCR intensities.</description>

      <title>A Spectrophotometric analysis and dust properties of classical nova V5584 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, optical observations of the nova V5584 Sgr are presented. These observations cover different phases including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II, and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, which are subsequently observed in complete emission. The presence of numerous Fe II lines and low ejecta velocity aligns with the Fe II type nova classification. From optical and NIR colors it is clear that this nova manifests dust formation in the ejecta. The dust temperature and mass were estimated from a spectral energy distribution (SED) fit to the JHK band magnitudes and the WISE data. Light curve analysis shows t$_2$ and t$_3$ values of $\sim$ 26 and $\sim$ 48 days, classifying the nova as moderately fast. The physical and chemical properties during early decline and later phases were evaluated using the photoionization code CLOUDY. The best-fit model parameters from two epochs of multiwavelength spectra are compatible with a hot white dwarf source with a roughly constant luminosity of $\sim$ (2.08 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times$ 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find an ejected mass of $\sim$ (1.59 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$. Abundance analysis indicates that the ejecta is significantly enriched relative to solar values, with O/H = 30.2, C/H = 10.8, He/H = 1.8, Mg/H = 1.68, Na/H = 1.55, and N/H = 45.5 in the early decline phase, and O/H = 4.5, Ne/H = 1.5, and N/H = 24.5 in the nebular phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

      <title>MLody -- Deep Learning Generated Polarized Synchrotron Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarized synchrotron emission is a fundamental process in high-energy astrophysics, particularly in the environments around black holes and pulsars. Accurate modeling of this emission requires precise computation of the emission, absorption, rotation, and conversion coefficients, which are critical for radiative transfer simulations. Traditionally, these coefficients are derived using fit functions based on precomputed ground truth values. However, these fit functions often lack accuracy, particularly in specific plasma conditions not well represented in the datasets used to generate them. In this work, we introduce ${\tt MLody}$, a deep neural network designed to compute polarized synchrotron coefficients with high accuracy across a wide range of plasma parameters. We demonstrate ${\tt MLody}$'s capabilities by integrating it with a radiative transfer code to generate synthetic polarized synchrotron images for an accreting black hole simulation. Our results reveal significant differences, up to a factor of two, in both linear and circular polarization compared to traditional methods. These differences could have important implications for parameter estimation in Event Horizon Telescope observations, suggesting that ${\tt MLody}$ could enhance the accuracy of future astrophysical analyses.</description>

      <title>Could the neutrino emission of TXS 0506+056 come from the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy neutrinos from the blazar TXS~0506+056 are usually thought to arise from the relativistic jet pointing to us. However, the composition of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or Poynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays and neutrinos are expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether the neutrino emission from TXS~0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic reconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino flare of TXS~0506+056 in the year of 2014-2015, a super-Eddington accretion is needed. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a steady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term steady neutrino flux from TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically arrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime of accretion. In the MAD scenario, due to a high magnetic field, a large dissipation radius is required to avoid the cooling of protons due to the synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Prediction of Black Hole X-ray Spectra and Spectral Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data derived from general relativistic MHD simulations of accretion onto black holes can be used as input to a post-processing scheme that predicts the radiated spectrum. Combining a relativistic Compton-scattering radiation transfer solution in the corona with detailed local atmosphere solutions incorporating local ionization and thermal balance within the disk photosphere, it is possible to study both spectral formation and intrinsic spectral variability in the radiation from relativistic accretion disks. With this method, we find that radiatively-efficient systems with black holes of $10M_\odot$ accreting at $\approx 0.01$ in Eddington units produce spectra very similar to those observed in the hard states of X-ray binaries. The spectral shape above 10keV is well-described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff. Intrinsic turbulent variations lead to order-unity fluctuations in bolometric luminosity, logarithmic spectral slope fluctuations over a range $\approx 0.15$, and factor of 2 changes in the cut-off energy on timescales $\sim 50\, (M_{\rm BH}/10 M_\odot)$ms. Within the corona, the range of gas temperature spans more than an order of magnitude. The wide distribution of temperatures is central to defining the spectrum: the logarithmic spectral slope is harder by $\sim 0.3$ and the cut-off energy larger by a factor $\sim 10 - 30$ than if the coronal temperature everywhere were its mass-weighted mean.</description>

      <title>Commensal Transient Searches with MeerKAT in Gamma-Ray Burst and Supernova Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity and field of view of the MeerKAT radio telescope provides excellent opportunities for commensal transient searches. We carry out a commensal transient search in supernova and short gamma-ray burst fields using methodologies established in Chastain et al. (2023). We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanation for the variability. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking constraints in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $l$. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of $-0.185022 \leq l \leq 0.060938$. Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), the $l$ parameter is further constrained to $-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \leq l \leq 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}$, which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameter $l$, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds for $l$ derived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield $-0.0700225 \leq l \leq 0.189785$ using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the $l \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extended Inert Doublet Model: A First-Order Phase Transition Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended inert doublet model and obtained the parameter space allowing strong first order phase transitions. We show that a large part of the parameter space can cause double first-order phase transitions. Whereas both of these phase transitions can generate a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, one of them can create primordial black holes with appreciable abundance. The primordial black holes generated at the high scale transition can account for the dark matter maintaining the correct relic abundance. We also show specific benchmark cases and their consequences from the aspect of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Detecting eclipsing double white dwarfs with electromagnetic and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs are predominant sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies accessible to space-borne gravitational wave detectors. With advances in multi-messenger astronomy, an increasing number of double white dwarf systems will be discovered through both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we simulated two populations of double white dwarfs originating from different star formation histories (hereafter referred to as Model 1 and Model 2) using the binary population synthesis method. We predicted the number of double white dwarfs in our Galaxy detectable by TianQin and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) individually, as well as through their joint observation. In addition, we performed an analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation using the Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, we predicted the number of detached eclipsing double white dwarfs detectable by Gaia and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO). Our study found that over the nominal mission durations, TianQin, LISA, and their joint observation can detect at least five thousand and potentially several tens of thousands of double white dwarfs with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7. Gaia and VRO are expected to detect at least several dozen and up to several hundred eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital periods less than 30 hours. We also found that several dozen eclipsing double white dwarfs can be detected jointly through electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Evolving massive stars to core collapse with GENEC: Extension of equation of state, opacities and effective nuclear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 solar masses will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron captures, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgrade the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it may cover the regime of high temperatures and high densities required to produce progenitors of core-collapse. We have improved GENEC in three directions, equation of state, the nuclear reaction network and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 15, 20 and 25 solar masses at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies impacting explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with potential for further dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Modeling High Mass X-ray Binaries to Double Neutron Stars through Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present detailed evolutionary simulations of wide binary systems with high-mass ($8-20\,M_{\odot}$) donor stars and a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star. Mass transfer in such binaries is dynamically unstable and common envelope (CE) evolution is followed. We use a recently developed prescription to deal with CE evolution and consider various CE ejection efficiencies varying in the range of $0.1-3.0$. We focus on the evolutionary consequences of the binaries survived CE evolution. We demonstrate that it is possible for the binaries to enter a CE decoupling phase (CEDP) when the donor stars are partially stripped leaving a hydrogen envelope of $\lesssim1.0-4.0\,M_\odot$ after CE evolution. This phase is expected to last $\sim 10^4-10^5\,\rm yr$, during which mass transfer occurs stably via Roche lobe overflow with super-Eddington rates. Identification of some X-ray binaries in a CEDP is important for the understanding of the physics of CE evolution itself, the origin of ultraluminous X-ray sources, and the recycling process of accreting pulsars. Also, we discuss the formation of double neutron stars and the occurrence of ultra-stripped supernovae according to the results from our simulations. On the whole, the properties of post-CE binaries are sensitive to the options of CE ejection efficiencies.</description>
