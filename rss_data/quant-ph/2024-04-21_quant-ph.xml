      <title>Effective light-induced Hamiltonian for atoms with large nuclear spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-cold fermionic atoms, having two valence electrons, exhibit a distinctive internal state structure, wherein the nuclear spin becomes decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground electronic state. Consequently, the nuclear spin states are well isolated from the environment, rendering these atomic systems an opportune platform for quantum computation and quantum simulations. Coupling with off-resonance light is an essential tool to selectively and coherently manipulate the nuclear spin states. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin states of ultra-cold fermionic atoms due to such an off-resonance light. We obtain compact expressions for the scalar, vector and tensor light shifts taking into account both linear and quadratic contributions to the hyperfine splitting. The analysis has been carried out using the Green operator approach and solving the corresponding Dyson equation. Finally, we analyze different scenarios of light configurations which lead to the vector- and tensor-light shifts, as well as the pure spin-orbit coupling for the nuclear spin.</description>

      <title>Towards Application-Aware Quantum Circuit Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has made tremendous improvements in both software and hardware that have sparked interest in academia and industry to realize quantum computing applications. To this end, several steps are necessary: The underlying problem must be encoded in a quantum circuit, a suitable device must be selected to execute it, and it must be compiled accordingly. This compilation step has a significant influence on the quality of the resulting solution. However, current state-of-the-art compilation tools treat the quantum circuit as a sequence of instructions without considering the actual application it realizes -- wasting a yet untapped potential to increase the solution quality. In this work, a different approach is explored that explicitly incorporates the application considered and aims to optimize its solution quality during compilation. Initial results show the benefits of this approach: For an industry-inspired application of a quantum generative model, the proposed approach outperformed Qiskit's most-optimized compilation scheme and led to better solution quality. Therefore, this work presents a first step towards application-aware compilation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Supersymmetry: Interchangeability Between Jaynes-Cummings and Anti-Jaynes-Cummings Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersymmetric connection that exists between the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) and anti-Jaynes Cummings (AJC) models in quantum optics is unraveled entirely. A new method is proposed to obtain the temporal evolution of observables in the AJC model using supersymmetric techniques, providing an overview of its dynamics and extending the calculation to full photon counting statistics. The approach is general and can be applied to determine the high-order cumulants given an initial state. The analysis reveals that engineering the collapse-revival behavior and the quantum properties of the interacting field is possible by controlling the initial state of the atomic subsystem and the corresponding atomic frequency in the AJC model. The substantial potential for applications of supersymmetric techniques in the context of photonic quantum technologies is thus demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a leading modality for magnetic sensing and imaging under ambient conditions. However, these sensors suffer from degraded performance due to paramagnetic impurities and regions of stress in the diamond crystal lattice. This work demonstrates a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) for simultaneous mapping and spatial correlation of key properties of a millimeter-scale NV-diamond sensor chip, including: NV ensemble photoluminescence (PL) amplitude, spin-lattice relaxation time (T$_1$), and homogeneous and inhomogeneous spin coherence lifetimes (T$_2$ and T$_2^*$), as well as lattice stress/strain, birefringence magnitude, and birefringence angle of the diamond crystal.</description>

      <title>Increasing Interference Detection in Quantum Cryptography using the Quantum Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum message encryption protocols promise a secure way to distribute information while detecting eavesdropping. However, current protocols may suffer from significantly reduced eavesdropping protection when only a subset of qubits are observed by an attacker. In this paper, we present two quantum cryptographic protocols leveraging the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and show their higher effectiveness even when an attacker measures only a subset of the transmitted qubits. The foremost of these protocols is a novel QKD method that leverages this effectiveness of the QFT while being more practical than previously proposed QFT-based protocols, most notably by not relying on quantum memory. We additionally show how existing quantum encryption methods can be augmented with a QFT-based approach to improve eavesdropping detection. Finally, we provide equations to analyze different QFT-based detection schemes within these protocols so that protocol designers can make custom schemes for their purpose.</description>

      <title>Scalable spin squeezing from critical slowing down in short-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range spin-spin interactions are known to generate non-equilibrium dynamics which can squeeze the collective spin of a quantum spin ensemble in a scalable manner, leading to states whose metrologically useful entanglement grows with system size. Here we show theoretically that scalable squeezing can be produced in 2d U(1)-symmetric systems even by short-range interactions, i.e. interactions that at equilibrium do not lead to long-range order at finite temperatures, but rather to an extended, Berezhinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical phase. If the initial state is a coherent spin state in the easy plane of interactions, whose energy corresponds to a thermal state in the critical BKT phase, the non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits critical slowing down, corresponding to a power-law decay of the collective magnetization in time. This slow decay protects scalable squeezing, whose scaling reveals in turn the decay exponent of the magnetization. Our results open the path to realizing massive entangled states of potential metrological interest in many relevant platforms of quantum simulation and information processing -- such as Mott insulators of ultracold atoms, or superconducting circuits -- characterized by short-range interactions in planar geometries.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Coherent Errors using Matrix-Element Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repeating a gate sequence multiple times amplifies systematic errors coherently, making it a useful tool for characterizing quantum gates. However, the precision of such an approach is limited by low-frequency noises, while its efficiency hindered by time-consuming scans required to match up the phases of the off-diagonal matrix elements being amplified. Here, we overcome both challenges by interleaving the gate of interest with dynamical decoupling sequences in a protocol we call Matrix-Element Amplification using Dynamical Decoupling (MEADD). Using frequency-tunable superconducting qubits from a Google Sycamore quantum processor, we experimentally demonstrate that MEADD surpasses the accuracy and precision of existing characterization protocols for estimating systematic errors in single- and two-qubit gates. In particular, MEADD yields factors of 5 to 10 improvements in estimating coherent parameters of the $\mathrm{CZ}$ gates compared to existing methods, reaching a precision below one milliradian. We also use it to characterize coherent crosstalk in the processor which was previously too small to detect reliably.</description>

      <title>Classical-Quantum Dual Encoding for Laser Communications in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In typical laser communications classical information is encoded by modulating the amplitude of the laser beam and measured via direct detection. We add a layer of security using quantum physics to this standard scheme, applicable to free-space channels. We consider a simultaneous classical-quantum communication scheme where the classical information is encoded in the usual way and the quantum information is encoded as fluctuations of a sub-Poissonian noise-floor. For secret key generation, we consider a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol (CVQKD) using a Gaussian ensemble of squeezed states and direct detection. Under the assumption of passive attacks secure key generation and classical communication can proceed simultaneously. Compared with standard CVQKD. which is secure against unrestricted attacks, our added layer of quantum security is simple to implement, robust and does not affect classical data rates. We perform detailed simulations of the performance of the protocol for a free-space atmospheric channel. We analyse security of the CVQKD protocol in the composable finite-size regime.</description>

      <title>Qwerty: A Basis-Oriented Quantum Programming Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have evolved from the theoretical realm into a race to large-scale implementations. This is due to the promise of revolutionary speedups, where achieving such speedup requires designing an algorithm that harnesses the structure of a problem using quantum mechanics. Yet many quantum programming languages today require programmers to reason at a low level of quantum gate circuitry. This presents a significant barrier to entry for programmers who have not yet built up an intuition about quantum gate semantics, and it can prove to be tedious even for those who have. In this paper, we present Qwerty, a new quantum programming language that allows programmers to manipulate qubits more expressively than gates, relegating the tedious task of gate selection to the compiler. Due to its novel basis type and easy interoperability with Python, Qwerty is a powerful framework for high-level quantum-classical computation.</description>

      <title>Simple constructions of linear-depth t-designs and pseudorandom unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniformly random unitaries, i.e. unitaries drawn from the Haar measure, have many useful properties, but cannot be implemented efficiently. This has motivated a long line of research into random unitaries that "look" sufficiently Haar random while also being efficient to implement. Two different notions of derandomisation have emerged: $t$-designs are random unitaries that information-theoretically reproduce the first $t$ moments of the Haar measure, and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) are random unitaries that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar random.
  In this work, we take a unified approach to constructing $t$-designs and PRUs. For this, we introduce and analyse the "$PFC$ ensemble", the product of a random computational basis permutation $P$, a random binary phase operator $F$, and a random Clifford unitary $C$. We show that this ensemble reproduces exponentially high moments of the Haar measure. We can then derandomise the $PFC$ ensemble to show the following:
  (1) Linear-depth $t$-designs. We give the first construction of a (diamond-error) approximate $t$-design with circuit depth linear in $t$. This follows from the $PFC$ ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their $2t$-wise independent counterparts.
  (2) Non-adaptive PRUs. We give the first construction of PRUs with non-adaptive security, i.e. we construct unitaries that are indistinguishable from Haar random to polynomial-time distinguishers that query the unitary in parallel on an arbitary state. This follows from the $PFC$ ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their pseudorandom counterparts.
  (3) Adaptive pseudorandom isometries. We show that if one considers isometries (rather than unitaries) from $n$ to $n + \omega(\log n)$ qubits, a small modification of our PRU construction achieves general adaptive security.</description>

      <title>Qubit-assisted quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum metrology protocol based on a two-step joint evolution of the probe system and an ancillary qubit and a single-shot projective measurement. With an optimized initialization of the ancillary qubit, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) about the phase parameter encoded in the probe system is found to be determined by the expectation value of the square of a time-optimized phase generator, independent of the probe state. Therefore, QFI can approach the Heisenberg scaling $N^2$ with respect to the quantum number $N$, even when the probe system is prepared in a classical state. We find that this scaling behavior is robust against the imperfections in preparing the ancillary qubit and controlling the evolution time. Using the time-reversal strategy, the classical Fisher information (CFI) in our metrology protocol is saturated with its quantum counterpart. Our work thus paves an economical way to realize the Heisenberg-scaling limit in metrology precision with no use of entanglement or squeezing.</description>

      <title>Erasure-tolerance protocol for the surface codes on Rydberg atomic quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array with optical tweezers is a promising candidate for a fault-tolerant quantum computer, thanks to its good properties such as scalability, long coherence time and optical accessibility for communication. A big barrier to overcome is non-Pauli errors, erasure errors and leakage errors. Conventional work has revealed that leakage error is convertible to erasure error. A remaining problem is that such (converted) erasure errors continuously happen and accumulate. The previous proposal involved transporting atoms directly from the reservoir area, where atoms are stored for spare, to the computational area, where the computation and the error correction are processed, to correct atom loss. However, transporting atoms takes a long time and has side effects on surrounding qubits in practice. In this study, we evaluate the effects on planar code by circuit-based Monte Carlo simulation which has depolarizing errors and erasure errors, and propose a new scheme to tolerate that problem, namely, \textit{$k$-shift erasure recovery} scheme. Our scheme uses online code deformation to tolerate erasures and repeatedly transfers the logical qubit from an imperfect array in which erasure errors accumulated to another perfect array in which erasure errors have been fixed by offline optical tweezers, to tolerate a large (accumulated) number of erasures. Furthermore, our scheme corrects erasure errors of atom arrays while logical qubits are evacuated from that area to correct; therefore, manipulating optical tweezers for erasure correction does not disturb qubits that compose logical data. We believe that our scheme provides practical directions for Rydberg atom quantum computers to realize feasible fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>Deciding factor for detecting a particle within a subspace via dark and bright states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a measurement-induced continuous-time quantum walk, we address the problem of detecting a particle in a subspace, instead of a fixed position. In this configuration, we develop an approach of bright and dark states based on the unit and vanishing detection probability respectively for a particle-detection in the subspace. Specifically, by employing the rank-nullity theorem, we determine several properties of dark and bright states in terms of energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian used for a quantum walk and the projectors applied to detect the subspace. We provide certain conditions on the position and the rank of the subspace to be detected, resulting in the unit total detection probability, which has broad implications for quantum computing. Further, we illustrate the forms of dark as well as bright states and the dependence of detection probability on the number of dark states by considering a cyclic graph with nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor hopping. Moreover, we observe that the divergence in the average number of measurements for detecting a particle successfully in a subspace can be reduced by performing high rank projectors.</description>

Abstract: Using only elementary calculus we prove that the balanced homodyne detector measures the quadrature phase amplitude of a signal. More precisely, after the measurement of photon numbers $l$, the collapse of the composite state of a strong laser beam and a signal approximates the collapse of the signal to the eigen-state of quadrature phase amplitude with eigen-value $r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms show potential in effectively operating on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. A novel variational approach to reinforcement learning has been recently proposed, incorporating linear-optical interferometers and a classical learning model known as projective simulation (PS). PS is a decision-making tool for reinforcement learning and can be classically represented as a random walk on a graph that describes the agent's memory. In its optical quantum version, this approach utilizes quantum walks of single photons on a mesh of tunable beamsplitters and phase shifters to select actions. In this work, we present the implementation of this algorithm on Ascella, a single-photon-based quantum computer from Quandela. The focus is drawn on solving a test bed task to showcase the potential of the quantum agent with respect to the classical agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification is particularly relevant to Information Retrieval, as it is used in various subtasks of the search pipeline. In this work, we propose a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for multi-class classification of classical data. The model is implemented using PennyLane. The optimization process is conducted by minimizing the cross-entropy loss through parameterized quantum circuit optimization. The QCNN is tested on the MNIST dataset with 4, 6, 8 and 10 classes. The results show that with 4 classes, the performance is slightly lower compared to the classical CNN, while with a higher number of classes, the QCNN outperforms the classical neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-mode stabilized squeezed coherent state (SSCS) of light and introduce the $\Pi_{\rm N}$ indicator, a novel measure for characterizing nonclassicality in the resulting EPR-entangled state. Unlike existing methods based on Cauchy-Schwarz or Murihead inequalities, $\Pi_{\rm N}$ leverages analytical solutions to the quantum Langevin equations to directly analyze nonclassicality arising from key processes like bichromatic injection, frequency conversion, and parametric down-conversion (both spontaneous and stimulated). This approach not only identifies the optimal phase for maximum nonclassicality but also reveals two new phenomena: first, both intra-cavity and extra-cavity fields exhibit the same degree of nonclassicality, and second, balanced seeding in phase-mismatched configurations induces nonclassicality across a broad range of squeezing and seeding parameters. Our work deepens the understanding of the intricate dependence of nonclassicality on system parameters in the context of SSCS, paving the way for investigations into the quantum-to-classical transition in entangled systems. The potential of $\Pi_{\rm N}$ holds significant promise for advancements in quantum optics and information science.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-classicality in the simplest causal network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's theorem prompts us with a fundamental inquiry: what is the simplest scenario leading to the incompatibility between quantum correlations and the classical theory of causality? Here we demonstrate that quantum non-classicality is possible in a network consisting of only three dichotomic variables, without the need of the locality assumption neither external measurement choices. We also show that the use of interventions, a central tool in the field of causal inference, significantly improves the noise robustness of this new kind of non-classical behaviour, making it feasible for experimental tests with current technology.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal PT-symmetric phase transition in a non-Hermitian chiral quantum optical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions, non-Hermiticity and nonreciprocity play central roles in fundamental physics. However, the triple interplay of these three fields is of lack in the quantum domain. Here, we show nonreciprocal parity-time-symmetric phase transition in a non-Hermitian chiral quantum electrodynamical system, caused by the directional system dissipation. In remarkable contrast to previously reported nonreciprocal phase transitions, the nonreciprocal parity-time-symmetric phases appear even when the atom-resonator coupling is reciprocal. Nonreciprocal photon blockade is obtained in the nonreciprocal phase region. These results may deepen the fundamental insight of nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian quantum physics, and also open a new door for unconventional quantum manipulation.</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Unreliable Entanglement Assistance: Interception and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic security is considered with unreliable entanglement assistance, due to one of two reasons: Interception or loss. We consider two corresponding models. In the first model, Eve may intercept the entanglement resource. In the second model, Eve is passive, and the resource may dissipate to the environment beyond her reach. We derive achievable rates for both models, subject to a maximal error criterion and semantic security. As an example, we consider the amplitude damping channel. Under interception, time division is not necessarily possible, and the boundary of our achievable region is disconnected. In the passive model, our rate region outperforms time division.</description>

      <title>Saturating a Fundamental Bound on Quantum Measurements' Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system is usually measured through observations performed on a second quantum system, or meter, to which it is coupled. In this scenario, fundamental limitations arise as stated by the celebrated Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem and its generalizations, predicting an upper-bound on the measurement's accuracy (Ozawa's bound). Here, we show it is possible to saturate this fundamental bound. We propose a simple interferometric setup, arguably within reach of present technology, in which a flying particle (the quantum meter) is used to measure the state of a qubit (the target system). We show that the bound can be saturated and that this happens only if the flying particle is prepared in a Gaussian wavepacket.</description>

      <title>The Localized Active Space Method with Unitary Selective Coupled Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the localized active space unitary selective coupled cluster singles and doubles (LAS-USCCSD) method. Derived from the localized active space unitary coupled cluster (LAS-UCCSD) method, LAS-USCCSD first performs a classical LASSCF calculation, then selectively identifies the most important parameters (cluster amplitudes used to build the multireference UCC ansatz) for restoring inter-fragment interaction energy using this reduced set of parameters with the variational quantum eigensolver method. We benchmark LAS-USCCSD against LAS-UCCSD by calculating the total energies of $(\mathrm{H}_2)_2$, $(\mathrm{H}_2)_4$ and \textit{trans}-butadiene, and the magnetic coupling constant for a bimetallic compound [Cr$_2$(OH)$_3$(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{3+}$. For these systems, we find that LAS-USCCSD reduces the number of required parameters and thus the circuit depth by at least one order of magnitude, an aspect which is important for the practical implementation of multireference hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like LAS-UCCSD on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transition in a large interacting driven atomic ensemble in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that frequentism, as an explanation of probability in classical statistical mechanics, can be extended in a natural way to a decoherent quantum history space, the analogue of a classical phase space. The result is further a form of finite frequentism, in which the Gibbs concept of an infinite ensemble of gases is replaced by the total quantum state expressed in terms of the decoherence basis, as defined by the history space. It is a form of finite and actual frequentism (as opposed to hypothetical frequentism), insofar as all the microstates exist, in keeping with the decoherence-based Everett interpretation, and some versions of pilot-wave theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the electromagnetic vacuum field on a harmonically bound electron. We show that in the electric-dipole approximation the model atom couples only to an effective one-dimensional electric field. In a simplified form, in which the problem is reduced to a single spatial dimension, we determine, analytically, the form of the ground state and discuss the significance of this.</description>

      <title>High-rate quantum LDPC codes for long-range-connected neutral atom registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes with moderate overheads in qubit number and control complexity are highly desirable for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recently, quantum error correction has experienced significant progress both in code development and experimental realizations, with neutral atom qubit architecture rapidly establishing itself as a leading platform in the field. Scalable quantum computing will require processing with QEC codes that have low qubit overhead and large error suppression, and while such codes do exist, they involve a degree of non-locality that has yet to be integrated into experimental platforms. In this work, we analyze a family of high-rate Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes with limited long-range interactions and outline a near-term implementation in neutral atom registers. By means of circuit-level simulations, we find that these codes outperform surface codes in all respects when the two-qubit nearest neighbour gate error probability is below $\sim 0.1\%$. We show how these codes can be natively integrated in two-dimensional static neutral atom qubit architectures with open boundaries, where the desired long-range connectivity can be targeted via Rydberg-blockade interaction. Our protocol solely requires multiple laser colors to enable transitions to different Rydberg states for different interatomic distances.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi entropy of the permutationally invariant part of the ground state across a quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the permutationally invariant part of the density matrix (PIDM) in capturing the properties of the ground state of the system during a quantum phase transition. In the context of quantum state tomography, PIDM is known to be obtainable with only a low number of measurement settings, namely $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$, where $L$ is the system size. Considering the transverse-field Ising chain as an example, we compute the second-order R\'enyi entropy of PIDM for the ground state by using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. In the ferromagnetic case, the ground state is permutationally invariant both in the limits of zero and infinite field, leading to vanishing R\'enyi entropy of PIDM. The latter exhibits a broad peak as a function of the transverse field around the quantum critical point, which gets more pronounced for larger system size. In the antiferromagnetic case, the peak structure disappears and the R\'enyi entropy diverges like $\mathcal{O}(L)$ in the whole field range of the ordered phase. We discuss the cause of these behaviors of the R\'enyi entropy of PIDM, examining the possible application of this experimentally tractable quantity to the analysis of phase transition phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the challenges that the standard (Humean and non-Humean) accounts of laws face within the framework of quantum gravity where space and time may not be fundamental. This paper identifies core (meta)physical features that cut across a number of quantum gravity approaches and formalisms and that provide seeds for articulating updated conceptions that could account for QG laws not involving any spatio-temporal notions. To this aim, we will in particular highlight the constitutive roles of quantum entanglement, quantum transition amplitudes and quantum causal histories. These features also stress the fruitful overlap between quantum gravity and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Recoil heating of a dielectric particle illuminated by a linearly polarized plane wave within the Rayleigh regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recoil heating phenomenon experienced by a dielectric spherical particle when it interacts with a linearly polarized plane wave within the Rayleigh regime. We derive the fluctuating force acted upon the particle arising from the fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields. Our derivations reveal that the spectral density of the fluctuating force along the propagation direction is $7\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$. Meanwhile, along the direction of the electric and magnetic fields, it is $11\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$ and $2\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$, respectively. Here, $P_{\mathrm{scat}}$ denotes the power scattered by the particle, $\hbar\omega_0$ represents the energy of a photon, and $c$ is the speed of light. Recoil heating imposes fundamental limitations in levitated optomechanics, constraining the minimum temperatures achievable in cooling processes, the coherence time of the system, and the sensitivity of force measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the quantum-bouncer experiment involving ultracold neutrons in a braneworld scenario. Extra-dimensional theories typically predict the strengthening of gravitational interactions over short distances. In this paper, we specifically study the anomalous gravitational interaction between the bouncing neutron and the reflecting mirror, resulting from hidden dimensions, and its effect on the outcome of this experiment in the context of a thickbrane model. This analysis allows us to identify which physical quantity of this extra-dimensional theory this neutron experiment is capable of constraining. Based on the experimental data, we found a new and independent empirical bound on free parameters of the model: the higher-dimensional gravitational constant and a parameter related to a transverse width of the confined matter inside the thickbrane. This new bound is valid in scenarios with an arbitrary number of extra dimensions greater than two. In this manner, by considering the thickness of the brane, we have been able to extend previous studies on this topic, which were limited to models with few codimensions, due to non-computability problems of power-law corrections of the gravitational potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials, and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton splittings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, the entanglement entropy is calculated at the quantum multicritical point of the random transverse-field Ising model (RTIM). We use an efficient implementation of the strong disorder renormalization group method in two and three dimensions for two types of disorder. For cubic subsystems we find a universal logarithmic corner contribution to the area law b*ln(l) that is independent of the form of disorder. Our results agree qualitatively with those at the quantum critical points of the RTIM, but with new b prefactors due to having both geometric and quantum fluctuations at play. By studying the vicinity of the multicritical point, we demonstrate that the corner contribution serves as an `entanglement susceptibility', a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponents.</description>

Abstract: Thermalization of an isolated quantum system has been a nontrivial problem since the early days of quantum mechanics. In generic isolated quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics is expected to result in thermalization, indicating the emergence of statistical mechanics from quantum dynamics. However, what feature of a many-body quantum system facilitates quantum thermalization is still not well understood. Recent experimental advancements have shown that entanglement may act as a thermalizing agent, not universally but particularly. Here, we theoretically show that the thermal averages of an observable in an isolated many-body quantum system with a large number of degrees of freedom emerge from the entangled energy eigenstates of the system. In particular, we show that the expectation values of an observable in entangled energy eigenstates and its marginals are equivalent to the microcanonical and canonical averages of the observable.</description>

Abstract: Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem states that a non-contextual hidden-variable theory cannot completely reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. Asher Peres gave a remarkably simple proof of quantum contextuality in a four-dimensional Hilbert space of two spin-1/2 particles. Peres's argument is enormously simpler than that of Kochen and Specker. Peres contextuality demonstrates a logical contradiction between quantum mechanics and the noncontextual hidden variable models by showing an inconsistency when assigning noncontextual definite values to a certain set of quantum observables. In this work, we present a proof of quantum contextuality in time using the temporal version of Peres's contextuality argument. In analogy with the two-particle version of Peres's contextuality argument in the context of spin measurements at two different locations, we consider here single-particle spin measurements at two different times t=t1 and t=t2 where the context is provided through the time separation. Our results can be experimentally verified with the present quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Many-body Dynamics in Monitored Atomic Gases Without Post-Selection Barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00841v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a monitored ensemble of atoms driven by a laser field and in the presence of collective decay. The properties of the quantum trajectories describing the atomic cloud drastically depend on the monitoring protocol and are distinct from those of the average density matrix. By varying the strength of the external drive, a measurement-induced phase transition occurs separating two phases with entanglement entropy scaling sub-extensively with the system size. Incidentally, the critical point coincides with the superradiance transition of the trajectory-averaged dynamics. Our setup is implementable in current light-matter interaction devices, and most notably, the monitored dynamics is free from the post-selection measurement problem, even in the case of imperfect monitoring.</description>

      <title>Code conversion with the quantum Golay code for a universal transversal gate set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code and $[[23,1,7]]$ quantum Golay code have been identified as good candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computing via code concatenation. These two codes have transversal implementations of all Clifford gates, but require some other scheme for fault-tolerant $T$ gates. Using magic states, Clifford operations, and measurements is one common scheme, but magic state distillation can have a large overhead. Code conversion is one avenue for implementing a universal gate set fault-tolerantly without the use of magic state distillation. Analogously to how the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code can be fault-tolerantly converted to and from the $[[15,1,3]]$ Reed-Muller code which has a transversal $T$ gate, the $[[23,1,7]]$ Golay code can be converted to a $[[95,1,7]]$ triorthogonal code with a transversal $T$ gate. A crucial ingredient to this procedure is the $[[49,1,5]]$ triorthogonal code, which can itself be seen as related to the self-dual $[[17,1,5]]$ 2D color code. Additionally, a method for code conversion based on a transversal CNOT between the codes, rather than stabilizer measurements, is described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate atomic chains with different spatial configurations coupled to a ring cavity comprising two counterpropagating traveling modes. We describe the collective atom-light scattering effect with a structure factor of the atomic chain and demonstrate that the interactions between the atoms and the cavity are controlled by the structure factor, resulting in distinctly different collective excitation modes and energy spectrum than for Fabry-P\'erot cavities. Remarkably, we observe that a cavity dark mode emerges when the atomic spacings are integer multiples of the half-wavelength. The nodes of this standing-wave dark mode align precisely with the atomic positions, enabling intracavity field conversion without free-space scattering. By adjusting the configuration of the atomic chain, we realize tunable photon routing and a large optical phase shift with almost no photon loss, which can be used to implement versatile building blocks for optical quantum engineering.</description>

Abstract: Estimating properties of quantum states via randomized measurements has become a significant part of quantum information science. In this paper, we design an innovative approach leveraging metasurfaces to perform randomized measurements on photonic qubits, together with error mitigation techniques that suppress realistic metasurface measurement noise. Through fidelity and purity estimation, we confirm the capability of metasurfaces to implement randomized measurements and the unbiased nature of our error-mitigated estimator. Our findings show the potential of metasurface-based randomized measurement schemes in achieving robust and resource-efficient estimation of quantum state properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noiseless measurement of a single quadrature in systems of parametrically coupled oscillators is theoretically possible by pumping at the sum and difference frequencies of the two oscillators, realizing a backaction-evading (BAE) scheme. Although this would hold true in the simplest scenario for a system with pure three-wave mixing, implementations of this scheme are hindered by unwanted higher-order parametric processes that destabilize the system and add noise. We show analytically that detuning the two pumps from the sum and difference frequencies can stabilize the system and fully recover the BAE performance, enabling operation at otherwise inaccessible cooperativities. We also show that the acceleration demonstrated in a weak signal detection experiment [PRX QUANTUM 4, 020302 (2023)] was only achievable because of this detuning technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep neural networks, is of great interest. This heightened focus stems from the widespread use of AI-backed systems. These systems, often relying on intricate neural architectures, can exhibit behavior that is challenging to explain and comprehend. The interpretability of such models is a crucial component of building trusted systems. Many methods exist to approach this problem, but they do not apply straightforwardly to the quantum setting. Here, we explore the interpretability of quantum neural networks using local model-agnostic interpretability measures commonly utilized for classical neural networks. Following this analysis, we generalize a classical technique called LIME, introducing Q-LIME, which produces explanations of quantum neural networks. A feature of our explanations is the delineation of the region in which data samples have been given a random label, likely subjects of inherently random quantum measurements. We view this as a step toward understanding how to build responsible and accountable quantum AI models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum state distance and develop a family of geometrical quantum speed limits (QSLs) for open and closed systems. The QSL time includes an alternative function by which we derive three QSL times with particularly chosen functions. It indicates that two QSL times are exactly the ones presented in Ref. [1] and [2], respectively, and the third one can provide a unified QSL time for both open and closed systems. The three QSL times are attainable for any given initial state in the sense that there exists a dynamics driving the initial state to evolve along the geodesic. We numerically compare the tightness of the three QSL times, which typically promises a tighter QSL time if optimizing the alternative function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: sQUlearn introduces a user-friendly, NISQ-ready Python library for quantum machine learning (QML), designed for seamless integration with classical machine learning tools like scikit-learn. The library's dual-layer architecture serves both QML researchers and practitioners, enabling efficient prototyping, experimentation, and pipelining. sQUlearn provides a comprehensive toolset that includes both quantum kernel methods and quantum neural networks, along with features like customizable data encoding strategies, automated execution handling, and specialized kernel regularization techniques. By focusing on NISQ-compatibility and end-to-end automation, sQUlearn aims to bridge the gap between current quantum computing capabilities and practical machine learning applications. The library provides substantial flexibility, enabling quick transitions between the underlying quantum frameworks Qiskit and PennyLane, as well as between simulation and running on actual hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging Beyond the Standard-Quantum Limit and Phase Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensing using non-linear interferometers offers the possibility of bicolour imaging, using light that never interacted with the object of interest, and provides a way to achieve phase supersensitivity, i.e. a Heisenberg-type scaling of the phase uncertainty. Such a scaling behaviour is extremely susceptible to noise and only arises at specific phases that define the optimal working point of the device. While phase-shifting algorithms are to some degree robust against the deleterious effects induced by noise they extract an image by tuning the interferometer phase over a broad range, implying an operation beyond the working point. In our theoretical study, we investigate both the spontaneous and the high-gain regime of operation of a non-linear interferometer. In fact, in the spontaneous regime using a distillation technique and operating at the working point leads to a qualitatively similar behaviour. In the high-gain regime, however, typical distillation techniques inherently forbid a scaling better than the standard-quantum limit, as a consequence of the photon statistics of squeezed vacuum. In contrast, an operation at the working point still may lead to a sensitivity below shot noise, even in the presence of noise. Therefore, this procedure opens the perspective of bicolour imaging with a better than shot-noise phase uncertainty by working in the vicinity of the working point. Our results transfer quantum imaging distillation in a noisy environment to the high-gain regime with the ultimate goal of harnessing its full potential by combining bicolour imaging and phase supersensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocality is the defining feature of quantum entanglement. Entangled states with multiple particles are of crucial importance in fundamental tests of quantum physics as well as in many quantum information tasks. One of the archetypal multipartite quantum states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, allows one to observe the striking conflict of quantum physics to local realism in the so-called all-versus-nothing way. This is profoundly different from Bell's theorem for two particles, which relies on statistical predictions. Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic chip capable of generating and manipulating the four-photon GHZ state. We perform a complete characterization of the four-photon GHZ state using quantum state tomography and obtain a state fidelity of 0.729(6). We further use the all-versus-nothing test and the Mermin inequalities to witness the quantum nonlocality of GHZ entanglement. Our work paves the way to perform fundamental tests of quantum physics with complex integrated quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the complete geometric properties of quantum states, with the symmetric part being the quantum metric, and the antisymmetric part being the Berry curvature. We propose a generic Hamiltonian with global degenerate ground states, and give a general relation between the corresponding non-Abelian quantum metric and unit Bloch vector. This enables us to construct the relation between the non-Abelian quantum metric and Berry or Euler curvature. To be concrete, we present and study two topological semimetal models with global degenerate bands under CP and $C_2T$ symmetries, respectively. The topological invariants of these two degenerate topological semimetals are the Chern number and Euler class, respectively, which are calculated from the non-Abelian quantum metric with our constructed relations. Based on the adiabatic perturbation theory, we further obtain the relation between the non-Abelian quantum metric and the energy fluctuation. Such a non-adiabatic effect can be used to extract the non-Abelian quantum metric, which is numerically demonstrated for the two models of degenerate topological semimetals. Finally, we discuss the quantum simulation of the model Hamiltonians with cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the breaking of the Lorentz symmetry at the Planck length in quantum mechanics. We use three-dimensional p-adic vectors as position variables, while the time remains a real number. In this setting, the Planck length is 1/p, where p is a prime number, and the Lorentz symmetry is naturally broken. The p-adic the Planck length is independent of the speed of light and is determined by the group of symmetries of the space. In the Dirac and von Neumann formalism framework for quantum mechanics, we introduce a new p-adic Dirac equation that predicts the existence of particles and antiparticles and charge conjugation like the standard one. The discreteness of the p-adic space imposes substantial restrictions on the solutions of the new equation. This equation admits localized solutions, which is impossible in the standard case. We show that an isolated quantum system whose evolution is controlled by the p-adic Dirac equation does not satisfy the Einstein causality, which means that the speed of light is not the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy can travel through space. This fact does not imply immediately that the speed of light is infinite. The new p-adic Dirac equation is not intended to replace the standard one; it should be understood as a new version (or a limit) of the classical equation at the Planck length scale.</description>

      <title>Multifold enhancement of quantum SNR by using an EMCCD as a photon number resolving device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Devices (EMCCD), owing to their high quantum efficiency and spatial resolution, are widely used to study typical quantum optical phenomena and related applications. Researchers have already developed a procedure that enables one to statistically determine whether a pixel detects a single photon, based on whether its output is higher or lower than the estimated noise level. However, these techniques are feasible at extremely low photon numbers (about 0.15 mean number of photons per pixel per exposure), allowing for at most one photon per pixel. This limitation necessitates a very large number of frames required for any study. In this work, we present a method to estimate the mean rate of photons per pixel per frame for arbitrary exposure time. Subsequently, we make a statistical estimate of the number of photons (greater than or equal to 1) incident on each pixel. This allows us to effectively utilize the EMCCD as a photon number resolving device. This immediately augments the acceptable light levels in the experiments, leading to significant reduction in the required experimentation time. As evidence of our approach, we quantify contrast in quantum correlation exhibited by a pair of spatially entangled photons generated by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion process. In comparison to conventional methods, our method realizes an enhancement in the signal to noise ratio by about a factor of 3 for half the data collection time. This SNR can be easily enhanced by minor modifications in experimental parameters such as exposure time etc.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-qubit gates between a flying photon and an atom in a cavity. The atom-photon gate setup consists of a cavity and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with doubly degenerate ground and excited state energy levels mediating the atom-light interaction. We provide an error analysis of the gate and model important errors, including spatial mode mismatch between the photon and the cavity, spontaneous emission, cavity losses, detunings, and random fluctuations of the cavity parameters and frequencies. Error analysis shows that the gate protocol is more robust against experimental errors compared to previous atom-photon gates and achieves higher fidelity.</description>

      <title>A Note on Output Length of One-Way State Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the output length of one-way state generators (OWSGs), their weaker variants, and EFIs.
  - Standard OWSGs. Recently, Cavalar et al. (arXiv:2312.08363) give OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(\log \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, and conjecture that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. We prove their conjecture in a stronger manner by showing that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. This means that their construction is optimal in terms of output length.
  - Inverse-polynomial-advantage OWSGs. Let $\epsilon$-OWSGs be a parameterized variant of OWSGs where a quantum polynomial-time adversary's advantage is at most $\epsilon$. For any constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$, we construct $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with $((c+1)\log \lambda+O(1))$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with at most $(c\log \lambda-2)$-qubit outputs.
  - Constant-advantage OWSGs. For any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct $\epsilon$-OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of subexponentially secure OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $O(1)$-OWSGs with $((\log \log \lambda)/2+O(1))$-qubit outputs.
  - Weak OWSGs. We refer to $(1-1/\mathsf{poly}(\lambda))$-OWSGs as weak OWSGs. We construct weak OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(1)$ assuming the existence of exponentially secure OWFs with linear expansion. We show that this is tight by proving that there do not exist weak OWSGs with $O(1)$-qubit outputs.
  - EFIs. We show that there do not exist $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs. We show that this is tight by proving that there exist $\omega(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs assuming the existence of exponentially secure PRGs.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, anticipated to drive breakthroughs in computational tasks. This paper discusses the question which security concerns and strengths are connected to QML by means of a systematic literature review. We categorize and review the security of QML models, their vulnerabilities inherent to quantum architectures, and the mitigation strategies proposed. The survey reveals that while QML possesses unique strengths, it also introduces novel attack vectors not seen in classical systems. We point out specific risks, such as cross-talk in superconducting systems and forced repeated shuttle operations in ion-trap systems, which threaten QML's reliability. However, approaches like adversarial training, quantum noise exploitation, and quantum differential privacy have shown potential in enhancing QML robustness. Our review discuss the need for continued and rigorous research to ensure the secure deployment of QML in real-world applications. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to navigate the security aspects of QML.</description>

      <title>Open dynamics of entanglement in mesoscopic bosonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key issue in Quantum Information is finding an adequate description of mesoscopic systems that is simpler than full quantum formalism yet retains crucial information about non-classical phenomena like entanglement. In particular, the study of fully bosonic systems undergoing open evolution is of great importance for the advancement of photonic quantum computing and communication. In this paper, we propose a mesoscopic description of such systems based on boson number correlations. This description allows for tracking Markovian open evolution of entanglement of both non-Gaussian and Gaussian states and their sub-Poissonian statistics. It can be viewed as a generalization of the reduced state of the field formalism [Entropy 2019, 21(7), 705], which by itself does not contain information about entanglement. As our approach adopts the structure of the description of two particles in terms of first quantization, it allows for broad intuitive usage of known tools. Using the proposed formalism, we show the robustness of entanglement against low-temperature damping for four-mode bright squeezed vacuum state and beam-splitted single photon. We also present a generalization of the Mandel Q parameter. Building upon this, we show that the entanglement of the state obtained by beam splitting of a single occupied mode is fully inherited from sub-Poissonian statistics of the input state.</description>

Abstract: A Normalizing Flow computes a bijective mapping from an arbitrary distribution to a predefined (e.g. normal) distribution. Such a flow can be used to address different tasks, e.g. anomaly detection, once such a mapping has been learned. In this work we introduce Normalizing Flows for Quantum architectures, describe how to model and optimize such a flow and evaluate our method on example datasets. Our proposed models show competitive performance for anomaly detection compared to classical methods, esp. those ones where there are already quantum inspired algorithms available. In the experiments we compare our performance to isolation forests (IF), the local outlier factor (LOF) or single-class SVMs.</description>

      <title>Reductive Quantum Phase Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating a quantum phase is a necessary task in a wide range of fields of quantum science. To accomplish this task, two well-known methods have been developed in distinct contexts, namely, Ramsey interferometry (RI) in atomic and molecular physics and quantum phase estimation (QPE) in quantum computing. We demonstrate that these canonical examples are instances of a larger class of phase estimation protocols, which we call reductive quantum phase estimation (RQPE) circuits. Here we present an explicit algorithm that allows one to create an RQPE circuit. This circuit distinguishes an arbitrary set of phases with a fewer number of qubits and unitary applications, thereby solving a general class of quantum hypothesis testing to which RI and QPE belong. We further demonstrate a trade-off between measurement precision and phase distinguishability, which allows one to tune the circuit to be optimal for a specific application.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and whose curvature is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, where Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Conventional Floquet systems also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>

Abstract: Qubits are the fundamental building blocks of quantum information science and applications, whose concept is widely utilized in both quantum physics and quantum computation. While the significance of qubits and their implementation in physical devices have been extensively examined, now is the right time to revisit this understanding. In this paper, we introduce an abstract qubit model (AQM), offering a mathematical framework for higher-level algorithms and applications, and setting forth criteria for lower-level physical devices to enable quantum computation. We first provide a comprehensive definition of "qubits", regarded as the foundational principle for quantum computing algorithms (bottom-up support), and examine their requisites for devices (top-down demand). We then investigate the feasibility of relaxing specific requirements, thereby broadening device support while considering techniques that tradeoff extra costs to counterbalance this relaxation. Lastly, we delve into the quantum applications that only require partial support of "qubits", and discuss the physical systems with limited support of the AQM but remain valuable in quantum applications. AQM may serve as an intermediate interface between quantum algorithms and devices, facilitating quantum algorithm-device co-design.</description>

      <title>Magic-induced computational separation in entanglement theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as a foundational pillar in quantum information theory, delineating the boundary between what is classical and what is quantum. The common assumption is that higher entanglement corresponds to a greater degree of `quantumness'. However, this folk belief is challenged by the fact that classically simulable operations, such as Clifford circuits, can create highly entangled states. The simulability of these states raises a question: what are the differences between `low-magic' entanglement, and `high-magic' entanglement? We answer this question in this work with a rigorous investigation into the role of magic in entanglement theory. We take an operational approach to understanding this relationship by studying tasks such as entanglement estimation, distillation and dilution. This approach reveals that magic has notable implications for entanglement. Specifically, we find an operational separation that divides Hilbert space into two distinct regimes: the entanglement-dominated (ED) phase and magic-dominated (MD) phase. Roughly speaking, ED states have entanglement that significantly surpasses their magic, while MD states have magic that dominates their entanglement. The competition between the two resources in these two phases induces a computational phase separation between them: there are {sample- and time-efficient} quantum algorithms for almost any entanglement task on ED states, while these tasks are {provably computationally intractable} in the MD phase. Our results find applications in diverse areas such as quantum error correction, many-body physics, and the study of quantum chaos, providing a unifying framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems. We also offer theoretical explanations for previous numerical observations, highlighting the broad implications of the ED-MD distinction across various subfields of physics.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation and study the possibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit Hilbert space in one of larger dimension. The results are illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Entangled time-crystal phase in an open quantum light-matter system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-crystals are nonequilibrium many-body phases in which the state of the system dynamically approaches a limit cycle. While these phases are recently in the focus of intensive research, it is still far from clear whether they can host quantum correlations. In fact, mostly classical correlations have been observed so far and time-crystals appear to be effectively classical high-entropy phases. Here, we consider the nonequilibrium behavior of an open quantum light-matter system, realizable in current experiments, which maps onto a paradigmatic time-crystal model after an adiabatic elimination of the light field. The system displays a bistable regime, with coexistent time-crystal and stationary phases, terminating at a tricritical point from which a second-order phase transition line departs. While light and matter are uncorrelated in the stationary phase, the time-crystal phase features bipartite correlations, both of quantum and classical nature. Our work unveils that time-crystal phases in collective open quantum systems can sustain quantum correlations, including entanglement, and are thus more than effectively classical many-body phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Effects on the Squeezing of Axion Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is assumed in standard cosmology that the Universe underwent a period of inflation in its earliest phase, providing the seeds for structure formation through vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field. These fluctuations get stretched by the quasi-exponential expansion of the Universe and become squeezed. The aim of this paper is to deepen the understanding of the squeezing process, considering the effect of self-interactions. Axion-like particles can provide a useful setup to study this effect. Specifically we focus on the consequences that a non-trivial evolution of the background axion field has on the squeezing of the perturbations. We follow the evolution of the axion's fluctuation modes from the horizon exit during inflation to the radiation-dominated epoch. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and squeezing parameters, which are linked to the axion particle number and isocurvature perturbation. We find that the quantum mechanical particle production and the squeezing of the perturbations are enhanced, if one accounts for anharmonic effects, i.e., the effect of higher order terms in the potential. This effect becomes particularly strong towards the hilltop of the potential.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Floquet quantum East model (a Trotterized version of the kinetically constrained quantum East spin chain) at its "deterministic point", where evolution is defined in terms of CNOT permutation gates. We solve exactly the thermalization dynamics for a broad class of initial product states by means of "space evolution". We prove: (i) the entanglement of a block of spins grows at most at one-half the maximal speed allowed by locality (i.e., half the speed of dual-unitary circuits); (ii) if the block of spins is initially prepared in a classical configuration, speed of entanglement is a quarter of the maximum; (iii) thermalization to the infinite temperature state is reached exactly in a time that scales with the size of the block.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Stokes-Mueller method to calculate the cross sections associated with multiple Compton scattering of an arbitrary two-photon system. This method is used to calculate the cross section in the scenario in which one of the maximally entangled annihilation photons undergoes intermediate Compton scattering followed by the detection of both photons using a pair of Compton polarimeters. The method accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects caused by Compton scattering. Despite being grounded in quantum field theory, the method does not require an in-depth understanding of its typically intricate prerequisites. As a result, this method is anticipated to be accessible to a broader community of physicists and is readily applicable in Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich structure of transverse spatial modes of structured light has facilitated their extensive applications in quantum information and optical communication. The Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, which carry a well-defined orbital angular momentum (OAM), consist of a complete orthogonal basis describing the transverse spatial modes of light. The application of OAM in free-space optical communication is restricted due to the experimentally limited OAM numbers and the complex OAM recognition methods. Here, we present a novel method that uses the advanced deep learning technique for LG modes recognition. By discretizing the spatial modes of structured light, we turn the OAM state regression into classification. A proof-of-principle experiment is also performed, showing that our method effectively categorizes OAM states with small training samples and high accuracy. By assigning each category a classical information, we further apply our approach to an image transmission task, demonstrating the ability to encode large data with low OAM number. This work opens up a new avenue for achieving high-capacity optical communication with low OAM number based on structured light.</description>

Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Analytic thermodynamic properties of the Lieb-Liniger gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we address the relation between the star exponentials emerging within the Deformation Quantization formalism and Feynman's path integrals associated with propagators in quantum dynamics. In order to obtain such a relation, we start by visualizing the quantum propagator as an integral transform of the star exponential by means of the symbol corresponding to the time evolution operator and, thus, we introduce Feynman's path integral representation of the propagator as a sum over all the classical histories. The star exponential thus constructed has the advantage that it does not depend on the convergence of formal series, as commonly understood within the context of Deformation Quantization. We include some basic examples to illustrate our findings, recovering standard results reported in the literature. Further, for an arbitrary finite dimensional system, we use the star exponential introduced here in order to find a particular representation of the star product which resembles the one encountered in the context of the quantum field theory for a Poisson sigma model.</description>
