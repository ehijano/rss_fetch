      <title>Two timescales in stochastic evolutionary games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence of discrete-time Markov chains with two timescales is a powerful tool to study stochastic evolutionary games in subdivided populations. Focusing on linear games within demes, convergence to a diffusion process for the strategy frequencies as the population size increases yields a strong-migration limit. The same limit is obtained for a linear game in a well-mixed population with effective payoffs that depend on reproductive values and identity measures between individuals. The first-order effect of selection on the fixation probability of a strategy introduced as a single mutant can be calculated by using the diffusion approximation, or alternatively by summing the successive expected changes in the mutant strategy frequency that involve expected coalescence times of ancestral lines under neutrality. These can be approached by resorting to the existence of two timescales in the genealogical process. Keeping the population size fixed but letting the intensity of migration go to zero, convergence to a continuous-time Markov chain after instantaneous initial transitions yields a low-migration limit that depends on fixation probabilities within demes in the absence of migration. In the limit of small uniform dispersal, the fixation probability of a mutant strategy in the whole population exceeds its initial frequency if it is risk-dominant over the other strategy with respect to the overall average payoffs in pairwise interactions. Finally, in the low-mutation limit in the presence of recurrent mutation, the average abundance of a strategy in the long run is determined by the fixation probabilities of both strategies when introduced as single mutants in a deme chosen at random.</description>

      <title>Qualitative analysis of HAART effects on HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIV is known for causing the destruction of the immune system by affecting different types of cells, while SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious virus that leads to the development of COVID-19. In this study, we propose a mathematical model to investigate the interaction between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 under highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We determine the conditions for the endemic equilibria of both viruses, showing that transcritical bifurcations occur when the basic reproduction numbers of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 pass through 1. We set the condition for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium point of the model with coinfection as a function of the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$. Through numerical simulations, we conclude that HAART, used to control HIV, also reduces the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in coinfected hosts. These findings provide important insights into the epidemiological dynamics of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.</description>

      <title>Independence in Integrated Population Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated population models (IPMs) combine multiple ecological data types such as capture-mark-recapture histories, reproduction surveys, and population counts into a single statistical framework. In such models, each data type is generated by a probabilistic submodel, and an assumption of independence between the different data types is usually made. The fact that the same biological individuals can contribute to multiple data types has been perceived as affecting their independence, and several studies have even investigated IPM robustness in this scenario. However, what matters from a statistical perspective is probabilistic independence: the joint probability of observing all data is equal to the product of the likelihoods of the various datasets. Contrary to a widespread perception, probabilistic non-independence does not automatically result from collecting data on the same physical individuals. Conversely, while there can be good reasons for non-independence of IPM submodels arising from sharing of individuals between data types, these relations do not seem to be included in IPMs whose robustness is being investigated. Furthermore, conditional rather than true independence is sometimes assumed. In this conceptual paper, I survey the various independence concepts used in IPMs, try to make sense of them by getting back to first principles in toy models, and show that it is possible to obtain probabilistic independence (or near-independence) despite two or three data types collected on the same set of biological individuals. I then revisit recommendations pertaining to component data collection and IPM robustness checks, and provide some suggestions to bridge the current gap between individual-level IPMs and their population-level approximations using composite likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary constraints for the endemicity of rapidly evolving viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antigenic escape constitutes the main mechanism allowing rapidly evolving viruses to achieve endemicity. Beyond granting immune escape, empirical evidence also suggests that mutations of viruses might increase their inter-host transmissibility. While both mechanisms are well-studied individually, their combined effects on viral endemicity remain to be explored. Here we propose a minimal eco-evolutionary framework to simulate epidemic outbreaks generated by pathogens evolving both their transmissibility and immune escape. Our findings uncover a very rich phenomenology arising from the complex interplay between both evolutionary pathways and the underlying contagion dynamics. We first show that contagions at the population level constrain the effective evolution of the virus, accelerating the increase in transmissibility in the first epidemic wave while favoring antigenic variation in the transition to the endemic phase. Our results also reveal that accounting for both evolutionary pathways changes the features of the viruses more prone to become endemic. While chances for endemicity increase with infectiousness of the wild-type variant for viruses not evolving their transmissibility, a non-monotonic behavior is observed when the latter mechanism is included, favoring less transmissible viruses and impairing those ones with intermediate infectiousness.</description>

      <title>How oscillations in SIRS epidemic models are affected by the distribution of immunity times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for resident infectious diseases, like the SIRS model, may settle into an endemic state with constant numbers of susceptible ($S$), infected ($I$) and recovered ($R$) individuals, where recovered individuals attain a temporary immunity to reinfection. For many infectious pathogens, infection dynamics may also show periodic outbreaks corresponding to a limit cycle in phase space. One way to reproduce oscillations in SIRS models is to include a non-exponential dwell-time distribution in the recovered state. Here, we study a SIRS model with a step-function-like kernel for the immunity time, mapping out the model's full phase diagram. Using the kernel series framework, we are able to identify the onset of periodic outbreaks when successively broadening the step-width. We further investigate the shape of the outbreaks, finding that broader steps cause more sinusoidal oscillations while more uniform immunity time distributions are related to sharper outbreaks occurring after extended periods of low infection activity.
  Our main results concern recovery distributions characterized by a single dominant timescale. We also consider recovery distributions with two timescales, which may be observed when two or more distinct recovery processes co-exist. Surprisingly, two qualitatively different limit cycles are found to be stable in this case, with only one of the two limit cycles emerging via a standard supercritical Hopf bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Identifiability analysis of vaccination decision-making dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variations in individuals' perceptions of vaccination and decision-making processes can give rise to poor vaccination coverage. The future vaccination promotion programs will benefit from understanding this heterogeneity amongst groups within a population and, accordingly, tailoring the communication strategies. Motivated by this, we developed a mechanistic model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations that
  categorizes individuals based on two factors: (i) perceived payoff gains for vaccination and (ii} decision-making strategies where we assumed that individuals may behave as either myopic rationalists, going for a dose of vaccine if doing so maximizes their perceived payoff gain, or success-based learners, waiting to observe feedback on vaccination before deciding.
  We then investigated the global identifiability of group proportions and perceived payoff gains, that is, the possibility of globally retrieving these parameters by observing the error-free cumulative proportion of vaccinated individuals over time.
  To do so, for each group, we assumed a piecewise constant payoff gain and, for each time interval, obtained the so-called generalized input-output equation. We then proved the global identifiability of these parameters under certain conditions.
  Global identifiability opens the door to reliable estimations of the group proportions and their perceived payoffs.</description>

      <title>Closing the complexity gap of the double distance problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement has been an active area of research in computational comparative genomics for the last three decades. While initially mostly an interesting algorithmic endeavor, now the practical application by applying rearrangement distance methods and more advanced phylogenetic tasks is becoming common practice, given the availability of many completely sequenced genomes. Several genome rearrangement models have been developed over time, sometimes with surprising computational properties. A prominent example is the fact that computing the reversal distance of two signed permutations is possible in linear time, while for two unsigned permutations it is NP-hard. Therefore one has always to be careful about the precise problem formulation and complexity analysis of rearrangement problems in order not to be fooled. The double distance is the minimum number of genomic rearrangements between a singular and a duplicated genome that, in addition to rearrangements, are separated by a whole genome duplication. At the same time it allows to assign the genes of the duplicated genome to the two paralogous chromosome copies that existed right after the duplication event. Computing the double distance is another example of a tricky hardness landscape: If the distance measure underlying the double distance is the simple breakpoint distance, the problem can be solved in linear time, while with the more elaborate DCJ distance it is NP-hard. Indeed, there is a family of distance measures, parameterized by an even number k, between the breakpoint distance (k=2) and the DCJ distance (k=\infty). Little was known about the hardness border between these extremes; the problem complexity was known only for k=4 and k=6. In this paper, we close the gap, providing a full picture of the hardness landscape when computing the double distance.</description>

      <title>Phylo2Vec: a vector representation for binary trees</title>

Abstract: Binary phylogenetic trees inferred from biological data are central to understanding the shared history among evolutionary units. However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search, using different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.</description>

      <title>Natural Averaging May Complement Known Biological Constraints in Bi-parental Reproduction's Advantages Over Mono-parental in Conserving Species Quantitative Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commonly recognized evolutionarily relevant effects of sexual reproduction include increased diversity, accelerated adaptation, and constrained accumulation of deleterious mutations, along with a secondary effect of species genotype homogenization. Still, strong published arguments prioritize the contribution of biological mechanisms underlying bi-parental reproduction to maintaining species identity above their contribution to diversity. Here, we contribute to the latter position. In an initial mathematical analysis and simulation, we show that in an environment where copying is prone to error, quantitative polygenic traits that are shared within a parents' generation are transmitted to future generations under bi-parental reproduction with less deviation than under asexual reproduction. Furthermore, we abstract away many biological details, and show that this trait conservation is a general statistical effect, driven by the very nature of mixing of parental traits, separately from DNA repair and from the reproductive failures, barriers and disadvantages induced by biological mechanisms. Since survival of ecosystem interaction networks depends on the ability of individuals to replace the networked function of failing, dying or absent members of the same species, more faithful inheritance of common traits helps sustain species and ecosystems. This sustaining effect may have contributed to the very evolution of sexual reproduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide variety of stochastic models of cladogenesis (based on speciation and extinction) lead to an identical distribution on phylogenetic tree shapes once the edge lengths are ignored. By contrast, the distribution of the tree's edge lengths is generally quite sensitive to the underlying model. In this paper, we review the impact of different model choices on tree shape and edge length distribution, and its impact for studying the properties of phylogenetic diversity (PD) as a measure of biodiversity, and the loss of PD as species become extinct at the present. We also compare PD with a stochastic model of feature diversity, and investigate some mathematical links and inequalities between these two measures plus their predictions concerning the loss of biodiversity under extinction at the present.</description>

      <title>The evolution of complexity and the transition to biochemical life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While modern physics and biology satisfactorily explain the passage from the Big Bang to the formation of Earth and the first cells to present-day life, respectively, the origins of biochemical life still remain an open question. Since life, as we know it, requires extremely long genetic polymers, any answer to the question must explain how an evolving system of polymers of ever-increasing length could come about on a planet that otherwise consisted only of small molecular building blocks. In this work, we show that, under realistic constraints, an abstract polymer model can exhibit dynamics such that attractors in the polymer population space with a higher average polymer length are also more probable. We generalize from the model and formalize the notions of complexity and evolution for chemical reaction networks with multiple attractors. The complexity of a species is defined as the minimum number of reactions needed to produce it from a set of building blocks, which in turn is used to define a measure of complexity for an attractor. A transition between attractors is considered to be a progressive evolution if the attractor with the higher probability also has a higher complexity. In an environment where only monomers are readily available, the attractor with a higher average polymer length is more complex. Thus, our abstract polymer model can exhibit progressive evolution for a range of thermodynamically plausible rate constants. We also formalize criteria for open-ended and historically-contingent evolution and explain the role of autocatalysis in obtaining them. Our work provides a basis for searching for prebiotically plausible scenarios in which long polymers can emerge and yield populations with even longer polymers.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary accumulation modelling in AMR: machine learning to infer and predict evolutionary dynamics of multi-drug resistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can we understand and predict the evolutionary pathways by which bacteria acquire multi-drug resistance (MDR)? These questions have substantial potential impact in basic biology and in applied approaches to address the global health challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we review how a class of machine learning approaches called evolutionary accumulation modelling (EvAM) may help reveal these dynamics using genetic and/or phenotypic AMR datasets, without requiring longitudinal sampling. These approaches are well-established in cancer progression and evolutionary biology, but currently less used in AMR research. We discuss how EvAM can learn the evolutionary pathways by which drug resistances and AMR features are acquired as pathogens evolve, predict next evolutionary steps, identify influences between AMR features, and explore differences in MDR evolution between regions, demographics, and more. We demonstrate a case study on MDR evolution in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, providing links to some approaches for implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between recombination and resampling is a significant challenge in mathematical population genetics and of great practical relevance. Asymptotic results about the distribution of samples when recombination is strong compared to resampling are often based on the approximate solution of certain recursions, which is technically hard and offers little conceptual insight. This work generalises an elegant probabilistic argument, based on the coupling of ancestral processes but so far only available in the case of two sites, to the multilocus setting. This offers an alternative route to, and slightly generalises, a classical result of Bhaskar and Song.</description>
