      <title>A Revised Density Estimate for the Largest Known Exoplanet, HAT-P-67 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-density ($\rho &lt; 0.1 \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$) hot Saturns are expected to quickly ($&lt;100$ Myr) lose their atmospheres due to stellar irradiation, explaining their rarity. HAT-P-67 b seems to be an exception, with $\rho &lt; 0.09 \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$ and maintaining its atmosphere to well after 1 Gyr. We present a photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of HAT-P-67 b to determine how it avoided mass loss. HAT-P-67 b orbits a $V=10.1$ evolved F-type star in a 4.81 day orbit. We present new radial velocity observations of the system from the NEID spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope from a follow-up campaign robust to stellar activity. We characterize the activity using photometry and activity indicators, revealing a stellar rotation period ($5.40\pm0.09$ d) near HAT-P-67 b's orbital period. We mitigate the stellar activity using a constrained quasi-periodic Gaussian process through a joint fit of archival ground-based photometry, TESS photometry, and our NEID observations, obtaining a planetary mass of $M_p = 0.45 \pm 0.15~M_{\rm J}$. Combined with a radius measurement of $R_p=2.140 \pm 0.025~R_{\rm J}$, this yields a density of $\rho_p = 0.061^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$, making HAT-P-67 b the second lowest-density hot giant known to date. We find the recent evolution of the host star caused mass loss for HAT-P-67 b to only recently occur. The planet will be tidally disrupted in $\sim 100-250$ Myr, shortly after losing its atmosphere. With rapid atmospheric mass loss, a large, helium leading tail, and upcoming observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, HAT-P-67 b is an exceptional target for future studies, for which an updated mass measurement provides important context.</description>

      <title>H2S ice sublimation dynamics: experimentally constrained binding energies, entrapment efficiencies, and snowlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is thought to be an important sulfur reservoir in interstellar ices. It serves as a key precursor to complex sulfur-bearing organics, and has been proposed to play a significant role in the origin of life. Although models and observations both suggest H2S to be present in ices in non-negligible amounts, its sublimation dynamics remain poorly constrained. In this work, we present a comprehensive experimental characterization of the sublimation behavior of H2S ice under astrophysically-relevant conditions. The sublimation behavior of H2S was monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) during temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. These experiments are used to determine binding energies and entrapment efficiencies of H2S, which are then employed to estimate its snowline positions in a protoplanetary disk midplane. We derive mean binding energies of 3159\pm46 K for pure H2S ice and 3392\pm56 K for submonolayer H2S desorbing from a compact amorphous solid water (cASW) surface. These values correspond to sublimation temperatures of around 64 K and 69 K in the disk midplane, placing its sublimation fronts at radii just interior to the CO2 snowline. We also investigate the entrapment of H2S in water ice and find it to be highly efficient, with ~75-85% of H2S remaining trapped past its sublimation temperature for H2O:H2S mixing ratios of ~5-17:1. We discuss potential mechanisms behind this efficient entrapment. Our findings imply that, in protoplanetary disks, H2S will mostly be retained in the ice phase until water crystallizes, at radii near the water snowline, if it forms mixed into water ice. This has significant implications for the possibility of H2S being incorporated into icy planetesimals and its potential delivery to terrestrial planets, which we discuss in detail.</description>

      <title>Ice sublimation in the dynamic HD 100453 disk reveals a rich reservoir of inherited complex organics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks around luminous young A-type stars are prime observational laboratories to determine the abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) present during planet formation. In contrast to their lower stellar mass counterparts, these warmer disks contain the sublimation fronts of complex molecules such as CH3OH on spatial scales accessible with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We present ALMA observations of the Herbig Ae disk HD 100453 that uncover a rich reservoir of COMs sublimating from the dust cavity edge. In addition to CH3OH, we detect 13CH3OH for the first time in a Class II disk, revealing a factor of three enhancement of 13C in the disk large organics. A tentative detection of CH2DOH is also reported, resulting in a D/H of 1-2%, which is consistent with the expected deuterium enhancement from the low temperature CH3OH formation in molecular clouds and with the deuteration of CH3OH measured in comets. The detection of methyl-formate (CH3OCHO), at only a few percent level of CH3OH is an order of magnitude lower compared to claims towards other organic-rich Herbig Ae disks but is more in line with organic abundance patterns towards the earlier stages of star formation. Together these data provide multiple lines of evidence that disks, and therefore the planet and comet-forming materials, contain inherited interstellar ices and perhaps the strongest evidence to date that much of the interstellar organic ice composition survives the early stages of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Out on a Limb: The Signatures of East-West Asymmetries in Transmission Spectra from General Circulation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of JWST, observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres are becoming increasingly precise. As a result, the signature of limb asymmetries due to temperature or abundance differences and the presence of aerosols can now be directly measured using transmission spectroscopy. Using a grid of general circulation models (GCMs) with varying irradiation temperature (1500 K - 4000 K) and prescriptions of cloud formation, we simulate 3D ingress/egress and morning/evening-limb transmission spectra. We aim to assess the impact that clouds, 3D temperature structure, and non-uniform distribution of gases have on the observed spectra, and how these inhomogeneities can be identified. A second goal is to assess the relative merits of two separate methods (ingress/egress v.s. morning/evening-limb spectroscopy) for isolating atmospheric asymmetries. From our models, it is evident that an east-west temperature difference is the leading order effect for producing ingress/egress or morning/evening-limb spectral differences. We additionally find that clouds contribute strongly to the observed limb asymmetry at moderate irradiation temperatures in our grid ($\sim 2000 \mathrm{K} &lt; T_{\mathrm{irr}} &lt; 3500 \mathrm{K}). At lower temperatures clouds equally dominate the optical depth on both limbs, while at higher temperatures the entire terminator region remains cloud-free. We develop limb asymmetry metrics that can be used to assess the degree of east-west asymmetry for a given planet and predict trends in these metrics with respect to irradiation temperature that are indicative of various physical processes. Our results are useful for predicting and diagnosing the signatures of limb asymmetries in JWST spectra.</description>

      <title>Refractory phosphorus in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phosphorus budget of planets is intertwined with their formation history and is thought to influence their habitability. The chemical reservoirs and volatile \emph{vs} refractory budget of phosphorus in planet-forming environments have so far eluded empirical characterisation. We employ high-resolution spectra from HST/STIS in the ultraviolet and APEX in the sub-mm to constrain the phosphorus budget in the well-characterized HD\,100546 star and protoplanetary disk system. We measure $\log{(P/H)_{\star}}=-7.50^{+0.23}_{-0.28}$ on the stellar surface, which traces the total inventory of P in accreting gas \emph{and }dust from the inner disk. The inner disk gas, inside of the main dust trap, has $\log{(P/H)_{\rm in}}\lesssim-8.70$, and the outer disk gas $\log{(P/H)_{\rm out}}\lesssim-9.30$. Phosphorus in the disk is carried by a relatively refractory reservoir, consistent with minerals such as apatite or schreibersite, or with ammonium phosphate salts, in terms of sublimation temperature. We discuss the impact this might have on the two protoplanets around HD\,100546. Our results contribute to our understanding of the chemical habitability of planetary systems and lay a foundation for future explorations, especially in the context of JWST and \emph{Ariel} which can study phosphorus in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on CN from exocomets transiting $\beta$ Pictoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young (23 Myr) nearby (19.4 pc) star $\beta$ Pictoris hosts an edge-on debris disk with two gas giant exoplanets in orbit around it. Many transient absorption features have been detected in the rotationally broadened stellar lines, which are thought to be the coma of infalling exocomets crossing the line of sight towards Earth. In the Solar System, the molecule cynaogen (CN) and its associated ionic species are one of the most detectable molecules in the coma and tails of comets.
  We perform a search for cyanogen in the spectra of $\beta$ Pictoris to detect or put an upper limit on this molecule's presence in a young, highly active planetary system. We divide twenty year's worth of HARPS spectra into those with strong exocomet absorption features, and those with only stellar lines. The high signal-to-noise stellar spectrum normalises out the stellar lines in the exocomet spectra, which are then shifted and stacked on the deepest exocomet absorption features to produce a high signal-to-noise exocomet spectrum, and search for the CN band head using a model temperature dependent cross-correlation template.
  We do not detect CN in our data, and place a temperature and broadening dependent 5$\sigma$ upper limit between 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, to be compared to the typical 10$^9$ - 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ expected from scaling of the values in the Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>The Ophiuchus DIsk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA): A Unified Evolutionary Sequence of Planet-Driven Substructures Explaining the Diversity of Disk Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of substructures in protoplanetary disks and their connection to planet formation is currently one of the main challenges in astrophysics. While some disks appear smooth, most exhibit diverse substructures such as gaps, rings, or inner cavities, with varying brightness and depth. As part of the Ophiuchus Disk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA), we previously proposed an evolutionary sequence to unify this diversity, driven by the formation of giant planets through core accretion and subsequent planet-disk interactions. By combining the disk evolution and planet formation code PLANETALP with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, we have now reproduced the key aspects of the proposed evolutionary sequence. Starting with a smooth disk (like e.g., WLY 2-63), we modeled the evolution of a fiducial disk with a 1 Jupiter-mass planet at 57 au. Within a few hundreds of orbits, a narrow gap forms, resembling ISO-Oph 17. By $\sim$0.1 Myr, the gap widens, and dust accumulates at the cavity edge, producing a structure similar to Elias 2-24. At $\sim$0.4 Myr, the disk evolves further into a morphology akin to DoAr 44, characterized by a smaller inner disk and a brighter inner rim. By $\sim$1 Myr, the system transitions to a single narrow ring, resembling RXJ1633.9-2442. This line of work strongly supports the planetary origin of substructures and enables the possibility of identifying a population of planets that is currently beyond the reach of more direct detection techniques.</description>

      <title>A Short History of (Orbital) Decay: Roman's Prospects for Detecting Dying Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~10^5 transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, Q^{'}_{*}, of 10^6, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3} and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional half-moment multigroup radiative transfer. Improving moment-based thermal models of circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of vertical inward and outward fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we aim to remove the interaction between beams in a fixed spatial direction by introducing a half-moment (HM) closure, which integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres. We derive a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replace it with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implement the HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We test these methods in numerical benchmarks, including computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing the results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The resulting HM closure tends to the correct limit in the diffusion regime and prevents interactions between crossing fluxes in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations with 22 frequency groups, the M1 closure disagrees with the MC midplane temperature by up to 21%, while HM reduces this discrepancy to 6%. Even with just 3 frequency groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%.</description>

      <title>Detection of H2O and CO2 in the Atmosphere of the Hot Super-Neptune WASP-166b with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the atmosphere of the hot super-Neptune WASP-166b ($P = 5.44$ d, $R_p = 6.9 \pm 0.3$ R$_\oplus$, $M_p = 32.1 \pm 1.6$ M$_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 1270 \pm 30$ K) orbiting an F9V star using JWST transmission spectroscopy with NIRISS and NIRSpec ($0.85-5.17$ $\mu$m). With this broad wavelength range, NIRISS provides strong constraints on H$_2$O and clouds (where NIRSpec performs poorly) while NIRSpec captures CO$_2$ and NH$_3$ (where NIRISS performs poorly). Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\sigma$) for the first time. We also find a possible hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\sigma$). Finally, we report inconclusive support for the presence of SO$_2$, CO, and Na, as well as non-detections of CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, H$_2$S, and K. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON equilibrium chemistry retrievals a superstellar planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and planetary C/O ratio ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) consistent with the stellar C/O ratio ($C/O_* = 0.41 \pm 0.08$). These results are compatible with various planetary formation pathways, especially those that include planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation. WASP-166b also resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, these results and further atmospheric observations of Hot Neptunes will help determine the driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form $\delta V=\frac{\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations were carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Detecting Signs of Life on Exoplanets in the JWST Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for signs of life in the Universe has entered a new phase with the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Detecting biosignature gases via exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy is in principle within JWST's reach. We reflect on JWST's early results in the context of the potential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us with a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed spectra-already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate 3D atmospheric processes-can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST's quality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST is an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive "silver bullet" biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow "parallel interpretations" that will perhaps not be resolved until the next generation of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone planet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may continue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature gas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse methods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances and constraining the atmosphere context. Looking ahead, future telescopes and innovative observational strategies will be essential for the reliable detection of biosignature gases.</description>

Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore their effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of H$_2$ and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continuous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. We estimate the alignment degree of SPEs from superparmagnetic (SPM) grains and find that it is only significant for SPM grains having large iron clusters and fast rotation. We suggest that low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned superparamagnetic grains with large iron inclusions induced by CRs might cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light.</description>
