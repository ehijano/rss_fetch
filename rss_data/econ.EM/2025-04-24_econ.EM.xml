      <title>Multicell experiments for marginal treatment effect estimation of digital ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized experiments with treatment and control groups are an important tool to measure the impacts of interventions. However, in experimental settings with one-sided noncompliance extant empirical approaches may not produce the estimands a decision maker needs to solve the problem of interest. For example, these experimental designs are common in digital advertising settings but typical methods do not yield effects that inform the intensive margin: how many consumers should be reached or how much should be spent on a campaign. We propose a solution that combines a novel multicell experimental design with modern estimation techniques that enables decision makers to solve problems with an intensive margin. Our design is straightforward to implement and does not require additional budget. We illustrate our method through simulations calibrated using an advertising experiment at Facebook, demonstrating its superior performance in various scenarios and its advantage over direct optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast and simple inner-loop algorithms of static / dynamic BLP estimations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04494v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates computationally efficient inner-loop algorithms for estimating static/dynamic BLP models. It provides the following ideas for reducing the number of inner-loop iterations: (1). Add a term relating to the outside option share in the BLP contraction mapping; (2). Analytically represent the mean product utilities as a function of value functions and solve for value functions (for dynamic BLP); (3). Combine an acceleration method of fixed-point iterations, especially the Anderson acceleration. They are independent and easy to implement. This study shows the good performance of these methods using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Prediction Sets and Conformal Inference with Interval Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given data on a scalar random variable $Y$, a prediction set for $Y$ with miscoverage level $\alpha$ is a set of values for $Y$ that contains a randomly drawn $Y$ with probability $1 - \alpha$, where $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Among all prediction sets that satisfy this coverage property, the oracle prediction set is the one with the smallest volume. This paper provides estimation methods of such prediction sets given observed conditioning covariates when $Y$ is \textit{censored} or \textit{measured in intervals}. We first characterise the oracle prediction set under interval censoring and develop a consistent estimator for the shortest prediction {\it interval} that satisfies this coverage property.These consistency results are extended to accommodate cases where the prediction set consists of multiple disjoint intervals. We use conformal inference to construct a prediction set that achieves finite-sample validity under censoring and maintains consistency as sample size increases, using a conformity score function designed for interval data. The procedure accommodates the prediction uncertainty that is irreducible (due to the stochastic nature of outcomes), the modelling uncertainty due to partial identification and also sampling uncertainty that gets reduced as samples get larger. We conduct a set of Monte Carlo simulations and an application to data from the Current Population Survey. The results highlight the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A sliced Wasserstein and diffusion approach to random coefficient models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new minimum-distance estimator for linear random coefficient models. This estimator integrates the recently advanced sliced Wasserstein distance with the nearest neighbor methods, both of which enhance computational efficiency. We demonstrate that the proposed method is consistent in approximating the true distribution. Moreover, our formulation naturally leads to a diffusion process-based algorithm and is closely connected to treatment effect distribution estimation -- both of which are of independent interest and hold promise for broader applications.</description>
