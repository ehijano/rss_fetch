      <title>Verification of Neural Control Barrier Functions with Symbolic Derivative Bounds Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are important in safety-critical systems and robot control applications. Neural networks have been used to parameterize and synthesize CBFs with bounded control input for complex systems. However, it is still challenging to verify pre-trained neural networks CBFs (neural CBFs) in an efficient symbolic manner. To this end, we propose a new efficient verification framework for ReLU-based neural CBFs through symbolic derivative bound propagation by combining the linearly bounded nonlinear dynamic system and the gradient bounds of neural CBFs. Specifically, with Heaviside step function form for derivatives of activation functions, we show that the symbolic bounds can be propagated through the inner product of neural CBF Jacobian and nonlinear system dynamics. Through extensive experiments on different robot dynamics, our results outperform the interval arithmetic based baselines in verified rate and verification time along the CBF boundary, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method with different model complexity.

      <title>Magnetic Ball Chain Robots for Cardiac Arrhythmia Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel magnetic navigation system for cardiac ablation. The system is formed from two key elements: a magnetic ablation catheter consisting of a chain of spherical permanent magnets; and an actuation system comprised of two cart-mounted permanent magnets undergoing pure rotation. The catheter design enables a large magnetic content with the goal of minimizing the footprint of the actuation system for easier integration with the clinical workflow. We present a quasi-static model of the catheter, the design of the actuation units, and their control modalities. Experimental validation shows that we can use small rotating magnets (119mm diameter) to reach cardiac ablation targets while generating clinically-relevant forces. Catheter control using a joystick is compared with manual catheter control. blue While total task completion time is similar, smoother navigation is observed using the proposed robotic system. We also demonstrate that the ball chain can ablate heart tissue and generate lesions comparable to the current clinical ablation catheters.</description>

      <title>Integrating Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Models for Autonomous Robotics: Methods and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), large deep learning models pre-trained on vast, unlabeled datasets, exhibit powerful capabilities in understanding complex patterns and generating sophisticated outputs. However, they often struggle to adapt to specific tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn through interaction and feedback, offers a compelling solution. Integrating RL with FMs enables these models to achieve desired outcomes and excel at particular tasks. Additionally, RL can be enhanced by leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of FMs. This synergy is revolutionizing various fields, including robotics. FMs, rich in knowledge and generalization, provide robots with valuable information, while RL facilitates learning and adaptation through real-world interactions.
  This survey paper comprehensively explores this exciting intersection, examining how these paradigms can be integrated to advance robotic intelligence. We analyze the use of foundation models as action planners, the development of robotics-specific foundation models, and the mutual benefits of combining FMs with RL. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of integration approaches, including large language models, vision-language models, diffusion models, and transformer-based RL models. We also explore how RL can utilize world representations learned from FMs to enhance robotic task execution.
  Our survey aims to synthesize current research and highlight key challenges in robotic reasoning and control, particularly in the context of integrating FMs and RL--two rapidly evolving technologies. By doing so, we seek to spark future research and emphasize critical areas that require further investigation to enhance robotics. We provide an updated collection of papers based on our taxonomy, accessible on our open-source project website at: https://github.com/clmoro/Robotics-RL-FMs-Integration.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization of Central Pattern Generators for Quadruped Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical legged locomotion controllers are designed or trained offline. This is in contrast to many animals, which are able to locomote at birth, and rapidly improve their locomotion skills with few real-world interactions. Such motor control is possible through oscillatory neural networks located in the spinal cord of vertebrates, known as Central Pattern Generators (CPGs). Models of the CPG have been widely used to generate locomotion skills in robotics, but can require extensive hand-tuning or offline optimization of inter-connected parameters with genetic algorithms. In this paper, we present a framework for the \textit{online} optimization of the CPG parameters through Bayesian Optimization. We show that our framework can rapidly optimize and adapt to varying velocity commands and changes in the terrain, for example to varying coefficients of friction, terrain slope angles, and added mass payloads placed on the robot. We study the effects of sensory feedback on the CPG, and find that both force feedback in the phase equations, as well as posture control (Virtual Model Control) are both beneficial for robot stability and energy efficiency. In hardware experiments on the Unitree Go1, we show rapid optimization (in under 3 minutes) and adaptation of energy-efficient gaits to varying target velocities in a variety of scenarios: varying coefficients of friction, added payloads up to 15 kg, and variable slopes up to 10 degrees.

      <title>Agent-Based Emulation for Deploying Robot Swarm Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant research, robotic swarms have yet to be useful in solving real-world problems, largely due to the difficulty of creating and controlling swarming behaviors in multi-agent systems. Traditional top-down approaches in which a desired emergent behavior is produced often require complex, resource-heavy robots, limiting their practicality. This paper introduces a bottom-up approach by employing an Embodied Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation approach, emphasizing the use of simple robots and identifying conditions that naturally lead to self-organized collective behaviors. Using the Reality-to-Simulation-to-Reality for Swarms (RSRS) process, we tightly integrate real-world experiments with simulations to reproduce known swarm behaviors as well as discovering a novel emergent behavior without aiming to eliminate or even reduce the sim2real gap. This paper presents the development of an Agent-Based Embodiment and Emulation process that balances the importance of running physical swarming experiments and the prohibitively time-consuming process of even setting up and running a single experiment with 20+ robots by leveraging low-fidelity lightweight simulations to enable hypothesis-formation to guide physical experiments. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods by emulating two known behaviors from the literature and show a third behavior `discovered' by accident.</description>

      <title>Automated Planning Domain Inference for Task and Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task and motion planning (TAMP) frameworks address long and complex planning problems by integrating high-level task planners with low-level motion planners. However, existing TAMP methods rely heavily on the manual design of planning domains that specify the preconditions and postconditions of all high-level actions. This paper proposes a method to automate planning domain inference from a handful of test-time trajectory demonstrations, reducing the reliance on human design. Our approach incorporates a deep learning-based estimator that predicts the appropriate components of a domain for a new task and a search algorithm that refines this prediction, reducing the size and ensuring the utility of the inferred domain. Our method is able to generate new domains from minimal demonstrations at test time, enabling robots to handle complex tasks more efficiently. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms behavior cloning baselines, which directly imitate planner behavior, in terms of planning performance and generalization across a variety of tasks. Additionally, our method reduces computational costs and data amount requirements at test time for inferring new planning domains.</description>

      <title>Caging in Time: A Framework for Robust Object Manipulation under Uncertainties and Limited Robot Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world object manipulation has been commonly challenged by physical uncertainties and perception limitations. Being an effective strategy, while caging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided robust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict requirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed contacts, or specific geometries of the robots or the objects. To this end, this work proposes a novel concept, termed Caging in Time, to allow caging configurations to be formed even if there is just one robot engaged in a task. This novel concept can be explained by an insight that even if a caging configuration is needed to constrain the motion of an object, only a small portion of the cage is actively manipulating at a time. As such, we can switch the configuration of the robot strategically so that by collapsing its configuration in time, we will see a cage formed and its necessary portion active whenever needed. We instantiate our Caging in Time theory on challenging quasistatic and dynamic manipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be achieved in general state spaces including geometry-based and energy-based spaces. With extensive experiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation, in an open-loop manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the object geometry or physical properties, nor realtime accurate feedback on the manipulation states. In addition to being an effective and robust open-loop manipulation solution, the proposed theory can be a supplementary strategy to other manipulation systems affected by uncertain or limited robot perception.</description>

      <title>Implicit Contact Diffuser: Sequential Contact Reasoning with Latent Point Cloud Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich manipulation has long been a challenging problem, as it requires reasoning over both discrete contact modes and continuous object motion. We introduce Implicit Contact Diffuser (ICD), a diffusion-based model that generates a sequence of neural descriptors that specify a series of contact relationships between the object and the environment. This sequence is then used as guidance for an MPC method to accomplish a given task. The key advantage of this approach is that the latent descriptors provide more task-relevant guidance to MPC, helping to avoid local minima for contact-rich manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that ICD outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as cable routing and notebook folding. Additionally, our experiments also indicate that \methodshort can generalize a target contact relationship to a different environment. More visualizations can be found on our website $\href{https://implicit-contact-diffuser.github.io/}{https://implicit-contact-diffuser.github.io}$</description>

      <title>Cycloidal Quasi-Direct Drive Actuator Designs with Learning-based Torque Estimation for Legged Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach through the design and implementation of Cycloidal Quasi-Direct Drive actuators for legged robotics. The cycloidal gear mechanism, with its inherent high torque density and mechanical robustness, offers significant advantages over conventional designs. By integrating cycloidal gears into the Quasi-Direct Drive framework, we aim to enhance the performance of legged robots, particularly in tasks demanding high torque and dynamic loads, while still keeping them lightweight. Additionally, we develop a torque estimation framework for the actuator using an Actuator Network, which effectively reduces the sim-to-real gap introduced by the cycloidal drive's complex dynamics. This integration is crucial for capturing the complex dynamics of a cycloidal drive, which contributes to improved learning efficiency, agility, and adaptability for reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>EnKode: Active Learning of Unknown Flows with Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we address the task of adaptive sampling to model vector fields. When modeling environmental phenomena with a robot, gathering high resolution information can be resource intensive. Actively gathering data and modeling flows with the data is a more efficient alternative. However, in such scenarios, data is often sparse and thus requires flow modeling techniques that are effective at capturing the relevant dynamical features of the flow to ensure high prediction accuracy of the resulting models. To accomplish this effectively, regions with high informative value must be identified. We propose EnKode, an active sampling approach based on Koopman Operator theory and ensemble methods that can build high quality flow models and effectively estimate model uncertainty. For modeling complex flows, EnKode provides comparable or better estimates of unsampled flow regions than Gaussian Process Regression models with hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, our active sensing scheme provides more accurate flow estimates than comparable strategies that rely on uniform sampling. We evaluate EnKode using three common benchmarking systems: the Bickley Jet, Lid-Driven Cavity flow with an obstacle, and real ocean currents from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</description>

      <title>MotionGlot: A Multi-Embodied Motion Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MotionGlot, a model that can generate motion across multiple embodiments with different action dimensions, such as quadruped robots and human bodies. By leveraging the well-established training procedures commonly used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce an instruction-tuning template specifically designed for motion-related tasks. Our approach demonstrates that the principles underlying LLM training can be successfully adapted to learn a wide range of motion generation tasks across multiple embodiments with different action dimensions. We demonstrate the various abilities of MotionGlot on a set of 6 tasks and report an average improvement of 35.3% across tasks. Additionally, we contribute two new datasets: (1) a dataset of expert-controlled quadruped locomotion with approximately 48,000 trajectories paired with direction-based text annotations, and (2) a dataset of over 23,000 situational text prompts for human motion generation tasks. Finally, we conduct hardware experiments to validate the capabilities of our system in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Smoothness and Reducing High-Frequency Oscillations in Continuous Control Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies are prone to high-frequency oscillations, especially undesirable when deploying to hardware in the real-world. In this paper, we identify, categorize, and compare methods from the literature that aim to mitigate high-frequency oscillations in deep RL. We define two broad classes: loss regularization and architectural methods. At their core, these methods incentivize learning a smooth mapping, such that nearby states in the input space produce nearby actions in the output space. We present benchmarks in terms of policy performance and control smoothness on traditional RL environments from the Gymnasium and a complex manipulation task, as well as three robotics locomotion tasks that include deployment and evaluation with real-world hardware. Finally, we also propose hybrid methods that combine elements from both loss regularization and architectural methods. We find that the best-performing hybrid outperforms other methods, and improves control smoothness by 26.8% over the baseline, with a worst-case performance degradation of just 2.8%.</description>

      <title>QuasiNav: Asymmetric Cost-Aware Navigation Planning with Constrained Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured outdoor environments is inherently challenging due to the presence of asymmetric traversal costs, such as varying energy expenditures for uphill versus downhill movement. Traditional reinforcement learning methods often assume symmetric costs, which can lead to suboptimal navigation paths and increased safety risks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce QuasiNav, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates quasimetric embeddings to explicitly model asymmetric costs and guide efficient, safe navigation. QuasiNav formulates the navigation problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and employs quasimetric embeddings to capture directionally dependent costs, allowing for a more accurate representation of the terrain. This approach is combined with adaptive constraint tightening within a constrained policy optimization framework to dynamically enforce safety constraints during learning. We validate QuasiNav across three challenging navigation scenarios-undulating terrains, asymmetric hill traversal, and directionally dependent terrain traversal-demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results show that QuasiNav significantly outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher success rates, improved energy efficiency, and better adherence to safety constraints.</description>

      <title>SERN: Simulation-Enhanced Realistic Navigation for Multi-Agent Robotic Systems in Contested Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of autonomous systems in complex environments necessitates efficient communication and task completion among multiple agents. This paper presents SERN (Simulation-Enhanced Realistic Navigation), a novel framework integrating virtual and physical environments for real-time collaborative decision-making in multi-robot systems. SERN addresses key challenges in asset deployment and coordination through a bi-directional communication framework using the AuroraXR ROS Bridge. Our approach advances the SOTA through accurate real-world representation in virtual environments using Unity high-fidelity simulator; synchronization of physical and virtual robot movements; efficient ROS data distribution between remote locations; and integration of SOTA semantic segmentation for enhanced environmental perception. Our evaluations show a 15% to 24% improvement in latency and up to a 15% increase in processing efficiency compared to traditional ROS setups. Real-world and virtual simulation experiments with multiple robots demonstrate synchronization accuracy, achieving less than 5 cm positional error and under 2-degree rotational error. These results highlight SERN's potential to enhance situational awareness and multi-agent coordination in diverse, contested environments.</description>

      <title>DARE: Diffusion Policy for Autonomous Robot Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration requires a robot to efficiently explore and map unknown environments. Compared to conventional methods that can only optimize paths based on the current robot belief, learning-based methods show the potential to achieve improved performance by drawing on past experiences to reason about unknown areas. In this paper, we propose DARE, a novel generative approach that leverages diffusion models trained on expert demonstrations, which can explicitly generate an exploration path through one-time inference. We build DARE upon an attention-based encoder and a diffusion policy model, and introduce ground truth optimal demonstrations for training to learn better patterns for exploration. The trained planner can reason about the partial belief to recognize the potential structure in unknown areas and consider these areas during path planning. Our experiments demonstrate that DARE achieves on-par performance with both conventional and learning-based state-of-the-art exploration planners, as well as good generalizability in both simulations and real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>DiffusionSeeder: Seeding Motion Optimization with Diffusion for Rapid Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running optimization across many parallel seeds leveraging GPU compute have relaxed the need for a good initialization, but this can fail if the problem is highly non-convex as all seeds could get stuck in local minima. One such setting is collision-free motion optimization for robot manipulation, where optimization converges quickly on easy problems but struggle in obstacle dense environments (e.g., a cluttered cabinet or table). In these situations, graph-based planning algorithms are used to obtain seeds, resulting in significant slowdowns. We propose DiffusionSeeder, a diffusion based approach that generates trajectories to seed motion optimization for rapid robot motion planning. DiffusionSeeder takes the initial depth image observation of the scene and generates high quality, multi-modal trajectories that are then fine-tuned with a few iterations of motion optimization. We integrate DiffusionSeeder to generate the seed trajectories for cuRobo, a GPU-accelerated motion optimization method, which results in 12x speed up on average, and 36x speed up for more complicated problems, while achieving 10% higher success rate in partially observed simulation environments. Our results show the effectiveness of using diverse solutions from a learned diffusion model. Physical experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate the sim2real transfer of DiffusionSeeder to the real robot, with an average success rate of 86% and planning time of 26ms, improving on cuRobo by 51% higher success rate while also being 2.5x faster.</description>

      <title>Fast State-of-Health Estimation Method for Lithium-ion Battery using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are utilized as a major energy source in various fields because of their high energy density and long lifespan. During repeated charging and discharging, the degradation of LIBs, which reduces their maximum power output and operating time, is a pivotal issue. This degradation can affect not only battery performance but also safety of the system. Therefore, it is essential to accurately estimate the state-of-health (SOH) of the battery in real time. To address this problem, we propose a fast SOH estimation method that utilizes the sparse model identification algorithm (SINDy) for nonlinear dynamics. SINDy can discover the governing equations of target systems with low data assuming that few functions have the dominant characteristic of the system. To decide the state of degradation model, correlation analysis is suggested. Using SINDy and correlation analysis, we can obtain the data-driven SOH model to improve the interpretability of the system. To validate the feasibility of the proposed method, the estimation performance of the SOH and the computation time are evaluated by comparing it with various machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep-Sea A*+: An Advanced Path Planning Method Integrating Enhanced A* and Dynamic Window Approach for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As terrestrial resources become increasingly depleted, the demand for deep-sea resource exploration has intensified. However, the extreme conditions in the deep-sea environment pose significant challenges for underwater operations, necessitating the development of robust detection robots. In this paper, we propose an advanced path planning methodology that integrates an improved A* algorithm with the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA). By optimizing the search direction of the traditional A* algorithm and introducing an enhanced evaluation function, our improved A* algorithm accelerates path searching and reduces computational load. Additionally, the path-smoothing process has been refined to improve continuity and smoothness, minimizing sharp turns. This method also integrates global path planning with local dynamic obstacle avoidance via DWA, improving the real-time response of underwater robots in dynamic environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the traditional A* algorithm in terms of path smoothness, obstacle avoidance, and real-time performance. The robustness of this approach in complex environments with both static and dynamic obstacles highlights its potential in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <title>Combining Ontological Knowledge and Large Language Model for User-Friendly Service Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifestyle support through robotics is an increasingly promising field, with expectations for robots to take over or assist with chores like floor cleaning, table setting and clearing, and fetching items. The growth of AI, particularly foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs), is significantly shaping this sector. LLMs, by facilitating natural interactions and providing vast general knowledge, are proving invaluable for robotic tasks. This paper zeroes in on the benefits of LLMs for "bring-me" tasks, where robots fetch specific items for users, often based on vague instructions. Our previous efforts utilized an ontology extended to handle environmental data to decipher such vagueness, but faced limitations when unresolvable ambiguities required user intervention for clarity. Here, we enhance our approach by integrating LLMs for providing additional commonsense knowledge, pairing it with ontological data to mitigate the issue of hallucinations and reduce the need for user queries, thus improving system usability. We present a system that merges these knowledge bases and assess its efficacy on "bring-me" tasks, aiming to provide a more seamless and efficient robotic assistance experience.</description>

      <title>Guiding Reinforcement Learning with Incomplete System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is inherently a reactive method, operating under the assumption that it starts with no prior knowledge of the system and entirely depends on trial-and-error for learning. This approach faces several challenges, such as poor sample efficiency, generalization, and the need for well-designed reward functions to guide learning effectively. On the other hand, controllers based on complete system dynamics do not require data. This paper addresses the intermediate situation where there is not enough model information for complete controller design, but there is enough to suggest that a model-free approach is not the best approach either. By carefully decoupling known and unknown information about the system dynamics, we obtain an embedded controller guided by our partial model and thus improve the learning efficiency of an RL-enhanced approach. A modular design allows us to deploy mainstream RL algorithms to refine the policy. Simulation results show that our method significantly improves sample efficiency compared with standard RL methods on continuous control tasks, and also offers enhanced performance over traditional control approaches. Experiments on a real ground vehicle also validate the performance of our method, including generalization and robustness.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian motion prediction evaluation for urban autonomous driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian motion prediction is a key part of the modular-based autonomous driving pipeline, ensuring safe, accurate, and timely awareness of human agents' possible future trajectories. The autonomous vehicle can use this information to prevent any possible accidents and create a comfortable and pleasant driving experience for the passengers and pedestrians. A wealth of research was done on the topic from the authors of robotics, computer vision, intelligent transportation systems, and other fields. However, a relatively unexplored angle is the integration of the state-of-art solutions into existing autonomous driving stacks and evaluating them in real-life conditions rather than sanitized datasets. We analyze selected publications with provided open-source solutions and provide a perspective obtained by integrating them into existing Autonomous Driving framework - Autoware Mini and performing experiments in natural urban conditions in Tartu, Estonia to determine valuability of traditional motion prediction metrics. This perspective should be valuable to any potential autonomous driving or robotics engineer looking for the real-world performance of the existing state-of-art pedestrian motion prediction problem. The code with instructions on accessing the dataset is available at https://github.com/dmytrozabolotnii/autoware_mini.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Responsibility During the Usage of AI-Based Exoskeletons for Upper Limb Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ethical issues concerning the AI-based exoskeletons used in healthcare have already been studied literally rather than technically. How the ethical guidelines can be integrated into the development process has not been widely studied. However, this is one of the most important topics which should be studied more in real-life applications. Therefore, in this paper we highlight one ethical concern in the context of an exoskeleton used to train a user to perform a gesture: during the interaction between the exoskeleton, patient and therapist, how is the responsibility for decision making distributed? Based on the outcome of this, we will discuss how to integrate ethical guidelines into the development process of an AI-based exoskeleton. The discussion is based on a case study: AiBle. The different technical factors affecting the rehabilitation results and the human-machine interaction for AI-based exoskeletons are identified and discussed in this paper in order to better apply the ethical guidelines during the development of AI-based exoskeletons.</description>

      <title>EnvBridge: Bridging Diverse Environments with Cross-Environment Knowledge Transfer for Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Direction-Constrained Control for Efficient Physical Human-Robot Interaction under Hierarchical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control method to address the physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) challenge in the context of hierarchical tasks. A common approach to managing hierarchical tasks is Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP), which, however, cannot be directly applied to human interaction due to its allowance of arbitrary velocity direction adjustments. To resolve this limitation, we introduce the concept of directional constraints and develop a direction-constrained optimization algorithm to handle the nonlinearities induced by these constraints. The algorithm solves two sub-problems, minimizing the error and minimizing the deviation angle, in parallel, and combines the results of the two sub-problems to produce a final optimal outcome. The mutual influence between these two sub-problems is analyzed to determine the best parameter for combination. Additionally, the velocity objective in our control framework is computed using a variable admittance controller. Traditional admittance control does not account for constraints. To address this issue, we propose a variable admittance control method to adjust control objectives dynamically. The method helps reduce the deviation between robot velocity and human intention at the constraint boundaries, thereby enhancing interaction efficiency. We evaluate the proposed method in scenarios where a human operator physically interacts with a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. The results highlight the importance of incorporating directional constraints in pHRI for hierarchical tasks. Compared to existing methods, our approach generates smoother robotic trajectories during interaction while avoiding interaction delays at the constraint boundaries.</description>

      <title>FlightAR: AR Flight Assistance Interface with Multiple Video Streams and Object Detection Aimed at Immersive Drone Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The swift advancement of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies necessitates new standards for developing human-drone interaction (HDI) interfaces. Most interfaces for HDI, especially first-person view (FPV) goggles, limit the operator's ability to obtain information from the environment. This paper presents a novel interface, FlightAR, that integrates augmented reality (AR) overlays of UAV first-person view (FPV) and bottom camera feeds with head-mounted display (HMD) to enhance the pilot's situational awareness. Using FlightAR, the system provides pilots not only with a video stream from several UAV cameras simultaneously, but also the ability to observe their surroundings in real time. User evaluation with NASA-TLX and UEQ surveys showed low physical demand ($\mu=1.8$, $SD = 0.8$) and good performance ($\mu=3.4$, $SD = 0.8$), proving better user assessments in comparison with baseline FPV goggles. Participants also rated the system highly for stimulation ($\mu=2.35$, $SD = 0.9$), novelty ($\mu=2.1$, $SD = 0.9$) and attractiveness ($\mu=1.97$, $SD = 1$), indicating positive user experiences. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to improve UAV piloting experience through enhanced situational awareness and intuitive control.

      <description>arXiv:2410.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning, which enables robots to learn behaviors from demonstrations by non-experts, has emerged as a promising solution for generating robot motions in such environments. The imitation learning based robot motion generation method, however, has the drawback of being limited by the demonstrators task execution speed. This paper presents a novel temporal ensemble approach applied to imitation learning algorithms, allowing for execution of future actions. The proposed method leverages existing demonstration data and pretrained policies, offering the advantages of requiring no additional computation and being easy to implement. The algorithms performance was validated through real world experiments involving robotic block color sorting, demonstrating up to 3x increase in task execution speed while maintaining a high success rate compared to the action chunking with transformer method. This study highlights the potential for significantly improving the performance of imitation learning-based policies, which were previously limited by the demonstrator's speed. It is expected to contribute substantially to future advancements in autonomous object manipulation technologies aimed at enhancing productivity.</description>

      <title>Magneto-oscillatory localization for small-scale robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism is widely used for the wireless localization and actuation of robots and devices for medical procedures. However, current static magnetic localization methods suffer from large required magnets and are limited to only five degrees of freedom due to a fundamental constraint of the rotational symmetry around the magnetic axis. We present the small-scale magneto-oscillatory localization (SMOL) method, which is capable of wirelessly localizing a millimeter-scale tracker with full six degrees of freedom in deep biological tissues. The SMOL device uses the temporal oscillation of a mechanically resonant cantilever with a magnetic dipole to break the rotational symmetry, and exploits the frequency-response to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio with sub-millimeter accuracy over a large distance of up to 12 centimeters and quasi-continuous refresh rates up to 200 Hz. Integration into real-time closed-loop controlled robots and minimally-invasive surgical tools are demonstrated to reveal the vast potential of the SMOL method.</description>

      <title>Miniature magneto-oscillatory wireless sensor for magnetic field and gradient measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-oscillatory devices have been recently developed as very potent wireless miniature position trackers and sensors with an exceptional accuracy and sensing distance for surgical and robotic applications. However, it is still unclear to which extend a mechanically resonating sub-millimeter magnet interacts with external magnetic fields or gradients, which induce frequency shifts of sub-mHz to several Hz and therefore affect the sensing accuracy. Here, we investigate this effect experimentally on a cantilever-based magneto-oscillatory wireless sensor (MOWS) and build an analytical model concerning magnetic and mechanical interactions. The millimeter-scale MOWS is capable to detect magnetic fields with sub-uT resolution to at least +/- 5 mT, and simultaneously detects magnetic field gradients with a resolution of 65 uT/m to at least +/- 50 mT/m. The magnetic field sensitivity allows direct calculation of mechanical device properties, and by rotation, individual contributions of the magnetic field and gradient can be analyzed. The derived model is general and can be applied to other magneto-oscillatory systems interacting with magnetic environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GS-LIVM, a real-time photo-realistic LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping framework with Gaussian Splatting tailored for outdoor scenes. Compared to existing methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our approach enables real-time photo-realistic mapping while ensuring high-quality image rendering in large-scale unbounded outdoor environments. In this work, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is employed to mitigate the issues resulting from sparse and unevenly distributed LiDAR observations. The voxel-based 3D Gaussians map representation facilitates real-time dense mapping in large outdoor environments with acceleration governed by custom CUDA kernels. Moreover, the overall framework is designed in a covariance-centered manner, where the estimated covariance is used to initialize the scale and rotation of 3D Gaussians, as well as update the parameters of the GPR. We evaluate our algorithm on several outdoor datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mapping efficiency and rendering quality.

      <title>Layered LA-MAPF: a decomposition of large agent MAPF instance to accelerate solving without compromising solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has been widely studied in recent years. However, most existing MAPF algorithms assume that an agent occupies only a single grid in a grid-based map. This assumption limits their applicability in many real-world domains where agents have geometric shapes, rather than being point-like. Such agents, which can occupy multiple cells simultaneously, are referred to as ``large'' agents. When considering the shape and size of agents in MAPF, the computational complexity increases significantly as the number of agents grows, primarily due to the increased overhead in conflict detection between geometric agents. In this paper, we propose two types of subproblems for the LA-MAPF (Large-Agent MAPF) problem: \textbf{cluster} (which has no constraints on the order of solution) and \textbf{level} (which imposes constraints on the solution order). We introduce \textbf{Layered LA-MAPF}, a method that decomposes a MAPF instance involving geometric agents into clusters, and then further decomposes each cluster into levels. This approach aims to reduce time complexity when solving LA-MAPF problems. Our results demonstrate the performance of our method as the number of agents increases across various maps, and how it accelerates LA-MAPF methods, such as LA-CBS and LA-LaCAM. Experiments show that our LA-MAPF method with instance decomposition \textbf{halves the time cost (reducing from an average of 40s to 20s) and triples the success rate (from an average of 0.27 to 0.80)} in finding a solution within 60 seconds. To facilitate further research, we have made the source code for Layered LA-MAPF publicly available at \url{https://github.com/JoeYao-bit/LayeredMAPF/algorithm/LA-MAPF}.</description>

      <title>Towards Map-Agnostic Policies for Adaptive Informative Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots are frequently tasked to gather relevant sensor data in unknown terrains. A key challenge for classical path planning algorithms used for autonomous information gathering is adaptively replanning paths online as the terrain is explored given limited onboard compute resources. Recently, learning-based approaches emerged that train planning policies offline and enable computationally efficient online replanning performing policy inference. These approaches are designed and trained for terrain monitoring missions assuming a single specific map representation, which limits their applicability to different terrains. To address these issues, we propose a novel formulation of the adaptive informative path planning problem unified across different map representations, enabling training and deploying planning policies in a larger variety of monitoring missions. Experimental results validate that our novel formulation easily integrates with classical non-learning-based planning approaches while maintaining their performance. Our trained planning policy performs similarly to state-of-the-art map-specifically trained policies. We validate our learned policy on unseen real-world terrain datasets.</description>

      <title>Impact of 3D LiDAR Resolution in Graph-based SLAM Approaches: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a key component of autonomous systems operating in environments that require a consistent map for reliable localization. SLAM has been a widely studied topic for decades with most of the solutions being camera or LiDAR based. Early LiDAR-based approaches primarily relied on 2D data, whereas more recent frameworks use 3D data. In this work, we survey recent 3D LiDAR-based Graph-SLAM methods in urban environments, aiming to compare their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. Additionally, we evaluate their robustness regarding the LiDAR resolution namely 64 $vs$ 128 channels. Regarding SLAM methods, we evaluate SC-LeGO-LOAM, SC-LIO-SAM, Cartographer, and HDL-Graph on real-world urban environments using the KITTI odometry dataset (a LiDAR with 64-channels only) and a new dataset (AUTONOMOS-LABS). The latter dataset, collected using instrumented vehicles driving in Berlin suburban area, comprises both 64 and 128 LiDARs. The experimental results are reported in terms of quantitative `metrics' and complemented by qualitative maps.</description>

      <title>Risk-Averse Model Predictive Control for Racing in Adverse Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) algorithms can be sensitive to model mismatch when used in challenging nonlinear control tasks. In particular, the performance of MPC for vehicle control at the limits of handling suffers when the underlying model overestimates the vehicle's capabilities. In this work, we propose a risk-averse MPC framework that explicitly accounts for uncertainty over friction limits and tire parameters. Our approach leverages a sample-based approximation of an optimal control problem with a conditional value at risk (CVaR) constraint. This sample-based formulation enables planning with a set of expressive vehicle dynamics models using different tire parameters. Moreover, this formulation enables efficient numerical resolution via sequential quadratic programming and GPU parallelization. Experiments on a Lexus LC 500 show that risk-averse MPC unlocks reliable performance, while a deterministic baseline that plans using a single dynamics model may lose control of the vehicle in adverse road conditions.</description>

      <title>DyPNIPP: Predicting Environment Dynamics for RL-based Robust Informative Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informative path planning (IPP) is an important planning paradigm for various real-world robotic applications such as environment monitoring. IPP involves planning a path that can learn an accurate belief of the quantity of interest, while adhering to planning constraints. Traditional IPP methods typically require high computation time during execution, giving rise to reinforcement learning (RL) based IPP methods. However, the existing RL-based methods do not consider spatio-temporal environments which involve their own challenges due to variations in environment characteristics. In this paper, we propose DyPNIPP, a robust RL-based IPP framework, designed to operate effectively across spatio-temporal environments with varying dynamics. To achieve this, DyPNIPP incorporates domain randomization to train the agent across diverse environments and introduces a dynamics prediction model to capture and adapt the agent actions to specific environment dynamics. Our extensive experiments in a wildfire environment demonstrate that DyPNIPP outperforms existing RL-based IPP algorithms by significantly improving robustness and performing across diverse environment conditions.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Violation Temporal Logic Planning for Heterogeneous Robots under Robot Skill Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider teams of robots with heterogeneous skills (e.g., sensing and manipulation) tasked with collaborative missions described by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. These LTL-encoded tasks require robots to apply their skills to specific regions and objects in a temporal and logical order. While existing temporal logic planning algorithms can synthesize correct-by-construction paths, they typically lack reactivity to unexpected failures of robot skills, which can compromise mission performance. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a reactive LTL planning algorithm that adapts to unexpected failures during deployment. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reassigns sub-tasks to robots based on their functioning skills and locally revises team plans to accommodate these new assignments and ensure mission completion. The main novelty of the proposed algorithm is its ability to handle cases where mission completion becomes impossible due to limited functioning robots. Instead of reporting mission failure, the algorithm strategically prioritizes the most crucial sub-tasks and locally revises the team's plans, as per user-specified priorities, to minimize mission violations. We provide theoretical conditions under which the proposed framework computes the minimum violation task reassignments and team plans. We provide numerical and hardware experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Learning Precise, Contact-Rich Manipulation through Uncalibrated Tactile Skins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While visuomotor policy learning has advanced robotic manipulation, precisely executing contact-rich tasks remains challenging due to the limitations of vision in reasoning about physical interactions. To address this, recent work has sought to integrate tactile sensing into policy learning. However, many existing approaches rely on optical tactile sensors that are either restricted to recognition tasks or require complex dimensionality reduction steps for policy learning. In this work, we explore learning policies with magnetic skin sensors, which are inherently low-dimensional, highly sensitive, and inexpensive to integrate with robotic platforms. To leverage these sensors effectively, we present the Visuo-Skin (ViSk) framework, a simple approach that uses a transformer-based policy and treats skin sensor data as additional tokens alongside visual information. Evaluated on four complex real-world tasks involving credit card swiping, plug insertion, USB insertion, and bookshelf retrieval, ViSk significantly outperforms both vision-only and optical tactile sensing based policies. Further analysis reveals that combining tactile and visual modalities enhances policy performance and spatial generalization, achieving an average improvement of 27.5% across tasks. https://visuoskin.github.io/</description>

      <title>Policies with Sparse Inter-Agent Dependencies in Dynamic Games: A Dynamic Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common feedback strategies in multi-agent dynamic games require all players' state information to compute control strategies. However, in real-world scenarios, sensing and communication limitations between agents make full state feedback expensive or impractical, and such strategies can become fragile when state information from other agents is inaccurate. To this end, we propose a regularized dynamic programming approach for finding sparse feedback policies that selectively depend on the states of a subset of agents in dynamic games. The proposed approach solves convex adaptive group Lasso problems to compute sparse policies approximating Nash equilibrium solutions. We prove the regularized solutions' asymptotic convergence to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium policies in linear-quadratic (LQ) games. We extend the proposed approach to general non-LQ games via an iterative algorithm. Empirical results in multi-robot interaction scenarios show that the proposed approach effectively computes feedback policies with varying sparsity levels. When agents have noisy observations of other agents' states, simulation results indicate that the proposed regularized policies consistently achieve lower costs than standard Nash equilibrium policies by up to 77% for all interacting agents whose costs are coupled with other agents' states.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Complex Reward Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in control problems, but its practical application is often hindered by the complexity arising from intricate reward functions with constraints. While the reward hypothesis suggests these competing demands can be encapsulated in a single scalar reward function, designing such functions remains challenging. Building on existing work, we start by formulating preferences over trajectories to derive a realistic reward function that balances goal achievement with constraint satisfaction in the application of mobile robotics with dynamic obstacles. To mitigate reward exploitation in such complex settings, we propose a novel two-stage reward curriculum combined with a flexible replay buffer that adaptively samples experiences. Our approach first learns on a subset of rewards before transitioning to the full reward, allowing the agent to learn trade-offs between objectives and constraints. After transitioning to a new stage, our method continues to make use of past experiences by updating their rewards for sample-efficient learning. We investigate the efficacy of our approach in robot navigation tasks and demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in terms of true reward achievement and task completion, underlining its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>E-3DGS: Gaussian Splatting with Exposure and Motion Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from images captured under optimal conditions has been extensively explored in the vision community. However, robotic applications often face challenges such as motion blur, insufficient illumination, and high computational overhead, which adversely affect downstream tasks like navigation, inspection, and scene visualization. To address these challenges, we propose E-3DGS, a novel event-based approach that partitions events into motion (from camera or object movement) and exposure (from camera exposure), using the former to handle fast-motion scenes and using the latter to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce a novel integration of 3DGS with exposure events for high-quality reconstruction of explicit scene representations. Our versatile framework can operate on motion events alone for 3D reconstruction, enhance quality using exposure events, or adopt a hybrid mode that balances quality and effectiveness by optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. We also introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method is faster and delivers better reconstruction quality than event-based NeRF while being more cost-effective than NeRF methods that combine event and RGB data by using a single event sensor. By combining motion and exposure events, E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands. The source code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/MasterHow/E-3DGS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the consistency issue of multi-robot distributed cooperative localization. We introduce a consistent distributed cooperative localization algorithm conducting state estimation in a transformed coordinate. The core idea involves a linear time-varying coordinated transformation to render the propagation Jacobian independent of the state and make it suitable for a distributed manner. This transformation is seamlessly integrated into a server-based distributed cooperative localization framework, in which each robot estimates its own state while the server maintains the cross-correlations. The transformation ensures the correct observability property of the entire framework. Moreover, the algorithm accommodates various types of robot-to-robot relative measurements, broadening its applicability. Through simulations and real-world dataset experiments, the proposed algorithm has demonstrated better performance in terms of both consistency and accuracy compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Matters: Rethinking the Impact of Different Observation Spaces on Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robot learning, the observation space is crucial due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities, which can potentially become a bottleneck alongside policy design. In this study, we explore the influence of various observation spaces on robot learning, focusing on three predominant modalities: RGB, RGB-D, and point cloud. We introduce OBSBench, a benchmark comprising two simulators and 125 tasks, along with standardized pipelines for various encoders and policy baselines. Extensive experiments on diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks reveal a notable trend: point cloud-based methods, even those with the simplest designs, frequently outperform their RGB and RGB-D counterparts. This trend persists in both scenarios: training from scratch and utilizing pre-training. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that point cloud observations often yield better policy performance and significantly stronger generalization capabilities across various geometric and visual conditions. These outcomes suggest that the 3D point cloud is a valuable observation modality for intricate robotic tasks. We also suggest that incorporating both appearance and coordinate information can enhance the performance of point cloud methods. We hope our work provides valuable insights and guidance for designing more generalizable and robust robotic models.

      <title>AED: Adaptable Error Detection for Few-shot Imitation Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new task called Adaptable Error Detection (AED), which aims to identify behavior errors in few-shot imitation (FSI) policies based on visual observations in novel environments. The potential to cause serious damage to surrounding areas limits the application of FSI policies in real-world scenarios. Thus, a robust system is necessary to notify operators when FSI policies are inconsistent with the intent of demonstrations. This task introduces three challenges: (1) detecting behavior errors in novel environments, (2) identifying behavior errors that occur without revealing notable changes, and (3) lacking complete temporal information of the rollout due to the necessity of online detection. However, the existing benchmarks cannot support the development of AED because their tasks do not present all these challenges. To this end, we develop a cross-domain AED benchmark, consisting of 322 base and 153 novel environments. Additionally, we propose Pattern Observer (PrObe) to address these challenges. PrObe is equipped with a powerful pattern extractor and guided by novel learning objectives to parse discernible patterns in the policy feature representations of normal or error states. Through our comprehensive evaluation, PrObe demonstrates superior capability to detect errors arising from a wide range of FSI policies, consistently surpassing strong baselines. Moreover, we conduct detailed ablations and a pilot study on error correction to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture design and the practicality of the AED task, respectively.

Abstract: Autonomous robots exploring unknown environments face a significant challenge: navigating effectively without prior maps and with limited external feedback. This challenge intensifies in sparse reward environments, where traditional exploration techniques often fail. In this paper, we present TopoNav, a novel topological navigation framework that integrates active mapping, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and intrinsic motivation to enable efficient goal-oriented exploration and navigation in sparse-reward settings. TopoNav dynamically constructs a topological map of the environment, capturing key locations and pathways. A two-level hierarchical policy architecture, comprising a high-level graph traversal policy and low-level motion control policies, enables effective navigation and obstacle avoidance while maintaining focus on the overall goal. Additionally, TopoNav incorporates intrinsic motivation to guide exploration toward relevant regions and frontier nodes in the topological map, addressing the challenges of sparse extrinsic rewards. We evaluate TopoNav both in the simulated and real-world off-road environments using a Clearpath Jackal robot, across three challenging navigation scenarios: goal-reaching, feature-based navigation, and navigation in complex terrains. We observe an increase in exploration coverage by 7- 20%, in success rates by 9-19%, and reductions in navigation times by 15-36% across various scenarios, compared to state-of-the-art methods</description>

      <title>Using Fiber Optic Bundles to Miniaturize Vision-Based Tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors have recently become popular due to their combination of low cost, very high spatial resolution, and ease of integration using widely available miniature cameras. The associated field of view and focal length, however, are difficult to package in a human-sized finger. In this paper we employ optical fiber bundles to achieve a form factor that, at 15 mm diameter, is smaller than an average human fingertip. The electronics and camera are also located remotely, further reducing package size. The sensor achieves a spatial resolution of 0.22 mm and a minimum force resolution 5 mN for normal and shear contact forces. With these attributes, the DIGIT Pinki sensor is suitable for applications such as robotic and teleoperated digital palpation. We demonstrate its utility for palpation of the prostate gland and show that it can achieve clinically relevant discrimination of prostate stiffness for phantom and ex vivo tissue.</description>

      <title>PhysORD: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Physics-infused Motion Prediction in Off-road Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, it presents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of the complex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditional physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic systems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networks require extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing the fundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. By merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models, potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance by modeling uncertainties. The learned dynamics model achieves 46.7% higher accuracy using only 3.1% of the parameters compared to data-driven methods, demonstrating the data efficiency and superior generalization ability of our neural-symbolic method.</description>

      <title>PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-based Multiagent Trajectory Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Is Your HD Map Constructor Reliable under Sensor Corruptions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving systems often rely on high-definition (HD) maps for precise environmental information, which is crucial for planning and navigation. While current HD map constructors perform well under ideal conditions, their resilience to real-world challenges, \eg, adverse weather and sensor failures, is not well understood, raising safety concerns. This work introduces MapBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of HD map construction methods against various sensor corruptions. Our benchmark encompasses a total of 29 types of corruptions that occur from cameras and LiDAR sensors. Extensive evaluations across 31 HD map constructors reveal significant performance degradation of existing methods under adverse weather conditions and sensor failures, underscoring critical safety concerns. We identify effective strategies for enhancing robustness, including innovative approaches that leverage multi-modal fusion, advanced data augmentation, and architectural techniques. These insights provide a pathway for developing more reliable HD map construction methods, which are essential for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit and affiliated code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>EMPOWER: Embodied Multi-role Open-vocabulary Planning with Online Grounding and Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task planning for robots in real-life settings presents significant challenges. These challenges stem from three primary issues: the difficulty in identifying grounded sequences of steps to achieve a goal; the lack of a standardized mapping between high-level actions and low-level commands; and the challenge of maintaining low computational overhead given the limited resources of robotic hardware. We introduce EMPOWER, a framework designed for open-vocabulary online grounding and planning for embodied agents aimed at addressing these issues. By leveraging efficient pre-trained foundation models and a multi-role mechanism, EMPOWER demonstrates notable improvements in grounded planning and execution. Quantitative results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an average success rate of 0.73 across six different real-life scenarios using a TIAGo robot.</description>

      <title>Developing Path Planning with Behavioral Cloning and Proximal Policy Optimization for Path-Tracking and Static Obstacle Nudging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end methods utilizing Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are becoming more and more common. However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow and planning with horizons, resulting in strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce a path planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference waypoints and performs modified path for different controllers. Experimental results show that the algorithm can do path following that mimics the expert performance of path-tracking controllers, and avoid collision to fixed obstacles. The method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in path planning problems of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Competency-Aware Planning for Probabilistically Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>3D-TAFS: A Training-free Framework for 3D Affordance Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Translating high-level linguistic instructions into precise robotic actions in the physical world remains challenging, particularly when considering the feasibility of interacting with 3D objects. In this paper, we introduce 3D-TAFS, a novel training-free multimodal framework for 3D affordance segmentation, alongside a benchmark for evaluating interactive language-guided affordance in everyday environments. In particular, our framework integrates a large multimodal model with a specialized 3D vision network, enabling seamless fusion of 2D and 3D visual understanding with language comprehension. To facilitate evaluation, we present a dataset of ten typical indoor environments, each with 50 images annotated for object actions and 3D affordance segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the proposed 3D-TAFS's capability in handling interactive 3D affordance segmentation tasks across diverse settings, showcasing competitive performance across various metrics. Our results highlight 3D-TAFS's potential for enhancing human-robot interaction based on affordance understanding in complex indoor environments, advancing the development of more intuitive and efficient robotic frameworks for real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control method for an autonomous wheel loader, enabling time-efficient navigation to an arbitrary goal pose. Unlike prior works that combine high-level trajectory planners with Model Predictive Control (MPC), we directly enhance the planning capabilities of MPC by integrating a cost function derived from Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we train an RL agent to solve the pose reaching task in simulation, then incorporate the trained neural network critic as both the stage and terminal cost of an MPC. We show through comprehensive simulations that the resulting MPC inherits the time-efficient behavior of the RL agent, generating trajectories that compare favorably against those found using trajectory optimization. We also deploy our method on a real wheel loader, where we successfully navigate to various goal poses.</description>

Abstract: We present a system that transforms speech into physical objects by combining 3D generative Artificial Intelligence with robotic assembly. The system leverages natural language input to make design and manufacturing more accessible, enabling individuals without expertise in 3D modeling or robotic programming to create physical objects. We propose utilizing discrete robotic assembly of lattice-based voxel components to address the challenges of using generative AI outputs in physical production, such as design variability, fabrication speed, structural integrity, and material waste. The system interprets speech to generate 3D objects, discretizes them into voxel components, computes an optimized assembly sequence, and generates a robotic toolpath. The results are demonstrated through the assembly of various objects, ranging from chairs to shelves, which are prompted via speech and realized within 5 minutes using a 6-axis robotic arm.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs for Long-term Language-Guided Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabling mobile robots to perform long-term tasks in dynamic real-world environments is a formidable challenge, especially when the environment changes frequently due to human-robot interactions or the robot's own actions. Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) require diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios for effective training and testing, but the existing data generation methods struggle to provide flexibility and scalability. We propose LASER, a novel frame-work that leverage large language models (LLMs) to conduct traffic simulations based on natural language inputs. The framework operates in two stages: it first generates scripts from user-provided descriptions and then executes them using autonomous agents in real time. Validated in the CARLA simulator, LASER successfully generates complex, on-demand driving scenarios, significantly improving ADS training and testing data generation.</description>

      <title>Incremental Joint Learning of Depth, Pose and Implicit Scene Representation on Monocular Camera in Large-scale Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense scene reconstruction for photo-realistic view synthesis has various applications, such as VR/AR, autonomous vehicles. However, most existing methods have difficulties in large-scale scenes due to three core challenges: \textit{(a) inaccurate depth input.} Accurate depth input is impossible to get in real-world large-scale scenes. \textit{(b) inaccurate pose estimation.} Most existing approaches rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses. \textit{(c) insufficient scene representation capability.} A single global radiance field lacks the capacity to effectively scale to large-scale scenes. To this end, we propose an incremental joint learning framework, which can achieve accurate depth, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction. A vision transformer-based network is adopted as the backbone to enhance performance in scale information estimation. For pose estimation, a feature-metric bundle adjustment (FBA) method is designed for accurate and robust camera tracking in large-scale scenes. In terms of implicit scene representation, we propose an incremental scene representation method to construct the entire large-scale scene as multiple local radiance fields to enhance the scalability of 3D scene representation. Extended experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method in depth estimation, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more robust and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator, and design diffusion rewards based on the classifier's output for policy learning. Extensive experiments are conducted in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL's effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more robust and smoother rewards. Project page: https://nturobotlearninglab.github.io/DRAIL/</description>

Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could transform computing interactions. However, achieving the resolution, speed, and dynamic range needed for perceptual fidelity remains challenging. We present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns via a photomechanical surface populated with millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through photostimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding millimeter scale displacements with response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Employing projected light for power transmission and addressing renders these displays highly scalable. We demonstrate devices with up to 1511 addressable pixels. Perceptual studies confirm that they can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns with high fidelity. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>
