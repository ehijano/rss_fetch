      <title>StockTime: A Time Series Specialized Large Language Model Architecture for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stock price prediction task holds a significant role in the financial domain and has been studied for a long time. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent financial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in financial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), challenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating the modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these capabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and interpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series data. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in financial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced with such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based architecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs, StockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It leverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating stock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as stock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock prices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the embedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts stock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate that StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions while reducing memory usage and runtime costs.</description>

      <title>LSR-IGRU: Stock Trend Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Relationships and Improved GRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods.

      <title>Comparative Study of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM): Prediction of Stock Market Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, financial analysts have been trying to develop models to predict the movement of a stock price index. The task becomes challenging in vague economic, social, and political situations like in Pakistan. In this study, we employed efficient models of machine learning such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) to predict the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 index by taking monthly data of twenty-six economic, social, political, and administrative indicators from February 2004 to December 2020. The comparative results of LSTM and QLSTM predicted values of the KSE 100 index with the actual values suggested QLSTM a potential technique to predict stock market trends.</description>

      <title>On the macroeconomic fundamentals of long-term volatilities and dynamic correlations in COMEX copper futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the influence of low-frequency macroeconomic variables on the high-frequency returns of copper futures and the long-term correlation with the S&amp;P 500 index, employing GARCH-MIDAS and DCC-MIDAS modeling frameworks. The estimated results of GARCH-MIDAS show that realized volatility (RV), level of interest rates (IR), industrial production (IP) and producer price index (PPI), volatility of Slope, PPI, consumer sentiment index (CSI), and dollar index (DI) have significant impacts on Copper futures returns, among which PPI is the most efficient macroeconomic variable. From comparison among DCC-GARCH and DCC-MIDAS model, the added MIDAS filter of PPI improves the model fitness and have better performance than RV in effecting the long-run relationship between Copper futures and S&amp;P 500.</description>

      <title>Tuning into Climate Risks: Extracting Innovation from TV News for Clean Energy Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops multiple novel climate risk measures (or variables) based on the television news coverage by Bloomberg, CNBC, and Fox Business, and examines how they affect the systematic and idiosyncratic risks of clean energy firms in the United States (US). The measures are built on climate related keywords and cover the volume of coverage, type of coverage (climate crisis, renewable energy, and government and human initiatives), and media sentiments. We show that an increase in the aggregate measure of climate risk, as indicated by coverage volume, reduces idiosyncratic risk while increasing systematic risk. When climate risk is segregated, we find that systematic risk is positively affected by the \textit{physical risk} of climate crises and \textit{transition risk} from government and human initiatives, but no such impact is evident for idiosyncratic risk. Additionally, we observe an asymmetry in risk behavior: negative sentiments tend to increase idiosyncratic risk and decrease systematic risk, while positive sentiments have no significant impact. This asymmetry persists even when considering print media variables, climate policy uncertainty, and analysis based on the COVID-19 period.</description>
