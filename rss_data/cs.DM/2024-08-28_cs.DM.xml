      <title>New Results on Periodic Golay Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$.</description>

      <title>Avoiding abelian and additive powers in rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the avoidability of abelian and additive powers in infinite rich words. In particular, we construct an infinite additive $5$-power-free rich word over $\{0,1\}$ and an infinite additive $4$-power-free rich word over $\{0, 1, 2\}$. The alphabet sizes are as small as possible in both cases, even for abelian powers.</description>

      <title>Towards an Optimal Contention Resolution Scheme for Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study contention resolution schemes for matchings. Given a fractional matching $x$ and a random set $R(x)$ where each edge $e$ appears independently with probability $x_e$, we want to select a matching $M \subseteq R(x)$ such that $\Pr[e \in M \mid e \in R(x)] \geq c$, for $c$ as large as possible. We call such a selection method a $c$-balanced contention resolution scheme.
  Our main results are (i) an asymptotically (in the limit as $\|x\|_\infty$ goes to 0) optimal $\simeq 0.544$-balanced contention resolution scheme for general matchings, and (ii) a $0.509$-balanced contention resolution scheme for bipartite matchings. To the best of our knowledge, this result establishes for the first time, in any natural relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem, a separation between (i) offline and random order online contention resolution schemes, and (ii) monotone and non-monotone contention resolution schemes. We also present an application of our scheme to a combinatorial allocation problem, and discuss some open questions related to van der Waerden's conjecture for the permanent of doubly stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>
