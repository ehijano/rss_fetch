      <title>Probing early parton emissions in heavy ion collisions using the Lund jet plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scattering experiments, high-virtuality partons, i.e., quarks and gluons, initiate a series of additional parton emissions to create collimated sprays of particles known as jets. This paper presents a measurement of the Lund jet plane (LJP) of high-energy jets produced in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions and compares the results to data for proton-proton (pp) collisions. The LJP is formed by iteratively declustering the constituents of a jet into consecutive emissions and recording the relative transverse momentum ($k_\mathrm{T}$) and angle of the resulting emission with respect to its emitter. The angular distributions of two different $k_\mathrm{T}$ slices of the LJP are investigated for jets with radius parameter of 0.4 and transverse momentum in the range 200$-$1000 GeV. The PbPb (pp) data were recorded by the CMS experiment in 2018 (2017) and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 nb$^{-1}$ (301 pb$^{-1}$) at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The measurement was designed to test whether the earliest jet emissions are produced before the formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in PbPb collisions. Within the experimental uncertainties, no significant difference is observed between the angular distribution of high-$k_\mathrm{T}$ emissions in \pp and PbPb collisions, which is consistent with these emissions occurring early in the jet evolution, before substantial interaction with the QGP.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Barrier Dynamics of Double-Alpha Decay in Heavy Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous emission of two $\alpha$ particles--double-$\alpha$ decay--represents a long-predicted but unobserved mode of nuclear radioactivity. Here we formulate this process as a genuine three-body problem within the hyperspherical coordinate framework and evaluate decay probabilities by numerically solving the corresponding hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation, combined with large-scale random sampling of the potential parameters; the latter treatment ensures that the present results are more convincing. Inspired by this, we demonstrate that the penetrability ratio between simultaneous and sequential $\alpha$ emission exhibits a strikingly linear dependence on $ZQ_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1/2}$, extending the barrier penetration dynamics into the correlated few-body regime. The nuclei $^{108}$Xe, $^{218}$Ra, $^{224}$Pu, $^{222}$U, $^{216}$Rn, and $^{220}$Th are suggested as the most promising candidates for the observation of double-$\alpha$ decay, with predicted half-lives potentially accessible within present detection limits. Our results provide a unified framework for multi-$\alpha$ decay and open a pathway to probing nuclear clustering and few-body correlations in heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclear constraints on $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda NN$ interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on using density dependent $\Lambda$-nuclear optical potentials in calculations of $\Lambda$-hypernuclear binding energies is reviewed. It is found that all known $\Lambda$ binding energies in the mass range $16 \leq A \leq 208$ are well fitted in terms of two interaction parameters: one, attractive, for the spin-averaged $\Lambda N$ interaction and another one, repulsive, for the $\Lambda NN$ interaction. The $\Lambda N$ interaction term by itself overbinds $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, in quantitative agreement with recent findings obtained in EFT and Femtoscopy studies. The strength of the $\Lambda NN$ interaction term is compatible with values required to resolve the hyperon puzzle.</description>

      <title>Liquid-gas phase transition of nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A survey is presented summarizing the empirical evidence for and interpretations of a first-order liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. Earlier developments and the present state of knowledge about the extraction of the critical point for such a transition, primarily from the systematics of multifragmention data, are outlined. By analogy with a Van der Waals equation of state, the empirically deduced critical temperature and pressure permit to draw a schematic picture of the underlying nuclear potential. More detailed approaches to the liquid-gas transition using self-consistent nuclear Hartree-Fock and variational calculations are described. Critical exponents are reported. Then chiral effective field theory, as the low-energy realization of QCD, is discussed in the context of nuclear thermodynamics. Its implications for the liquid-gas transition in symmetric nuclear matter as well as in neutron-rich matter are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Incomplete fusion in $^{193}$Ir($^{12}$C, x)$^{205}$Bi reaction at $E_{lab}$ $\approx$ 5-7 AMeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01632v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy heavy-ion induced reactions often involve incomplete fusion, but the dependence of ICF on various entrance-channel parameters remains unclear. In this work, we measure channel-by-channel production cross-sections of different evaporation residues populated via complete and/or incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{193}$Ir system at $E_{lab}$ $\approx$ 64--84 MeV ($\approx$ 5--7 AMeV) using the stacked-foil activation technique followed by offline $\gamma$-spectroscopy. Experimentally measured excitation functions have been analyzed in the framework of the statistical model code PACE4 using different values of the level-density parameter ($a$ = A/9-A/15 MeV${^{-1}}$). In the analysis of excitation functions, the $xn$ and $pxn$ channels (after correcting with their precursor contributions) have been explained fairly well with $a$ = A/13 MeV${^{-1}}$; however, almost all $\alpha$-emitting channels showed substantial enhancement over PACE4 predictions, which has been attributed to incomplete fusion. The incomplete fusion fraction ($F_{ICF}$) increases linearly with energy from 12\% to 18\% at 64 and 84 MeV, respectively. For better insights into the onset and strength of ICF, the variations of $F_{ICF}$ have been studied as a function of different entrance-channel parameters, which are found to increase with mass asymmetry, Coulomb factor, and neutron skin thickness. Further analysis of the data suggests the onset of ICF below the critical angular momentum ($\ell&lt;\ell_{crit}$). Projectile breakup-driven incomplete fusion is found to suppress complete fusion by $\approx12\%$ and $\approx6\%$ w.r.t. the universal fusion function and the improved fusion function, respectively. These findings highlight the critical role of projectile structure at 5--7 AMeV energies, with implications for high-spin spectroscopy and reaction modeling.</description>

      <title>Neutron spectrum measurement in the Yemi underground laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of neutron energy spectra at the newly established Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in the Republic of Korea, designed to host dark matter and rare-event search experiments. A high-sensitivity neutron spectrometer was employed, consisting of ten cylindrical {}^{3}He proportional counters, eight of which were embedded in cylindrical high-density polyethylene moderators of various sizes. To quantify and mitigate contributions from internal \alpha-backgrounds, each detector underwent a dedicated background measurement using a cadmium-shielded box. These backgrounds, primarily originating from trace amounts of U and Th in the stainless-steel housings, were characterized and subtracted during data analysis. Neutron measurements were carried out at three locations within the Yemilab between March to October 2023. After waveform-based event selection and correction for \alphasym-backgrounds, neutron count rates were estimated and corresponding energy spectra were reconstructed using the unfolding method. The total neutron fluence rates were measured ranged from (3.24 $\pm$ 0.11) to (4.01 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~ {cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, with thermal and fast neutron components (1 - 10 MeV) ranging from (1.32 $\pm$ 0.05) to (1.51 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times 10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$ and (0.27 $\pm$ 0.03) to (0.34 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, respectively.</description>
