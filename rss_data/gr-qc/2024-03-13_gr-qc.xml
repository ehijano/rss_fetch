      <title>The Effect of Quark-antiquark Confinement on the Deflection Angle by the NED Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the influence of quark-antiquark confinement on the deflection angle within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamic (NED) black holes. To achieve this, we establish the appropriate optical spacetime metric and subsequently determine the Gaussian optical curvature. Utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we investigate the impact of quark-antiquark confinement on the deflection angle exhibited by NED black holes. Additionally, we delve into the effects of a cold non-magnetized plasma medium and also axion-plasmon on gravitational lensing. Our findings highlight the significance of the axion-plasmon effect on the optical properties of NED black holes, particularly its influence on gravitational lensing. This exploration is particularly relevant in the context of the axion's potential role as a dark matter candidate. The multifaceted interplay between quark-antiquark confinement, nonlinear electrodynamics, and plasma dynamics provides a nuanced understanding of gravitational lensing phenomena. These insights contribute to ongoing research in dark matter studies and offer avenues for further theoretical and observational investigations in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The \v{d}Alembert solution in hyperboloidal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Selecting energy-momentum trace dependent gravity theories with LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(R, T)$ modified gravity theories being $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We provide detailed equations for the matter energy density contrast. We solve then numerically to promote a comparison with available large scale structure (LSS) formation observational data on $f \sigma_8$ and also addressing the $S_8$ tension. We identify $f(R,T)$ models that lead either to growth enhancement or suppression. Since recent results in the literature indicate a preference for the latter feature, this type of analysis is quite useful to select viable modifications of gravity. We studied class of such $f(R,T)$ models are either ruled out or severely restricted.</description>

      <title>How closed is cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical cosmology exhibits a particular kind of scaling symmetry. The dynamics of the invariants of this symmetry forms a system that exhibits many of the features of open systems such as the non-conservation of mechanical energy and the focusing of measures along the dynamical flow. From these properties, we show that important dynamical features emerge that are not present in closed systems. In particular, a large and physically plausible class of cosmological models give rise to a natural arrow of time. We then argue that the appropriate notion of closure in cosmology is dynamical closure - that a system can be integrated without reference to external factors. This is realised in physical systems in terms of the algebraic closure of the equations of motion such that the system is autonomous. Remarkably, in a growing class of models it can be shown that the autonomous system obtained remains regular and can be integrated through the big bang.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Extra Dimensions on Neutron Star Structure and Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the impact of higher dimensional spacetime on the stellar structure and thermodynamic properties of neutron stars. Utilizing the density-dependent relativistic hadron field theory, we introduce modifications to incorporate the influence of higher dimensionality, a novel approach not explored in existing literature to our best knowledge. Our methodology involves solving the essential stellar structure equations in D-dimensional spacetime ($D \geq 4$), starting with the modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, derivation of the Einstein field equation in D dimensions, and application of the resulting exterior Schwarzschild spacetime metric for D-dimension. Our findings reveal that with incremental dimensions, the central density $\rho_{c} G_D$ and central pressure $p_c G_D$ gradually increase, leading to progressively stiffer neutron matter. Incremental dimensionality also results in a gradual increase in the maximum mass attained, limited to our study between $D=4$ and $D=6$, as no maximum mass value is obtained for $D&gt;6$. We consistently observe the criteria $dM/d\rho_c&gt;0$ fulfilled up to the maximum mass point, supported by stability analysis against infinitesimal radial pulsations. The validity of our solution is confirmed through causality conditions, ensuring that the matter sound speed remains within the speed of light for all cases. Additionally, our examination indicates that the total mass-to-radius ratio for all discussed D-dimensional cases comfortably resides within the modified Buchdahl limit, which exhibits the physical validity of achieved results.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications from some proposals in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we present the cosmological applications of some proposals from Quantum Gravity. Namely, we will explore classical and quantum cosmological implications of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of gravity and the Swampland Conjectures. Furthermore, we will also present a detailed analysis of Lorentzian Vacuum Transitions in various contexts.
  First of all, we will present a study of the classical implications of a general form of the GUP to the standard inflationary scenario driven by a scalar field. We will then present the study of the compatibility between the dS swampland conjecture and the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz $F(\bar{R})$ theories. Then we will study the effects of considering a GUP in the variables of the superspace in a model of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation in HL gravity. Finally, we will present a general study of the Lorentzian vacuum transitions. We will present a general method to compute the transition probabilities between two minima of a scalar field potential for any model of the superspace that leads to a generic form of the Hamiltonian constraint, by solving the WDW equation with a semiclassical expansion. We will only consider up to first order in this expansion but the method provides enough information to compute the probabilities up to any desired order. We will then apply the method in different scenarios.
  With these studies we will approach keys aspects of cosmology that are hoped to be solved by quantum gravity, that is we will explore (at a toy model level): the origin of inflation, the viability of the swampland conjectures and a plausible model to avoid the initial singularity. This thesis encompasses six research articles where these results were presented originally.</description>

      <title>Integrating Gauss-Bonnet Corrections in Quantum Field Theory: Implications for Torsion, Gauge Bosons, and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore matter fields containing Gauss-Bonnet correction terms within the framework of renormalizable quantum field theory. By revising the gauge model with a charged scalar multiplier and two sets of fermion families within a flat universe model using torsion, we introduce Gauss-Bonnet corrections into the action to investigate field equations within the context of supersymmetric mixed inflationary models. After analytically computing the modified gauge boson field equations through the incorporation of Gauss-Bonnet theory into the fundamental field equations, we derive the torsion characteristics and energy-momentum tensor properties of a flat universe. Our analysis can extend to more specific Gauss-Bonnet correction models, enabling the derivation of gravitational characteristic equations with practical applications. This streamlines Gauss-Bonnet models, assesses the model's sensitivity to correction parameters, and explores high-sensitivity models with observational significance. Furthermore, in this derivation process, we identify that Gauss-Bonnet correction terms can directly impact the Hubble constant through Einstein's equations, indicating the potential for verifying Gauss-Bonnet theory through astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>The Kerr Memory Effect at Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the memory effect due to a gravitational wave striking a Kerr black hole as seen by an observer at null infinity. This is done by working in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. It was shown by Hawking, Perry, and Strominger (HPS) that the memory effect due to a gravitational shockwave is seen as a pure BMS supertranslation from null infinity. Hence, it is of interest to compute the supertranslated Kerr solution in Bondi--Sachs coordinates. Finally, the gravitational wave is said to implant soft supertranslation hair on the event horizon of the black hole which carries superrotation charge. We will explicitly calculate the change in superrotation charge on the event horizon due to the supertranslation hair.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Generalized No-Scale Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity, and study the corresponding inflationary models. With a new parameter $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\alpha\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) with various mass scales, which could account for an significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>The post--quasi-static approximation: An analytical approach to gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi--numerical approach proposed many years ago for describing gravitational collapse in the post--quasi--static approximation, is modified in order to avoid the numerical integration of the basic differential equations the approach is based upon. For doing that we have to impose some restrictions on the fluid distribution. More specifically, we shall assume the vanishing complexity factor condition, which allows for analytical integration of the pertinent differential equations and leads to physically interesting models. Instead, we show that neither the homologous nor the quasi--homologous evolution are acceptable since they lead to geodesic fluids, which are unsuitable for being described in the post--quasi--static approximation. Also, we prove that, within this approximation, adiabatic evolution also leads to geodesic fluids and therefore we shall consider exclusively dissipative systems. Besides the vanishing complexity factor condition, additional information is required for a full description of models. We shall propose different strategies for obtaining such an information, which are based on observables quantities (e.g. luminosity and redshift), and/or heuristic mathematical ansatz. To illustrate the method, we present two models. One model is inspired in the well known Schwarzschild interior solution, and another one is inspired in Tolman VI solution.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) remains the most accurate theory of gravity to date. It has passed many experimental tests in the Solar System as well as binary pulsar, cosmological and gravitational-wave (GW) observations. Some of these tests probe regimes where gravitational fields are weak, the spacetime curvature is small, and the characteristic velocities are not comparable to the speed of light. Observations of compact binary coalescences enable us to test GR in extreme environments of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, large spacetime curvature, and velocities comparable to the speed of light. Since the breakthrough observation of the first GW signal produced by the merger of two black holes, GW150914, in September 2015, the number of confirmed detections of binary mergers has rapidly increased to nearly 100. The analysis of these events has already placed significant constraints on possible deviations from GR and on the nature of the coalescing compact objects. In this chapter, we discuss a selection of tests of GR applicable to observations of GWs from compact binaries. In particular, we will cover consistency tests, which check for consistency between the different phases of the binary's evolution, tests of GW generation, polarization and propagation, and tests of the remnant's nature. We conclude with a brief overview of the challenges and prospects for present and future observatories.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp. TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the ``no observer horizon'' conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture.</description>

      <title>Infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections: Quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of D-dimensional regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Bueno, Cano, and Hennigar [arXiv: 2403.04827] proposed a generic approach for incorporating an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections into the Einstein theory. In this study, we compute quasinormal modes for certain regular D-dimensional black holes resulting from this infinite series of higher curvature corrections, specifically focusing on the D-dimensional extensions of the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode is minimally affected by moderate coupling constants, the higher overtones exhibit significant sensitivity even to small coupling values, yielding unconventional modes characterized by vanishing real oscillation frequencies.</description>

      <title>Celestial $w_{1+\infty}$ charges and the subleading structure of asymptotically-flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the subleading structure of asymptotically-flat spacetimes and its relationship to the $w_{1+\infty}$ loop algebra of higher spin charges. We do so using both the Bondi-Sachs and the Newman-Penrose formalism, via a dictionary built from a preferred choice of tetrad. This enables us to access properties of the so-called higher Bondi aspects, such as their evolution equations, their transformation laws under asymptotic symmetries, and their relationship to the Newman-Penrose and the higher spin charges. By studying the recursive Einstein evolution equations defining these higher spin charges, we derive the general form of their transformation behavior under BMSW symmetries. This leads to an immediate proof that the spin 0,1 and spin $s$ brackets reproduce upon linearization the structure expected from the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We then define renormalized higher spin charges which are conserved in the radiative vacuum at quadratic order, and show that they satisfy for all spins the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra at linear order in the radiative data.</description>

      <title>Firewalls at exponentially late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a version of the typical state firewall setup recently reintroduced by Stanford and Yang, who found that wormholes may create firewalls. We examine a late-time double scaling limit in JT gravity in which one can resum the expansion in the number of wormholes, and we use this to study the exact distribution of interior slices at times exponential in the entropy. We consider a thermofield double with and without early perturbations on a boundary. These perturbations can appear on interior slices as dangerous high energy shocks. For exponentially late times, wormholes tend to teleport the particles created by perturbations and render the interior more dangerous. In states with many perturbations separated by large times, the probability of a safe interior is exponentially small. Such states thus almost certainly have firewalls at the horizon, even though they would be safe without wormholes. With perturbation, even in the safest state we conceive, the odds of encountering a firewall are fifty-fifty. One interpretation of the phenomena found here is that wormholes can change time-ordered contours into effective out-of-time-ordered folds, making shockwaves appear in unexpected places.</description>

      <title>Gravitational back-reaction is the Holographic Dual of Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic approximately equals the rate of change of minimal surface area in response to the change of the tension of cosmic branes in the bulk.</description>

      <title>On classical de Sitter solutions and parametric control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding string backgrounds with de Sitter spacetime, where all approximations and corrections are controlled, is an open problem. We revisit the search for de Sitter solutions in the classical regime for specific type IIB supergravity compactifications on group manifolds, an under-explored corner of the landscape that offers an interesting testing ground for swampland conjectures. While the supergravity de Sitter solutions we obtain numerically are ambiguous in terms of their classicality, we find an analytic scaling that makes four out of six compactification radii, as well as the overall volume, arbitrarily large. This potentially provides parametric control over corrections. If we could show that these solutions, or others to be found, are fully classical, they would constitute a counterexample to conjectures stating that asymptotic de Sitter solutions do not exist. We discuss this point in great detail.</description>

      <title>The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia: A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia is studied in a unified way. We make use of an algebraic approach, as opposed to an analytic approach. We examine how both the integer and the fractional quantum Hall effects behave under a combined influence of gravity and inertia using a unified Hamiltonian. For that purpose, we first re-derive, using the purely algebraic method, the energy spectrum of charged particles moving in a plane perpendicular to a constant and uniform magnetic field either (i) under the influence of a nonlinear gravitational potential or (ii) under the influence of a constant rotation. The general Hamiltonian for describing the combined effect of gravity, rotation and inertia on the electrons of a Hall sample is then built and the eigenstates are obtained. The electrons mutual Coulomb interaction that gives rise to the familiar fractional quantum Hall effect is also discussed within a such a combination.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Fundamental Interactions via Isotopic Shifts in Molecular Lattice Clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements with ultracold atoms and molecules are primed to probe beyond-the-Standard Model physics. Isotopologues of homonuclear molecules are a natural testbed for new Yukawa-type mass-dependent forces at nanometer scales, complementing existing mesoscopic-body and neutron scattering experiments. Here we propose using isotopic shift measurements in molecular lattice clocks to constrain these new interactions from new massive scalar particles in keV$/c^2$ range: the new interaction would impart an extra isotopic shift to molecular levels on top of one predicted by the Standard Model. For the strontium dimer, a Hz-level agreement between experiment and theory could constrain the coupling of the new particles to hadrons by up to an order-of-magnitude over the most stringent existing experiments.</description>

      <title>Properties of Dynamical Black Hole Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first law for non-stationary perturbations of a stationary black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon, that relates the first-order change in the mass and angular momentum to the change in the entropy of an arbitrary horizon cross-section. Recently, Hollands, Wald and Zhang [1] have shown that the dynamical black hole entropy that satisfies this first law, for general relativity, is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{BH}}$, where $v$ is the affine parameter of the null horizon generators and $S_{\text{BH}}$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and for general diffeomorphism covariant theories of gravity $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, where $S_{\text{Wall}}$ is the Wall entropy. They obtained the first law by applying the Noether charge method to non-stationary perturbations and arbitrary cross-sections. In this formalism, the dynamical black hole entropy is defined as an "improved" Noether charge, which is unambiguous to first order in the perturbation. In the present article we provide a pedagogical derivation of the physical process version of the non-stationary first law for general relativity by integrating the linearised Raychaudhuri equation between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections. Moreover, we generalise the derivation of the first law in [1] to non-minimally coupled matter fields, using boost weight arguments rather than Killing field arguments, and we relax some of the gauge conditions on the perturbations by allowing for non-zero variations of the horizon Killing field and surface gravity. Finally, for $f(\text{Riemann})$ theories of gravity we show explicitly using Gaussian null coordinates that the improved Noether charge is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, which is a non-trivial check of [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In black hole thermodynamics, defining coarse-grained entropy for dynamical black holes has long been a challenge, and various proposals, such as generalized entropy, have been explored. Guided by the AdS/CFT, we introduce a new definition of coarse-grained entropy for a dynamical black hole in Lorentzian Einstein gravity. On each time slice, this entropy is defined as the horizon area of an auxiliary Euclidean black hole that shares the same mass, (angular) momenta, and asymptotic normalizable matter modes with the original Lorentzian solution. The entropy is shown to satisfy a generalized first law and, through holography, the second law as well. Furthermore, by applying this thermodynamics to several Vaidya models in AdS and flat spacetime, we discover a connection between the second law and the null energy condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>Conformal anomalies for (maximal) 6d conformal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the conformal anomalies for 6d (2,0) conformal supergravity by direct calculation in component fields. The main novel results consist of the type-B anomaly coefficients for the gravitino and the 3-form, as well as their explicit quadratic action on some specific backgrounds. We also comment on the graviton contribution, whose Lagrangian is essentially given by the $\mathscr Q$-curvature. We confirm the expectation that, when coupling (2,0) conformal supergravity to 26 copies of the (2,0) tensor multiplet, the resulting theory is free of conformal anomalies. We also consider the conformal anomalies for its (1,0) truncation and confirm their relation with the chiral anomaly polynomial recently derived. For calculating the anomalies, we work with an Einstein on-shell background and make a factorised Ansatz for the operators governing the quadratic fluctuations. This reduces the calculation to evaluating heat-kernel coefficients of standard 2-derivative operators. We fix and check the Ansatz against the explicit evaluation of the component-field supergravity action in some cases.</description>

      <title>Memory of a Random Walk: Astrometric deflections from gravitational wave memory accumulation over cosmological scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of gravitational wave memory on the distribution of far away light sources in the sky. For the first time we compute the built up of small, but permanent tensor distortions of the metric over cosmological time-scales using realistic models of compact binary coalescences (CBCs) whose rate of occurrence is extrapolated at $z\sim {\cal O}(1)$. This allows for a consistent computation of the random-walk like evolution of gravitational wave memory which, in turn, is used to estimate the overall shape and magnitude of astrometric deflections of far away sources of light. We find that for pulsar or quasar proper motions, the near-Earth contribution to the astrometric deflections dominates the result and the deflection is analogous to a stochastic gravitational wave memory background that is generally subdominant to the primary stochastic gravitational wave background. We find that this contribution can be within the reach of future surveys such as Theia. Finally, we also study the deviation of the presently observed angular distribution of quasars from perfect isotropy, which arises from the slow build-up of gravitational wave memory over the entire history of the universe. In this case, we find that astrometric deflections depend on the entire light trajectory from the source to the Earth, yielding a quadruple pattern whose magnitude is unlikely to be within reach of the next generation of astrometric surveys due to shot noise and cosmic variance limitations.</description>

      <title>Using Equation of State Constraints to Classify Low-Mass Compact Binary Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-perfomance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Bianchi type-$VI_0$ space time with domain walls in the framework of the modified $f (R, T)$ theory of gravitation. To solve the field equations, we assume that the shear scalar $(\sigma)$ is proportional to the expansion scalar $(\theta)$. We also consider the parametrization of the equation of the state parameter of barotropic fluid and discuss the effect on domain walls. It has been observed that the domain wall may behave like dark energy. Some physical parameters are also discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Rapid identification of time-frequency domain gravitational wave signals from binary black holes using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in deep learning techniques have offered an alternative and complementary approach to traditional matched filtering methods for the identification of gravitational wave (GW) signals. The rapid and accurate identification of GW signals is crucial for the progress of GW physics and multi-messenger astronomy, particularly in light of the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In this work, we use the 2D U-Net algorithm to identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers. We simulate BBH mergers with component masses from 5 to 80 $M_{\odot}$ and account for the LIGO detector noise. We find that the GW events in the first and second observation runs could all be clearly and rapidly identified. For the third observing run, about $80\%$ GW events could be identified. In particular, GW190814, currently unknown, is a special case that can be identified by the network, while other binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers can not be identified. Compared to the traditional convolutional neural network, the U-Net algorithm can output the time-frequency domain signal images rather than probabilities, providing a more intuitive investigation. Moreover, some of the results through U-Net can provide preliminary inference on the chirp mass information. In conclusion, the U-Net algorithm can rapidly identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from BBH mergers and potentially be helpful for future parameter inferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of ``dynamical gravastars'', constructed by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with relativistic matter, undergoing a phase transition at high pressure to a state with negative energy density, as allowed in quantum theory. Since generation of a horizon-like structure or ``simulated horizon'' occurs at a radius above where the phase transition occurs, it is solely a property of the TOV equation with relativistic matter, for appropriate small radius initial conditions. We survey the formation of a simulated horizon from this point of view. From the numerical solutions, we show that the metric exponent appearing in the TOV equation undergoes an arc tangent-like jump, leading to formation of the simulated horizon. Rescaling the problem to fixed initial radius, we plot the ``phase diagram'' in the initial pressure--initial mass plane, showing the range of parameters where a simulated horizon dynamically forms. Finally, to facilitate further analysis we reformulate the TOV equations in rescaling invariant form .</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in 1-Parameter New General Relativity and their phenomenology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in 1-parameter New General Relativity (NGR), a specific theory in teleparallel gravity which is constructed from the three possible quadratic scalars obtained from torsion with arbitrary coefficients satisfying the requirements for the absence of ghosts. In this class of modified theories of gravity, the observable effects of gravity result from the torsion rather than the curvature of the spacetime. Unlike in GR, where the fundamental quantity is the metric from which the Levi-Civita connection is derived, in teleparallel theories of gravity the fundamental variable is the tetrad, from which one constructs the metric and the teleparallel connection. We consider the most general tetrad for spherical symmetry and we derive the corresponding field equations. Under adequate assumptions, we find three different branches of vacuum solutions and discuss their associated phenomenology. In particular, we analyze the photon sphere, the classical tests of GR such as the light deflection, the Shapiro delay, and the perihelion shift, and also the Komar mass, while providing a detailed comparison with their Schwarzschild spacetime counterparts. Finally, we analyze how the observational imprints from accretion disks and shadows are affected in comparison with their GR counterparts, and conclude that the free parameters of the model might induce additional attractive or repulsive effects to the propagation of photons, depending on their values.</description>

      <title>Field transformations and invariant quantities in scalar-teleparallel theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study transformations of the dynamical fields - a metric, a flat affine connection and a scalar field - in scalar-teleparallel gravity theories. The theories we study belong either to the general teleparallel setting, where no further condition besides vanishing curvature is imposed on the affine connection, or the symmetric or metric teleparallel gravity, where one also imposes vanishing torsion or nonmetricity, respectively. For each of these three settings, we find a general class of scalar-teleparallel action functionals which retain their form under the aforementioned field transformations. This is achieved by generalizing the constraint of vanishing torsion or nonmetricity to non-vanishing, but algebraically constrained torsion or nonmetricity. We find a number of invariant quantities which characterize these theories independently of the choice of field variables, and relate these invariants to analogues of the conformal frames known from scalar-curvature gravity. Using these invariants, we are able to identify a number of physically relevant subclasses of scalar-teleparallel theories. We also generalize our results to multiple scalar fields, and speculate on further extended theories with non-vanishing, but algebraically constrained curvature.</description>

      <title>Shadows and weak gravitational lensing by the black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a charged black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMS) theory. We evaluate the shadow cast by the black hole and obtain analytical solutions for both the radius of the photon sphere and the shadow radius. We observe that the black hole parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ both influence the shadow of black hole. It is shown that the photon sphere and the shadow radius increase as a consequence of the presence of parameter $\gamma$. Interestingly, we show that shadow radius decreases first and then remains unchanged due to the impact of parameter $\beta$. Finally, we consider the weak gravitational lensing and the total magnification of lensed images around black hole. We find that the black hole charge and parameter $\beta$ both give rise to a significant effect, reducing the deflection angle. Similarly, the same behavior for the total magnification is observed due to the effect of black hole charge and parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Charged Black Holes with Yukawa Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study derives a novel family of charged black hole solutions featuring short- and long-range modifications. These ones are achieved through a Yukawa-like gravitational potential modification and a nonsingular electric potential incorporation. The short-range corrections encode quantum gravity effects, while the long-range adjustments simulate gravitational effects akin to those attributed to dark matter. Our investigation reveals that the total mass of the black hole undergoes corrections owing to the apparent presence of dark matter mass and the self-adjusted electric charge mass. Two distinct solutions are discussed: a regular black hole solution characterizing small black holes, where quantum effects play a crucial role, and a second solution portraying large black holes at considerable distances, where the significance of Yukawa corrections comes into play. Notably, these long-range corrections contribute to an increase in the total mass and hold particular interest as they can emulate the role of dark matter. Finally, we explore the phenomenological aspects of the black hole. Specifically, we examine the influence of electric charge and Yukawa parameters on thermodynamic quantities, the quasinormal modes for the charged scalar perturbations as well as for the vector perturbations, analysis of the geodesics of light/massive particles, and the accretion of matter onto the charged black hole solution.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior and Joule-Thomson expansion of charged AdS black holes surrounded by exotic fluid with modified Chaplygin equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering the concept of a unified single fluid model, referred to as the modified Chaplygin gas (MCG), which amalgamates dark energy and dark matter. In this study, we explore the thermodynamic characteristics of charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes existing in an unconventional fluid accompanied by MCG. To accomplish this objective, we derive the equations of state by regarding the charge $Q^{2}$ as a thermodynamic variable. The impact of MCG parameters on the critical thermodynamic quantities ($\psi_{c}$, $T_{c}$, $Q_{c}^{2}$) are examined, followed by a detailed analysis of the $Q^{2}-\psi$ diagram. To provide a clearer explanation of the phase transition, we present an analysis of the Gibbs free energy. It is important to note that if the Hawking temperature exceeds the critical temperature, there is a distinct pattern observed known as swallowtail behavior. This indicates that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition from a smaller black hole to a larger one. The critical exponent of the system is found to be in complete agreement with that of the van der Waals fluid system. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of MCG parameters and black hole charge on the Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion in the extended phase space. The J-T coefficient is examined to pinpoint the exact region experiencing cooling or heating, the observation reveals that the presence of negative heat capacity results in the occurrence of a cooling process. In addition, it is worth noting that the certain parameters exert a significant influence on the ratio $\frac{T_{min}}{T_{c}}$. The parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ have a non-negligible effect on the isenthalpy curve.</description>

      <title>On the integrability of extended test body dynamics around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, the motion of an extended test body is influenced by its proper rotation, or spin. We present a covariant and physically self-consistent Hamiltonian framework to study this motion, up to quadratic order in the body's spin, including a spin-induced quadrupole, and in an arbitrary background spacetime. The choice of spin supplementary condition and degeneracies associated with local Lorentz invariance are treated rigorously with adapted tools from Hamiltonian mechanics. Applying the formalism to a background space-time described by the Kerr metric, we prove that the motion of any test compact object around a rotating black hole defines an integrable Hamiltonian system to linear order in the body's spin. Moreover, this integrability still holds at quadratic order in spin when the compact object has the deformability expected for an isolated black hole. Our analytical results shed light on longstanding numerical conjectures regarding spin-induced chaos in the motion of asymmetric compact binaries, and provides a powerful framework to improve current gravitational waveform modelling to account for spin-induced extended body effects.</description>

      <title>On geometrical origin of Kodama vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that warped product spacetimes such as spherically symmetric ones admit the Kodama vector. This vector provides a locally conserved current made by contraction of the Einstein tensor, even though there is no Killing vector. In addition, a quasilocal mass, Birkhoff's theorem and various properties are closely related to the Kodama vector. Recently, it is shown that the notion of the Kodama vector can be extended to three-dimensional axisymmetric spacetimes even if the spacetimes are not warped product. This implies that warped product may not be a necessary condition for a spacetime to admit the Kodama vector. We show properties of the Kodama vector originate from the conformal Killing-Yano two-form. In particular, the well-known spacetimes that admit the Kodama vector have a closed conformal Killing-Yano two-form. Furthermore, we show the Kodama vector provides local conserved currents for each order of the Lovelock tensor as well as the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Reparametrization Symmetry of Local Entropy Production on a Dynamical Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that for a dynamical black hole in any higher derivative theory of gravity, one could construct a spatial entropy current, characterizing the in/outflow of entropy at every point on the horizon, as long as the dynamics of the amplitude is small enough. However, the construction is very much dependent on how we choose the spatial slicing of the horizon along its null generators. In this note, we have shown that though both the entropy density and the spatial entropy current change non-trivially under a reparametrization of the null generator, the net entropy production, which is given by the `time' derivative of entropy density plus the divergence of the spatial current is invariant. We have explicitly verified this claim for the particular case of dynamical black holes Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part I. Limits on orientable Euclidean manifolds from circle searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We study (near-)circular orbits of charged particles in the background of charged black holes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes of arbitrary dimensionality. We calculate the energy and angular momentum of such particles in a large-radius limit. This allows us to compute the anomalous dimension of the dual charged double-twist operators in a large-spin expansion, making a prediction for the bootstrap analysis at large charge and spin. We relate our result to the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) for AdS black holes of all sizes. We also discuss the relation of WGC with the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Exploring Time Delay Interferometry Ranging as a Practical Ranging Approach in the Bayesian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is an indispensable step in the whole data processing procedure of space-based gravitational wave detection, as it mitigates the overwhelming laser frequency noise, which would otherwise completely bury the gravitational wave signals. Knowledge on the inter-spacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of TDI. Conventional method for inter-spacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudo-random noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information, it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as cross-validations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative data-driven approach - time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR) - as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research, our TDIR algorithm significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem and employing a general polynomial parametrization, we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises, the estimated median values of delays are only 5.28 ns away from the ground truths, capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Additionally, we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR, and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas Models in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Utilizing Late-time Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our aim is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r_{d}$). We utilize late-time datasets: 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points, along with the latest determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter offers several advantages, including mitigating bias, enhancing precision, and improving compatibility with various datasets. By introducing random correlations in the covariance matrix during simulation, errors are effectively reduced. Our estimated values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and $r_{d}$ consistently align with measurements from both the Planck and SDSS experiments. Cosmographic tests provide valuable insights into the dynamics of various cosmological models, enriching our understanding of cosmic evolution. Statefinder diagnostics offer deeper insights into cosmic expansion dynamics, aiding in distinguishing between cosmological frameworks. Furthermore, the $o_{m}$ diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls into the phantom region, while GCCM falls into the quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) support all models, indicating plausible explanations. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit. Validation via the reduced $\chi_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, reinforcing their credibility.</description>
