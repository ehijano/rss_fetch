      <title>Superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric rhombohedral NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal stacking offers a powerful yet underexplored route to engineer symmetry in layered superconductors. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral-stacked NbSe2 (3R-NbSe2), a non-centrosymmetric polytype in which global inversion symmetry is removed by stacking alone. Using comprehensive structural, transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic measurements, we establish superconductivity as a bulk property of the 3R phase and find that the in-plane upper critical field exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating the persistence of strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. Unlike the thickness-dependent superconductivity in centrosymmetric 2H-NbSe2, the superconducting transition temperature in 3R-NbSe2 shows little dependence on layer number but exhibits an unusually strong sensitivity to disorder. We further observe strongly enhanced nonlinear optical and electrical responses near the superconducting transition, consistent with stacking-induced inversion-symmetry breaking. Our results identify 3R-NbSe2 as a single-phase platform in which stacking engineering reshapes superconductivity and enables nonlinear transport phenomena in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced superconductivity in topological insulator Ge2Bi2Te5 and the evolution with Mn doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity (SC) or magnetism into topological insulators (TIs) can give rise to novel quantum states and exotic physical phenomena. Here, we report a high-pressure transport study on the TI Ge2Bi2Te5 and its Mn-doped counterparts. The application of pressure induces a SC in Ge2Bi2Te5, which shows a dome-shape phase diagram with the maximum Tc of 7.6 K at 23 GPa. Doping Mn into Ge2Bi2Te5 introduces an antiferromagnetic order at ambient pressure and strongly weakens the pressure-induced SC, demonstrating that magnetism and SC compete in this material system. Present study provides a new platform for investigating the interplay among band topology, magnetism, and SC.</description>

      <title>Superconducting density of states and vortex lattice of LaRu$_2$P$_2$ observed by Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the superconducting density of states of the iron based superconductor LaRu2P2 (Tc= 4.1 K), measured using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. From the tunneling conductance, we extract a density of states which shows the opening of a s-wave single superconducting gap. The temperature dependence of the gap also follows BCS theory. Under magnetic fields, vortices present Caroli de Gennes Matricon states, although these are strongly broadened by defect scattering. From the vortex core size we obtain a superconducting coherence length of {\xi} = 50 nm, compatible with the value extracted from macroscopic Hc2 measurements. We discuss the comparison between s-wave LaRu2P2 and pnictide unconventional multiple gap and strongly correlated Fe based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermally-Activated Epitaxy of NbO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a thermally-activated epitaxy window for the growth of NbO at temperatures exceeding 1000 $^o$C. NbO films grown in this mode display superior structural and transport properties, which are reproducible across a window of oxygen partial pressure. Through comprehensive analysis, we propose the prototypical electrical properties of NbO, for which a consensus has not yet been made. This study unequivocally demonstrates the utility of high temperatures in the thin film synthesis of refractory metal compounds.</description>

      <title>Reducing TLS loss in tantalum CPW resonators using titanium sacrificial layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Doping-dependent orbital magnetism in Chromium pnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results for the phase diagram of the parent compound LaCrAsO under electron doping using the matrix random-phase approximation. At low doping levels, the system stabilizes an antiferromagnetic state in which different Cr sublattices carry opposite spins, consistent with experimental observations. As the doping concentration increases, a stripe-type antiferromagnetic phase becomes favored. At even higher doping, the system repeats the two former magnetic states, but with incommensurate magnetic ordering vectors. The commensurate magnetic phases are associated with more localized electrons in the Cr $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, whereas the incommensurate phases are linked to the $d_{xy}$ orbital, whose stronger overlap favors itinerant-electron magnetism.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Fermion Interactions in BCS Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</description>

      <title>Orbital Ordering in the Charge Density Wave Phases of BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use resonant X-ray scattering at the nickel L$_{2,3}$ edges to investigate the interplay between orbital degrees of freedom and charge density waves (CDW) in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. Both the incommensurate and commensurate CDWs in this system exhibit strong resonant enhancement with distinct energy and polarization dependencies, indicative of orbital ordering. Azimuthal-angle-dependent measurements reveal a lowering of the local Ni site symmetry, consistent with monoclinic or lower point group symmetry. The scattering signatures of both CDWs are dominated by contributions from Ni $d_{xz,yz}$ orbitals, with similar orbital character despite their distinct wave vectors. These findings point to a shared orbital-driven formation mechanism and provide new insight into the symmetry breaking and orbital/nematic fluctuations in the high-temperature regime of the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>The microwave phase locking in Bloch transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08692v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental demonstration of the quantum coherent phase slip and current quantization in the superconductors, the fundamental phenomena dual to the coherent Cooper pair tunnelling and voltage quantization (Shapiro steps), enables the development of a new quantum device, the Bloch transistor (BT). BT has a unique functionality: it can deliver quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit. BT consists of two coupled Josephson Junctions (JJ) in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. At the heart of the BT operation is a new mechanism for phase-locking the Bloch oscillations in JJs to microwaves via induced charge. The charge phase locking allows not only quantization of current but also gate voltage control of this quantisation through the Aharonov-Casher effect. We study the operation of the BT and analyse its parameters. BT technology is scalable and compatible with other superconducting quantum devices, making it part of an emerging cryogenic quantum technology platform</description>

      <title>Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.</description>
