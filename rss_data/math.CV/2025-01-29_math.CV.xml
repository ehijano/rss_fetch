      <title>Log truncated threshold and zero mass conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For plurisubharmonic functions $\varphi$ and $\psi$ lying in the Cegrell class of $\mathbb{B}^n$ and $\mathbb{B}^m$ respectively such that the Lelong number of $\varphi$ at the origin vanishes, we show that the mass of the origin with respect to the measure $(dd^c\max\{\varphi(z), \psi(Az)\})^n$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ is zero for $A\in \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{C}^n,\mathbb{C}^m)=\mathbb{C}^{nm}$ outside a pluripolar set. For a plurisubharmonic function $\varphi$ near the origin in $\mathbb{C}^n$, we introduce a new concept coined the log truncated threshold of $\varphi$ at $0$ which reflects a singular property of $\varphi$ via a log function near the origin (denoted by $lt(\varphi,0)$) and derive an optimal estimate of the residual Monge-Amp\`ere mass of $\varphi$ at $0$ in terms of its higher order Lelong numbers $\nu_j(\varphi)$ at $0$ for $1\leq j\leq n-1$, in the case that $lt(\varphi,0)&lt;\infty$. These results provide a new approach to the zero mass conjecture of Guedj and Rashkovskii, and unify and strengthen well-known results about this conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Pluripotential Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for the Complex Monge-Amp\`ere flow with a general measure on the right-hand side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the pluripotential Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere flow is solvable for the right-hand side of the form $dt \wedge d\mu$ where $d\mu$ is dominated by a Monge-Amp\`ere measure of a bounded plurisubharmonic function. In particular, we remove the strict positivity assumption on $d\mu$. We use this result to prove the parabolic version of the bounded subsolution theorem due to Kolodziej in pluripotential theory.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of nondegenerate hypo-analytic structures of hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth, non-degenerate locally integrable structure of hypersurface type on a manifold $M$, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be equivalent, near a point, to a real-analytic locally integrable structure (the analytic regularizability), generalizing a recent result of Zaitsev and the first author.
  First, we discover, in our setting, a (previously unknown) invariant CR submanifold $\Sigma$ in $M$ of hypersurface type, which we call the central submanifold. We prove that the analytic regularizability of $M$ is equivalent to that of the associated CR manifold $\Sigma$. Furthermore, as a byproduct of our construction, we show that the central manifold construction reduces the whole (smooth or analytic) equivalence problem for nondegenerate structures with the Levi positivity condition to that of the associated central manifolds, i.e. to CR geometry.
  Second, we make use of a classical construction due to Marson and show that sufficient for the analytic regularizability of $M$ is the analytic regularizability of the CR manifold $\tilde M$ associated with $M$ in the sense of Marson.
  We show applications of both regularizability conditions to classes of locally integrable structures.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Bohr radii for holomorphic functions with values in complex Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to answer certain open questions related to the exact values of multidimensional Bohr radii by using the concept of arithmetic Bohr radius for holomorphic functions defined in complete Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with values in complex Banach spaces. More specifically, for holomorphic functions with values in arbitrary complex Banach spaces, we explore the asymptotic estimates of the arithmetic Bohr radius in the unit ball of $\ell^n_q$ $(1\leq q\leq \infty)$ spaces. As an application, we obtain the exact value of multidimensional Bohr radius for the unit ball in $\ell^n_1$ spaces which improves the previously known result of Aizenberg.</description>

      <title>On fields of meromorphic functions on neighborhoods of rational curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $F$ is a smooth and connected complex surface (not necessarily compact) containing a smooth rational curve with positive self-intersection. We prove that if there exists a non-constant meromorphic function on $F$, then the field of meromorphic functions on $F$ is isomorphic to the field of rational functions in one or two variables over $\mathbb C$.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic motions, natural families of entire maps, and multiplier-like objects for wandering domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural stability of holomorphic functions has been the subject of much research in the last fifty years. Due to various technicalities, however, most of that work has focused on so-called finite-type functions (functions whose set of singular values has finite cardinality). Recent developments in the field go beyond this setting. In this paper we extend Eremenko and Lyubich's result on natural families of entire maps to the case where the set of singular values is not the entire complex plane, showing under this assumption that the set $M_f$ of entire functions quasiconformally equivalent to $f$ admits the structure of a complex manifold (of possibly infinite dimension). Moreover, we will consider functions with wandering domains -- another hot topic of research in complex dynamics. Given an entire function $f$ with a simply connected wandering domain $U$, we construct an analogue of the multiplier of a periodic orbit, called a distortion sequence, and show that, under some hypotheses, the distortion sequence moves analytically as $f$ moves within appropriate parameter families.</description>

      <title>Is every triangle a trajectory of an elliptical billiard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named "Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>
