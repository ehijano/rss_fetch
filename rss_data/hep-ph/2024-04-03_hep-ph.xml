      <title>Analysis of Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global fit to the experimental data of two-body charmed baryon decays based on the topological diagrammatic approach (TDA) and take into account the phase shifts between $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes as inspired by the recent BESIII measurement of the decay asymmetry in the decay $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0K^+$. The TDA has the advantage that it is more intuitive, graphic and easier to implement model calculations. The measured branching fractions and decay asymmetries are well accommodated in the TDA except for a few modes, in particular, the predicted ${\cal B}(\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^-\pi^+)=(2.83\pm0.10)\%$ is larger than its current value. The equivalence of the TDA and the irreducible SU(3) approach (IRA) is established. We show that the number of the minimum set of tensor invariants in the IRA and the topological amplitudes in the TDA is the same and present their relations. The predicted magnitudes of $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes and their phase shifts are presented for measured and yet-to-be-measured modes in both the TDA and IRA which can be tested in the near future. Besides the decay $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$, there exist several modes which proceed only through $W$-exchange. In particular, the observed channel $\Xi_c^0\to \Sigma^+ K^-$ should have phase shifts similar to that in $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$ and its decay asymmetry is predicted to be $-0.21\pm0.17$ which can be used to test our theoretical framework. In contrast, the TDA leads to a large $\alpha$ of order $-0.93$ for the decay $\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0\pi^+$ even after the phase-shift effect is incorporated in the fit.</description>

      <title>SMEFT Matching to $Z^\prime$ Models at Dimension-8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral gauge bosons arise in many motivated models of Beyond the Standard Model Physics. Experimental searches require that such gauge bosons are above the TeV scale in most models which means that the tools of effective field theories, in particular the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), are useful. We match the SMEFT to models with heavy $Z^\prime$ bosons, including effects of dimension-8 operators, and consider the restrictions on model parameters from electroweak precision measurements and from Drell Yan invariant mass distributions and forward-backward asymmetry, $A_\text{FB}$, measurements at the LHC. The results demonstrate the model dependence of the resulting limits on SMEFT coefficients and the relatively small impact of including dimension-8 matching. In all cases, the limits from invariant mass distributions are stronger than from $A_\text{FB}$ measurements in the $Z^\prime$ models we consider.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 2: Substructure and the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a large and growing interest in observations of small-scale structure in dark matter. We propose a new way to probe dark matter structures in the $\sim 10 - 10^8 \, M_\odot$ range. This allows us to constrain the primordial power spectrum over shorter distances scales than possible with direct observations from the CMB. For $k$ in the range $\sim 10 - 1000 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ our constraints on the power spectrum are orders of magnitude stronger than previous bounds.
  We also set some of the strongest constraints on dark matter isocurvature perturbations. Our method relies on the heating effect such dark matter substructures would have on the distribution of stars in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Many models of inflation produce enhanced power at these short distance scales and can thus be constrained by our observation. Further, many dark matter models such as axion dark matter, self-interacting dark matter and dissipative dark matter, produce dense structures which could be constrained this way.</description>

      <title>Inferring flavor mixtures in multijet events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multijet events with heavy-flavors are of central importance at the LHC since many relevant processes -- such as $t\bar t$, $hh$, $t\bar t h$ and others -- have a preferred branching ratio for this final state. Current techniques for tackling these processes use hard-assignment selections through $b$-tagging working points, and suffer from systematic uncertainties because of the difficulties in Monte Carlo simulations. We develop a flexible Bayesian mixture model approach to simultaneously infer $b$-tagging score distributions and the flavor mixture composition in the dataset. We model multidimensional jet events, and to enhance estimation efficiency, we design structured priors that leverages the continuity and unimodality of the $b$-tagging score distributions. Remarkably, our method eliminates the need for a parametric assumption and is robust against model misspecification -- It works for arbitrarily flexible continuous curves and is better if they are unimodal. We have run a toy inferential process with signal $bbbb$ and backgrounds $bbcc$ and $cccc$, and we find that with a few hundred events we can recover the true mixture fractions of the signal and backgrounds, as well as the true $b$-tagging score distribution curves, despite their arbitrariness and nonparametric shapes. We discuss prospects for taking these findings into a realistic scenario in a physics analysis. The presented results could be a starting point for a different and novel kind of analysis in multijet events, with a scope competitive with current state-of-the-art analyses. We also discuss the possibility of using these results in general cases of signals and backgrounds with approximately known continuous distributions and/or expected unimodality.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of hot relativistic plasma in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot QED plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis utilized the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation obtained recently. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit a scaling behavior given by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (here $T$ denotes the temperature and $B$ the magnetic field). As $|eB|/T^2$ increases, both conductivities initially decrease, reach minima, and then exhibit growths when the lowest Landau level dominates. However, the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter. Additionally, we extend our analysis to a magnetized quark-gluon plasma, although the approximation's validity breaks down in QCD at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight particles are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates. In the vicinity of the solar system, these ultralight particles are described as a superposition of plane waves, resulting in a stochastic field with amplitude fluctuations on scales determined by the velocity dispersion of dark matter. In this work, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave interferometers to the stochastic ultralight dark matter field within the frequentist framework. We derive the projected sensitivity of a single detector using the time-delay interferometry and find that the stochastic effect will only diminish the performance of the detector marginally, unlike searches in other contexts where significant reductions are found. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of detector network in two typical configurations. We find that the well-separated configuration, where the distance between two detectors exceeds the coherence length of dark matter, is the optimal choice for ultralight dark matter detection due to a less chance of missing signal. This contrasts with the detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background, where the co-located and co-aligned configuration is preferred. Our results may provide useful insights for potential joint observations involving gravitational-wave detectors like LISA, Taiji and TianQin.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy hadrons production in ultraperipheral collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the double heavy baryon $\Xi_{QQ'}$ and tetraquark $T_{QQ}$ production through photon-photon and photon-gluon fusion via ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC and FCC within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD factorization formalism. Various ion-ion collisions are taken into account, two cc(bb)-diquark configurations ($[cc(bb),{^3S_1}\mbox{-}\bar{\bm{3}}]$ and $[cc(bb),{^1S_0}\mbox{-}\bm{6}]$) and four bc-diquark configurations ($[bc,{^3S_1}\mbox{-}\bar{\bm{3}}]$, $[bc,{^3S_1}\mbox{-}\bm{6}]$, $[bc,{^1S_0}\mbox{-}\bar{\bm{3}}]$ and $[bc,{^1S_0}\mbox{-}\bm{6}]$) are considered in the calculation. Numerical results indicate that the $[cc,{^3S_1}\mbox{-}\bar{\bm{3}}]$ diquark provides dominant contribution for $\Xi_{cc}$ ($T_{cc}$) production, and a considerable number of $\Xi_{cc}$ ($T_{cc}$) can be produced. Due to the event topologies for ultraperipheral collision are very clear, the background from various QCD interactions can be suppressed, hence the experimental investigation for $\Xi_{cc}$ and $T_{cc}$ are feasible. The productions for $\Xi_{bc/bb}$ are also discussed, leaving only slightly possibility for $\Xi_{bc}$ through photon-gluon fusion with ultraperipheral collisions at the FCC.</description>

      <title>The resonance effect for the CP asymmetry associated with the process $\omega \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct CP asymmetry in the weak decay process of hadrons is commonly attributed to the weak phase of the CKM matrix and the indeterminate strong phase. We propose a way of creating a strong phase difference between two decay paths involving vector mesons $V= \omega,\rho$ decaying to $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ considering the G-parity suppressed decay process $\rho^{0} \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0} $. It can lead to a significant CP asymmetry in the interference region. We consider the effects of $\omega$ and $\rho$ mixing on their decays to $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$. Meanwhile, we calculate the CP asymmetry for the process $B\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}P$ (P refers to pseudoscalar meson) through $\omega(\rho) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$. Besides, we also calculate the integral results of different phase space regions. We hope that our work can help provide some theoretical guidance for future experimental studies of CP asymmetry in these decays.</description>

      <title>Semi-leptonic $W$ decay to $B$ meson with lepton pairs in HQET factorization upto $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of heavy-light meson production within the framework of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) factorization, we extend the factorization formalism for rather a complicated process $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ in the limit of non-zero invariant squared-mass of dilepton, $q^2$, at the lowest order in $1/m_b$ up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$. The purpose of the current study is to extend the HQET factorization formula for the $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process and subsequently compute the form factors for this channel up to next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections in $\alpha_s$. We explicitly show the amplitude of the $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process can also be factorized into a convolution between the perturbatively calculable hard-scattering kernel and the non-perturbative yet universal light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) defined in HQET. The validity of HQET factorization depends on the assumed scale hierarchy $m_W \sim m_b \gg \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$. Within the HQET framework, we evaluate the form factors associated with the $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process, providing insights into its phenomenology. In addition, we also perform an exploratory phenomenological study on $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ by employing an exponential model for the LCDAs for $B^+$ meson. Our findings reveal that the branching ratio for $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ is below $10^{-10}$. Although the branching ratios are small, this channel in high luminosity LHC experiments may serve to further constraints the value of $\lambda_B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We found good agreement between the experimental data obtained for the polarized Bjorken sum rule and the predictions of analytic QCD, as well as a strong difference between these data and the results obtained in the framework of perturbative QCD. To satisfy the limit of photoproduction and take into account Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn and Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rules, we develope new representation of the perturbative part of the polarized Bjorken sum rule.</description>

      <title>Electric corrections to $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lenghts in the linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we analyze the role of an external electric field, in the weak field approximation, on $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths. The discussion is presented in the frame of the linear sigma model. To achieve this, we take into account all one-loop corrections in the $s$, $t$, and $u$ channels associated with the insertion of a Schwinger propagator for charged pions, focusing on the region characterized by small values of the electric field. Furthermore, one of the novelties of our work is the explicit calculation of box diagrams, which were previously overlooked in discussions regarding magnetic corrections. It turns out that the electric field corrections have an opposite effect with respect to magnetic corrections calculated previously in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos flavour composition as a probe of neutrino magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic magnetic field is considered. To describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations on the galactic scale baselines an approach using wave packets is developed. Evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic field are derived. Analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to wave packet separation are obtained for the case of uniform magnetic field. It is shown that for oscillations on magnetic frequencies $\omega_i^B = \mu_i B_\perp$ the coherence lengths that characterizes the damping scale is proportional to the cube of neutrino average momentum $p_0^3$. Probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. Flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.</description>

      <title>Dynamical study of $D^{*}DK$ and $D^{*}D \bar{D}$ systems at quark level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by that Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} Collaboration recently reported $T_{cc}$, which can be interpreted as a molecular $DD^{*}$, we investigated the trihadron system of $T_{cc}$ partner with $IJ^{P}$=$01^{-}$ in the framework of a chiral quark model. It's widely accepted that the main component of $X(3872)$ contains the molecular $\bar{D}D^{*}$, while the main component of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ is molecular $DK$. Based on these three well-known exotic states, $T_{cc} (DD^{*})$, $X(3872) (\bar{D}D^{*})$ and $D_{s0}^{*}(2317) (DK)$, we dynamically investigate $D^{*}DK$ and $DD^{*}\bar{D}$ systems at quark level to search for possible bound states. The results show that both of them are bound states, in which the binding energy of the molecular state $DD^*K$ is relatively small, only 0.8 MeV, while the binding energy of $DD^*\bar{D}$ is up to 1.9 MeV. According to the calculation results of the Root-square-mean distances, the spatial structure of the two systems shows obvious ($DD^*$)-($\bar{D}$/$K$) structure, in which $D$ is close to $D^*$ while $DD^*$ as a whole is relatively distant from the third hadron ($\bar{D}$/$K$), which are similar to the nucleon-electron structure. As a result, we strongly recommend that these bound states $DD^*\bar{D}$ and $DD^*K$ are searched for experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the excess of the muon content of cosmic ray induced extensive air showers (EAS), relative to EAS modeling, observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and by the tension between Auger data and air shower simulations on the maximal muon production depth $X^{\mu}_{\max}$, we investigate the possibility to modify the corresponding EAS simulation results, within the Standard Model of particle physics. We start by specifying the kinematic range for secondary hadron production, which is of relevance for such predictions. We further investigate the impact on the predicted EAS muon number and on $X^{\mu}_{\max}$ of various modifications of the treatment of hadronic interactions, in the framework of the QGSJET-III model, in particular the model calibration to accelerator data, the amount of the "glue" in the pion, and the energy dependence of the pion exchange process. None of the considered modifications of the model allowed us to enhance the EAS muon content by more than 10\%. On the other hand, for the maximal muon production depth, some of the studied modifications of particle production give rise up to $\sim 10$ g/cm$^2$ larger $X^{\mu}_{\max}$ values, which increases the difference with Auger observations.</description>

Abstract: This work aims at assessing the impact of DM self-interactions on the properties of galaxy clusters. In particular, the goal is to study the angular dependence of the cross section by testing rare (large angle scattering) and frequent (small angle scattering) SIDM models with velocity-dependent cross sections. We re-simulate six galaxy cluster zoom-in initial conditions with a dark matter only run and with a full-physics setup simulations that includes a self-consistent treatment of baryon physics. We test the dark matter only setup and the full physics setup with either collisionless cold dark matter, rare self-interacting dark matter, and frequent self-interacting dark matter models. We then study their matter density profiles as well as their subhalo population. Our dark matter only SIDM simlations agree with theoretical models, and when baryons are included in simulations, our SIDM models substantially increase the central density of galaxy cluster cores compared to full-physics simulations using collisionless dark matter. SIDM subhalo suppression in full-physics simulations is milder compared to the one found in dark matter only simulations, because of the cuspier baryionic potential that prevent subhalo disruption. Moreover SIDM with small-angle scattering significantly suppress a larger number of subhaloes compared to large angle scattering SIDM models. Additionally, SIDM models generate a broader range of subhalo concentration values, including a tail of more diffuse subhaloes in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and a population of more compact subhaloes in the cluster cores.</description>

      <title>Upcoming searches for decaying dark matter with ULTRASAT ultraviolet maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) can be tested via different astrophysical and cosmological probes. In particular, particles in the $\sim$ 9.5 - 30 eV mass range that decay into monochromatic photons, would contribute to the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the ultraviolet (UV) bandwidth. In this work, we show that an intriguing improvement to the constraints on such DDM models can come from broadband UV surveys, such as GALEX or the upcoming ULTRASAT satellite. These provide diffuse light maps of the UV EBL, integrated over a wide redshift range. The cross correlation between intensity fluctuations in these maps with a reference spectroscopic galaxy survey, can be used to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the EBL intensity; in this way, it is also possible to detect signatures of contributions from DDM. We forecast the constraining power of (GALEX+ULTRASAT)$\times$DESI, and we show they will be able to detect DDM with decay rate up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-26}\,{\rm s})$. In the context of axion-like particles (ALP), our forecasts can be converted to constraints on the ALP-photon coupling; our results show this technique will test ALP with coupling $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}})$, more than an order of magnitude better than current bounds in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

      <title>The radiative decay of scalar glueball from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice QCD study on the radiative decay of the scalar glueball to the vector meson $\phi$ in the quenched approximation. The calculations are carried out on three gauge ensembles with different lattice spaicings, which enable us to do the continuum extrapolation. We first revisit the radiative $J/\psi$ decay into the scalar glueball $G$ and obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma(J/\psi \to \gamma G)=0.449(44)~\text{keV}$ and the branching fraction $\text{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma G) = 4.8(5)\times 10^{-3}$, which are in agreement with the previous lattice results. We then extend the similar calculation to the process $G\to \gamma \phi$ and get the partial decay width $\Gamma(G \to \gamma \phi)= 0.074(47)~\text{keV}$, which implies that the combined branching fraction of $J/\psi\to\gamma G\to \gamma\gamma\phi$ is as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$ such that this process is hardly detected by the BESIII experiment even with the large $J/\psi$ sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$. With the vector meson dominance model, the two-photon decay width of the scalar glueball is estimated to be $\Gamma(G\to\gamma\gamma)=0.53(46)~\text{eV}$, which results in a large stickiness $S(G)\sim \mathcal{O}(10^4)$ of the scalar glueball by assuming the stickiness of $f_2(1270)$ to be one.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$), while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point neutron star observations, while maintaining agreement with laboratory data, in a model independent way. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can help constrain the finite $T$ equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions in a well-controlled manner without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\sim1-2 \ n_{\rm sat}$) within $5\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. We investigate the sources of numerical and theoretical uncertainty and discuss future directions of study.</description>

Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <title>BOSS Constraints on Massive Particles during Inflation: The Cosmological Collider in Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive particles leave imprints on primordial non-Gaussianity via couplings to the inflaton, even despite their exponential dilution during inflation: practically, the Universe acts as a Cosmological Collider. We present the first dedicated search for spin-zero particles using BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, as well as Planck CMB non-Gaussianity data. We demonstrate that some Cosmological Collider models are well approximated by the standard equilateral and orthogonal parametrization; assuming negligible inflaton self-interactions, this facilitates us translating Planck non-Gaussianity constraints into bounds on Collider models. Many models have signatures that are not degenerate with equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianity and thus require dedicated searches. Here, we constrain such models using BOSS three-dimensional redshift-space galaxy clustering data, focusing on spin-zero particles in the principal series and constraining their couplings to the inflaton at varying speed and mass, marginalizing over the unknown inflaton self-interactions. This is made possible through an improvement in Cosmological Bootstrap techniques and the combination of perturbation theory and halo occupation distribution models for galaxy clustering. Our work sets the standard for inflationary spectroscopy with cosmological observations, providing the ultimate link between physics on the largest and smallest scales.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spin Polarization of Heavy Quarks in Magnetic Fields and Hot Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions give rise to the formation of both deconfined QCD matter and a strong magnetic field. The spin of heavy quarks is influenced by interactions with the external magnetic field as well as by random scatterings with thermal light partons. The presence of QCD matter comprising charged quarks can extend the lifetime and strength of the magnetic field, thereby enhancing the degree of heavy quark polarization. However, the random scatterings with QCD matter tend to diminish heavy quark polarization. In this study, we utilize the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation to investigate both these contributions. Taking into account the realistic evolutions of medium temperatures and the in-medium magnetic fields at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we observe that heavy quark polarization is limited by the short lifetime of the magnetic field and the high temperatures of the medium. Furthermore, we explore the mass dependence of quark polarization, revealing that the polarization degree of strange quarks is much larger than that of charm quarks.</description>

Abstract: Six $C$-even states, denoted as $X$, with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, $1^{\pm+}$, or $2^{\pm+}$, are searched for via the $e^+e^-\to\gamma D_{s}^{\pm}D_{s}^{*\mp}$ process using $(1667.39\pm8.84)~\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring at center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=(4681.92\pm0.30)~\mathrm{MeV}$. No statistically significant signal is observed in the mass range from $4.08$ to $4.32~\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}$. The upper limits of $\sigma[e^+e^-\to\gamma X]\cdot \mathcal{B}[X \to D_{s}^{\pm}D_{s}^{*\mp}]$ at a $90\%$ confidence level are determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation and study the possibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit Hilbert space in one of larger dimension. The results are illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Tightening the reins on non-minimal dark sector physics: Interacting Dark Energy with dynamical and non-dynamical equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reassessment of the state of Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) cosmology, namely models featuring a non-gravitational interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). To achieve high generality, we extend the dark sector physics by considering two different scenarios: a non-dynamical DE equation of state $w_0\neq-1$, and a dynamical $w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. In both cases, we distinguish two different physical regimes resulting from a phantom or quintessence equation of state. To circumvent early-time superhorizon instabilities, the energy-momentum transfer should occur in opposing directions within the two regimes, resulting in distinct phenomenological outcomes. We study quintessence and phantom non-dynamical and dynamical models in light of two independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments - the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We analyze CMB data both independently and in combination with Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Our results update and extend the state-of-the-art analyses, significantly narrowing the parameter space allowed for these models and limiting their overall ability to reconcile cosmological tensions. Although considering different combinations of data leaves some freedom to increase $H_0$ towards the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration, our most constraining dataset (CMB+BAO+SN) indicates that fully reconciling the tension solely within the framework of IDE remains challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose an observationally and theoretically consistent resolution of the cosmological constant problem: $\Lambda$ is a counterterm - with a running coupling - that balances the monopole celestial sky average of the kinetic energy of expansion of inhomogeneously distributed `small' cosmic voids. No other dark energy source is required. This solution relies on the first investigation of void statistics in cosmological simulations in full general relativity (arXiv:2403.15134). Results are consistent with parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction. Crucially, dynamical spatial curvature arises as time-varying spatial gradients of the kinetic spatial curvature, and depends directly on the void volume fraction. Its monopole average generates the cosmological term. This result potentially resolves the Hubble tension and offers new approaches to tackling other tensions and anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Local Analytic Sector Subtraction scheme to construct a completely analytic set of expressions implementing a fully local infrared subtraction at NNLO for generic coloured massless final states. The cancellation of all explicit infrared poles appearing in the double-virtual contribution, in the real-virtual correction and in the integrated local infrared counterterms is explicitly verified, and all finite contributions arising from integrated local counterterms are analytically evaluated in terms of ordinary polylogarithms up to weight three. The resulting subtraction formula can readily be implemented in any numerical framework containing the relevant matrix elements up to NNLO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in the center of galaxies, although the origin of their massive seeds is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the SMBHs formation from the QCD axion bubbles. In this case, the primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered as the seeds of SMBHs, which are generated from the QCD axion bubbles due to an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking after inflation. The QCD axion bubbles are formed when the QCD axion starts to oscillate during the QCD phase transition. We consider a general case in which the axion bubbles are formed with the bubble effective angle $\theta_{\rm eff}\in(0, \, \pi]$, leading to the minimum PBH mass $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^4-10^7)M_\odot$ for the axion decay constant $f_a\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{16})\, \rm GeV$. The PBHs at this mass region may account for the seeds of SMBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explored the gravity dual of a rotating quark-gluon plasma by transforming the boundary coordinates of the large black hole limit of Schwarchild-$\text{AdS}_5$ metric. The Euler-Lagrange equation of the Nambu-Goto action and its solution become more complex than those without rotation. For small angular velocity, we obtained an analytical form of the drag force acting on a quark moving in the direction of the rotation axis and found it stronger than that without rotation. We also calculated the heavy quark potential under the same approximation. For the quarkonium symmetric with respect to the rotation axis, the depth of the potential is reduced by the rotation. For the quarkonium oriented in parallel to the rotation axis, the binding force is weakened and the force range becomes longer. We also compared our holographic formulation with others in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We provide the corrected calculation of the muon g-2 in non-local QED previously done in the literature. In specific, we show the proper technique for calculating loops in non-local QED and use it to find the form factors F1(q1) and F2(q2) in non-local QED. We also utilize this technique to calculate some novel results in non-local QED, including calculating the correction to the photon self-energy, the modification to the classical Coulomb potential, the modification to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, and the contribution to the Lamb shift. We also discuss charge dequantization through non-locality, and show that the experimental bounds on the electric charge on Dirac neutrinos, translate into strong flavor-dependent bounds on the scale on non-locality that range between 10^5 - 10^10 TeV. We also discuss the inconsistencies of unrenormalized non-local Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) and the need for renormalizing them, even when they are free from UV divergences.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in the constituent quark model using diffusion Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the diffusion Monte Carlo method to calculate the doubly heavy tetraquark $T_{cc}$ system in two kinds of constituent quark models, the pure constituent quark model AL1/AP1 and the chiral constituent quark model. When the discrete configurations are complete and no spatial clustering is preseted, the AL1/AP1 model gives an energy of $T_{cc}$ close to the $DD^*$ threshold, and the chiral constituent quark model yields a deeply bound state. We further calculate all doubly heavy tetraquark systems with $J^P=0^+,1^+,2^+$, and provide the binding energies of systems with bound states. The $I(J^P)=0(0^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $\frac{1}{2}(1^+)$ $bb\bar{s}\bar{n}$ systems have bound states in all three models. Since the DMC method has almost no restriction on the spatial part, the resulting bound states have greater binding energies than those obtained in previous works.</description>

Abstract: Gauge/gravity duality is used to study properties of the doubly heavy baryon $(\mathrm{QQq})$ at finite rapidity and temperature in the heavy-ion collision. We investigate the impact of rapidity on string breaking and screening of $\mathrm{QQq}$, and compare these effects with the results for $\rm Q\bar{Q}$ in detail. Computations reveal that the string-breaking distances of $\mathrm{QQq}$ and $\rm Q\bar{Q}$ are close in the confined state and the effects of rapidity and temperature on the string breaking are not significant. An interesting result shows that $\mathrm{QQq}$ cannot be found at high enough temperatures and rapidities; however, $\rm Q\bar{Q}$ can exist under any conditions as long as the separation distance is small enough. Besides, the screening distances of $\mathrm{QQq}$ and $\rm Q\bar{Q}$ are also compared at finite rapidity and temperature. Based on the above analysis, we infer that $\rm Q\bar{Q}$ is more stable than $\mathrm{QQq}$ at finite rapidity and temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Schwinger pair creation of scalar charged particles by a homogeneous electric field in an expanding universe in the quantum kinetic approach. We introduce an adiabatic vacuum for the scalar field based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin solution to the mode equation in conformal time and apply the formalism of Bogolyubov coefficients to derive a system of quantum Vlasov equations for three real kinetic functions. Compared to the analogous system of equations previously reported in the literature, the new one has two advantages. First, its solutions exhibit a faster decrease at large momenta which makes it more suitable for numerical computations. Second, it predicts no particle creation in the case of conformally coupled massless scalar field in the vanishing electric field, i.e., it respects the conformal symmetry of the system. We identify the ultraviolet divergences in the electric current and energy-momentum tensor of produced particles and introduce the corresponding counterterms in order to cancel them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization of heavy quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is one of the most promising phenomena for understanding the strong interaction. The energy loss and momentum broadening at low momentum can be well described by a stochastic process with drag and diffusion terms. Recent advances in quantum computing, in particular quantum amplitude estimation (QAE), promise to provide a quadratic speed-up in simulating stochastic processes. We introduce and formalize an accelerated quantum circuit Monte-Carlo (aQCMC) framework to simulate heavy quark thermalization. With simplified drag and diffusion coefficients connected by Einstein's relation, we simulate the thermalization of a heavy quark in isotropic and anisotropic mediums using an ideal quantum simulator and compare that to thermal expectations. With Grover-like QAE, we calculate physical observables with quadratically fewer resources, which is a boost over the classical MC simulation that usually requires a large sampling number at the same estimation accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We present DM@NLO, a Fortran 77 based program with a C++ interface dedicated to precision calculations of dark matter (DM) (co)annihilation cross-sections and elastic dark matter-nucleon scattering amplitudes in the Minimal Supersymmetric (SUSY) Standard Model (MSSM) at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative (SUSY) QCD. If the annihilating initial particles carry an electric or colour charge, the Sommerfeld enhanced cross section is included as well and can be matched to the NLO cross section. We review these calculations including technical details relevant for using the code. We illustrate their impact by applying DM@NLO to an example scenario in the constrained MSSM.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the contribution of gluons to single inclusive hadron production at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small $x$ using the Color Glass Condensate formalism. It is shown that the only divergence present is the standard collinear divergence which is absorbed into evolution of gluon-hadron fragmentation function. Our calculations are performed at finite $N_c$ and we provide general finite $N_c$ expressions for the structure of Wilson lines appearing in inclusive dihadron and single hadron production cross sections. We also comment on how one can obtain rapidity distribution of hadron multiplicities from our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that if a dimensionless parameter is tuned to be close to the boundary of the positivity domain and symmetry breaking is driven by a cubic term in the Lagrangian, the scale of the physics of symmetry breaking in a quantum field theory as measured by the Higgs mass can be much greater than the dimensional scales in the classical Lagrangian. Radiative corrections produce large and physically important corrections, helping to stabilize the large VEV. The resulting picture contrasts sharply with the "modern" view of QFT as an effective field theory. I describe how this mechanism might produce the GUT scale in an SU(5) model in which the dimensional parameters in the Lagrangian are at the low scale.</description>

      <title>Global Fit of Electron and Neutrino Elastic Scattering Data to Determine the Strange Quark Contribution to the Vector and Axial Form Factors of the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a global fit of neutral-current elastic (NCE) neutrino-scattering data and parity-violating electron-scattering (PVES) data with the goal of determining the strange quark contribution to the vector and axial form factors of the proton. Previous fits of this form included data from a variety of PVES experiments (PVA4, HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE) and the NCE neutrino and anti-neutrino data from BNL E734. These fits did not constrain the strangeness contribution to the axial form factor $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ very well because there was no NCE data for $Q^2&lt;0.45$ GeV$^2$. Our new fit includes for the first time MiniBooNE NCE data from both neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering; this experiment used a hydrocarbon target and so a model of the neutrino interaction with the carbon nucleus was required. Three different nuclear models have been employed: a relativistic Fermi gas model, the SuperScaling Approximation model, and a spectral function model. We find a tremendous improvement in the constraint of $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ compared to previous work, although more data is needed from NCE measurements that focus on exclusive single-proton final states, for example from MicroBooNE.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today. In fact, a purely kinematic triangle mechanism is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements. We also identify the type of dynamic pole structure that can be misidentified as triangle enhancement. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a single triangle singularity, and is more favored towards a pole-based interpretation based solely on pure line-shape analysis. Lastly, we argue how our method can be used as a model-selection framework to help in classifying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic emission of direct photons from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt {s_{\rm NN}}=200~{\rm GeV}$ with EPOS3 and IP-Glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.08833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observed large elliptic flow ($v_2$) of direct photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions challenges us to explain. In this paper we consider only two sources of direct photons, prompt photons and thermal photons. Prompt photons are calculated with QCD to next leading order, which fits well the spectra at high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm t}$) region. Thermal photons are calculated with AMY rate in a 3+1D viscous hydrodynamical evolution of the collision systems. Two types of initial conditions, EPOS3 and IP-Glasma, are employed. Our results with IP-Glasma initial condition agree with results in published work in most cases, and the difference tells the regions effected by the absence of viscous correction in photon emission rate. Because both models are well constrained with hadron data, the hydrodynamic evolution of collision systems in the two models have many common. However, the transverse velocity of the collective motion are quite different. This makes a big difference in the anisotropic emission of direct photon emission. The observed large elliptic flow of direct photons is reproduced with EPOS3 hydrodynamic evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking from Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically reconsider the argument based on 't Hooft anomaly matching that aims at proving chiral symmetry breaking in 4d QCD-like theories with $N_c&gt;2$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. The main line of reasoning relies on a property of the solutions of the anomaly matching and persistent mass equations called $N_f$-independence. In previous works, the validity of $N_f$-independence was assumed based on qualitative arguments, but it was never proven rigorously. We provide a detailed proof and clarify under which (dynamical) conditions it holds. Our results are valid for a generic spectrum of massless composite fermions including baryons and exotics.</description>

      <title>Collisional flavor swap with neutrino self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos play pivotal roles in determining fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and their observables in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and binary neutron star merger (BNSM). In this paper, we present a novel phenomenon, collisional flavor swap, in which neutrino-matter interactions trigger the complete interchange of neutrino spectra between two different flavors, aided by neutrino self-interactions. We find that a necessary condition to trigger the collisional swap is occurrences of resonance-like collisional flavor instability. In cases where neutrino self-interactions substantially dominate over the collision rate, the collisional swap occurs in the entire neutrino energy spectrum, while intriguing energy dependent features can emerge after the completion of flavor swap. Since flavor swaps correspond to the most extreme case in flavor conversions, they have a great potential to affect CCSN and BNSM phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies in Scalar-Induced Gravitational-Wave Background from Inflaton-Curvaton Mixed Scenario with Sound Speed Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model to generate large anisotropies in the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background via sound speed resonance in the inflaton-curvaton mixed scenario. Cosmological curvature perturbations are not only exponentially amplified at a resonant frequency, but also preserve significant non-Gaussianity of local type described by $f_{\mathrm{nl}}$. Besides a significant enhancement of energy-density fraction spectrum, large anisotropies in SIGWs can be generated, because of super-horizon modulations of the energy density due to existence of primordial non-Gaussianity. A reduced angular power spectrum $\tilde{C}_{\ell}$ could reach an amplitude of $[\ell(\ell+1)\tilde{C}_{\ell}]^{1/2} \sim 10^{-2}$, leading to potential measurements via planned gravitational-wave detectors such as DECIGO. The large anisotropies in SIGWs would serve as a powerful probe of the early universe, shedding new light on the inflationary dynamics, primordial non-Gaussianity, and primordial black hole dark matter.</description>

      <title>A gamma ray study of Galactic PeVatron candidates LHAASO J1825-1236 and J1839-0545</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from these surrounding pulsars. We simulated particle propagation throughout the Galaxy using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. Furthermore, we used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. The findings suggest that CTA may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of axion signal power of dish antennas and dielectric haloscopes using the reciprocity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reciprocity approach is a powerful method to determine the expected signal power of axion haloscopes in a model-independent way. Especially for open and broadband setups like the MADMAX dielectric haloscope the sensitivity to the axion field is difficult to calibrate since they do not allow discrete eigenmode analysis and are optically too large to fully simulate. The central idea of the reciprocity approach is to measure a reflection-induced test field in the setup instead of trying to simulate the axion-induced field. In this article, the reciprocity approach is used to determine the expected signal power of a dish antenna and a minimal dielectric haloscope directly from measurements. The results match expectations from simulation but also include important systematic effects that are too difficult to simulate. In particular, the effect of antenna standing waves and higher order mode perturbations can be quantified for the first time in a dielectric haloscope.</description>

      <title>CDM and SIDM Interpretations of the Strong Gravitational Lensing Object JWST-ER1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: van Dokkum et al. (arXiv:2309.07969) reported the discovery of JWST-ER1, a strong lensing object at redshift $z\approx2$, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope. The lens mass within the Einstein ring is $5.9$ times higher than the expected stellar mass from a Chabrier initial mass function, indicating a high dark matter density. In this work, we show that a cold dark matter halo, influenced by gas-driven adiabatic contraction, can account for the observed lens mass. We interpret the measurement of JWST-ER1 in the self-interacting dark matter scenario and show that the cross section per particle mass $\sigma/m\approx0.1~{\rm cm^2/g}$ is generally favored. Intriguingly, $\sigma/m\approx0.1~{\rm cm^2/g}$ can also be consistent with the strong lensing observations of early-type galaxies at redshift $z\approx0.2$, where adiabatic contraction is not observed overall.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>
