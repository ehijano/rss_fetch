      <title>Weighted theory of Toeplitz operators on the Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weighted compactness and boundedness of Toeplitz operators on the Fock spaces. Fix $\alpha&gt;0$. Let $T_{\varphi}$ be the Toeplitz operator on the Fock space $F^2_{\alpha}$ over $\mathbb{C}^n$ with symbol $\varphi\in L^{\infty}$. For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and any finite sum $T$ of finite products of Toeplitz operators $T_{\varphi}$'s, we show that $T$ is compact on the weighted Fock space $F^p_{\alpha,w}$ if and only if its Berezin transform vanishes at infinity, where $w$ is a restricted $A_p$-weight on $\mathbb{C}^n$. Concerning boundedness, for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, we characterize the $r$-doubling weights $w$ such that $T_{\varphi}$ is bounded on the weighted spaces $L^p_{\alpha,w}$ via a $\varphi$-adapted $A_p$-type condition. Our method also establishes a two weight inequality for the Fock projections in the case of $r$-doubling weights.</description>

      <title>Completeness and additive property for submeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an extended real-valued submeasure $\nu$ defined on a field of subsets $\Sigma$ of a given set, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for which the pseudometric $d_\nu$ defined by $d_{\nu}(A,B):=\min\{1,\nu(A\bigtriangleup B)\}$ for all $A,B \in \Sigma$ is complete. As an application, we show that if $\varphi: \mathcal{P}(\omega)\to [0,\infty]$ is a lower semicontinuous submeasure and $\nu(A):=\lim_n \varphi(A\setminus \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\})$ for all $A\subseteq \omega$, then $d_\nu$ is complete. This includes the case of all weighted upper densities, fixing a gap in a proof by Just and Krawczyk in [Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.~\textbf{285} (1984), 803--816]. In contrast, we prove that if $\nu$ is the upper Banach density (or an upper density greater than or equal to the latter) then $d_\nu$ is not complete.</description>

      <title>Duality Theorems and Vector Measures in Optimal Transportation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal transportation problem, first suggested by Gaspard Monge in the 18th century and later revived in the 1940s by Leonid Kantorovich, deals with the question of transporting a certain measure to another, using transport maps or transport plans that minimize the total cost of transportation. This problem is very popular since it has a variety of applications in economics, physics, computer science and more.
  One of the main tools in this theory is the duality theorem, which states that the optimal total cost equals the value of a different optimization problem called the dual problem.
  In this work, I show how the problem and duality theorem can be generalized to an abstract formulation, in which I omit the use of measures. I show how this generalization implies a wide range of different optimal transport problems, and even other problems from game theory, linear programming and functional analysis.
  In particular, I show how the optimal transport problem can be generalized to deal with vector measures as a result of the abstract theorem and discuss the properties of this problem: I present its corresponding duality theorem and formulate conditions for the existence of transport plans, transport maps and solutions to the dual problem.</description>

      <title>Solutions of differential equations in Freud-weighted Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay some mathematically rigorous foundations for the resolution of differential equations with respect to semi-classical bases and topologies, namely Freud-Sobolev polynomials and spaces. In this quest, we uncover an elegant theory melding various topics in Numerical and Functional Analysis: Poincar\'e inequalities, Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, Painlev\'e equations and more. Brought together, these ingredients allow us to quantify the compactness of Sobolev embeddings on Freud-weighted spaces and finally resolve some differential equations in this topology. As an application, we rigorously and tightly enclose solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with sextic potential.</description>

      <title>Action convergence of general hypergraphs and tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Action convergence provides a limit theory for linear bounded operators $A_n:L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\longrightarrow L^1(\Omega_n)$ where $\Omega_n$ are potentially different probability spaces. This notion of convergence emerged in graph limits theory as it unifies and generalizes many notions of graph limits. We generalize the theory of action convergence to sequences of multi-linear bounded operators $A_n:L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\times \ldots \times L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\longrightarrow L^1(\Omega_n)$. Similarly to the linear case, we obtain that for a uniformly bounded (under an appropriate norm) sequence of multi-linear operators, there exists an action convergent subsequence. Additionally, we explain how to associate different types of multi-linear operators to a tensor and we study the different notions of convergence that we obtain for tensors and in particular for adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. We obtain several hypergraphs convergence notions and we link these with the hierarchy of notions of quasirandomness for hypergraph sequences. This convergence also covers sparse and inhomogeneous hypergraph sequences and it preserves many properties of adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. Moreover, we explain how to obtain a meaningful convergence for sequences of non-uniform hypergraphs and, therefore, also for simplicial complexes. Additionally, we highlight many connections with the theory of dense uniform hypergraph limits (hypergraphons) and we conjecture the equivalence of this theory with a modification of multi-linear action convergence.</description>

      <title>Comparing the ill-posedness for linear operators in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The difficulty for solving ill-posed linear operator equations in Hilbert space is reflected by the strength of ill-posedness of the governing operator, and the inherent solution smoothness. In this study we focus on the ill-posedness of the operator, and we propose a partial ordering for the class of all bounded linear operators which lead to ill-posed operator equations. For compact linear operators, there is a simple characterization in terms of the decay rates of the singular values. In the context of the validity of the spectral theorem the partial ordering can also be understood. We highlight that range inclusions yield partial ordering, and we discuss cases when compositions of compact and non-compact operators occur. Several examples complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory I: pointwise domination and weighted estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to establish some specific quantitative weighted estimates for the generalized commutator of multilinear fractional singular integral operator $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}$ is the focus of this paper, which is defined by $$\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}(\vec{f})(x):= \mathcal{T}_{\eta}\left((b_1(x) - b_1)^{\beta_1}f_1,\ldots,(b_m(x) - b_m)^{\beta_m}f_m\right)(x),$$ where $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}$ is a multilinear fractional singular integral operator, ${\bf b}:=({b_1}, \cdots ,{b_m})$ is a set of symbol functions, and $({\beta_1}, \cdots ,{\beta_m}) \in {\mathbb{N}_0^m}$.
  Pointwise dominating the aforementioned commutator leads us to consider a class of higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator ${\mathcal A}_{\eta ,\mathcal{S},\tau}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$ to achieve this long-cherished wish. Therefore, it suffices to construct its quantitative weighted estimates, which firstly include the characterization of several types of multilinear weighted conditions $A_{\vec p,q}^*$, $W_{\vec p,q}^\infty$, and $H_{\vec p,q}^\infty$. Within the scope of this work, Bloom type estimate for first order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator is established herein. Moreover, we derive two distinct Bloom type estimates for higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator by using "maximal weight method" and "iterated weight method" respectively, which not only refines some of Lerner's methods but greatly enhances the generality of our conclusions. Endpoint quantitative estimates for multilinear fractional singular integral operators and their first order commutators are also obtained as the last main result. It is also worthy of highlighting that some important multilinear fractional operators are applicable to our results as applications.</description>
