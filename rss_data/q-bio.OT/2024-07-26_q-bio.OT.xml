      <title>When Life Gives You Lemons, Squeeze Your Way Through: Understanding Citrus Avoidance Behaviour by Free-Ranging Dogs in India</title>

Abstract: Palatability of food is driven by multiple factors like taste, smell, texture, freshness, etc. and can be very variable across species. There are classic examples of local adaptations leading to speciation, driven by food availability. Urbanization across the world is causing rapid decline of biodiversity, while also driving local adaptations in some species. Free-ranging dogs are an interesting example of adaptation to a human-dominated environment across varied habitats. They have co-existed with humans for centuries and are a perfect model system for studying local adaptations. We attempted to understand a specific aspect of their scavenging behaviour in India: citrus aversion. Pet dogs are known to avoid citrus fruits and food contaminated by them. In India, lemons are used widely in the cuisine, and discarded in the garbage. Hence, free-ranging dogs, that typically are scavengers of human leftovers, are likely to encounter lemons and lemon-contaminated food on a regular basis. We carried out a population level experiment to test response of free-ranging dogs to chicken contaminated with various parts of lemon. The dogs avoided chicken contaminated with lemon juice the most. Further, when provided with chicken dipped in three different concentrations of lemon juice, the lowest concentration was most preferred. A survey confirmed that the local people use lemon in their diet extensively and also discard these with the leftovers. People avoided giving citrus contaminated food to their pets but did not follow the same caution for free-ranging dogs. This study revealed that free-ranging dogs in West Bengal, India, are well adapted to scavenging among citrus-contaminated garbage and have their own strategies to avoid the contamination as far as possible, while maximizing their preferred food intake.</description>
