      <title>Artistic Aspects of the Wigner Caustic and the Centre Symmetry Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner caustic and the Centre Symmetry Set of a closed smooth planar curve are known singular sets which generically admit only cusp singularities. Applications of these objects in semi-classical quantum physics, in chaos theory, in singularity theory, in convex geometry, have been studied since the 1970s until today. These sets can be viewed as envelopes of special families of lines and thanks to that they have many geometric artistic values.</description>

      <title>A note on friends of 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does $20$ have a friend? Or is it a solitary number? A folklore conjecture asserts that $20$ has no friends i.e. it is a solitary number. In this article, we prove that, a friend $N$ of $20$ is of the form $N=2\cdot5^{2a}m^2$ and it has atleast six distinct prime divisors. Also we prove that $N$ must be atleast $2\cdot 10^{12}$. Furthermore, we show that $\Omega(N)\geq 2\omega(N)+6a-5$ and if $\Omega(m)\leq K$ then $N&lt; 10\cdot 6^{(2^{K-2a+3}-1)^2}$, where $\Omega(n)$ and $\omega(n)$ denote the total number of prime divisors and the number of distinct prime divisors of the integer $n$ respectively. In addition, we deduce that, not all exponents of odd prime divisors of friend $N$ of $20$ are congruent to $-1$ modulo $f$, where $f$ is the order of $5$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$ such that $3\mid f$ and $p$ is a prime congruent to $1$ modulo $6$.</description>

      <title>Sandwiching the Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of three analytic functions, two of which are known to have all their zeros on the critical line $\Re (s)=\sigma=1/2$. We construct inequalities which constrain the third function, $\xi(s)$, on $\Im(s)=0$ to lie between the other two functions, in a sandwich structure. We investigate what can be said about the location of zeros and radius of convergence of expansions of $\xi(s)$, with promising results.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci--Theodorus Spiral and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the ancient spiral constructed by the greek philosopher Theodorus which is based on concatenated right triangles, we have created a spiral. In this spiral, called \emph{Fibonacci--Theodorus}, the sides of the triangles have lengths corresponding to Fibonacci numbers. Towards the end of the paper, we present a generalized method applicable to second-order recurrence relations.
  Our exploration of the Fibonacci--Theodorus spiral aims to address a variety of questions, showcasing its unique properties and behaviors. For example, we study topics such as area, perimeter, and angles. Notably, we establish a relationship between the ratio of two consecutive areas and the golden ratio, a pattern that extends to angles sharing a common vertex. Furthermore, we present some asymptotic results. For instance, we demonstrate that the sum of the first $n$ areas comprising the spiral approaches a multiple of the sum of the initial $n$ Fibonacci numbers. Moreover, we provide a sequence of open problems related to all spiral worked in this paper.
  Finally, in his work Hahn, Hahn observed a potential connection between the golden ratio and the ratio of areas between spines of lengths $\sqrt{F_{n+1}}$ and $\sqrt{F_{n+2}-1}$ and the areas between spines of lengths $\sqrt{F_{n}}$ and $\sqrt{F_{n+1}-1}$ in the Theodorus spiral. However, no formal proof has been provided in his work. In this paper, we provide a proof for Hahn's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Generalization of some of Ramanujan's formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We shall make use of the method of partial fractions to generalize some of Ramanujan's infinite series identities, including Ramanujan's famous formula for $\zeta(2n+1)$, and we shall also give a generalization of the transformation formula for the logarithm of the Dedekind eta function. It is shown here that the method of partial fractions can be used to obtain many similar identities of this kind.</description>

      <title>The rectangular spiral or the $n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k$ Points Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of Rip\`a's square spiral solution for the $n \times n \times \cdots \times n$ Points Upper Bound Problem. Additionally, we provide a non-trivial lower bound for the $k$-dimensional $n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k$ Points Problem. In this way, we can build a range in which, with certainty, all the best possible solutions to the problem we are considering will fall. Finally, we give a few characteristic numerical examples in order to appreciate the fineness of the result arising from the particular approach we have chosen.</description>
