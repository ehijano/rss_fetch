      <title>High Resolution ALMA Observations of Richly Structured Protoplanetary Disks in $\sigma$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA has detected substructures in numerous protoplanetary disks at radii from a few to over a hundred au. These substructures are commonly thought to be associated with planet formation, either by serving as sites fostering planetesimal formation or arising as a consequence of planet-disk interactions. Our current understanding of substructures, though, is primarily based on observations of nearby star-forming regions with mild UV environments, whereas stars are typically born in much harsher UV environments, which may inhibit planet formation in the outer disk through external photoevaporation. We present high resolution ($\sim8$ au) ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of eight disks in $\sigma$ Orionis, a cluster irradiated by an O9.5 star. Gaps and rings are resolved in the images of five disks. The most striking of these is SO 1274, which features five gaps that appear to be arranged nearly in a resonant chain. In addition, we infer the presence of gap or shoulder-like structures in the other three disks through visibility modeling. These observations indicate that substructures robustly form and survive at semi-major axes of several tens of au or less in disks exposed to intermediate levels of external UV radiation as well as in compact disks. However, our observations also suggest that disks in $\sigma$ Orionis are mostly small and thus millimeter continuum gaps beyond a disk radius of 50 au are rare in this region, possibly due to either external photoevaporation or age effects.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit lightcurves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameters spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multi-planet transit lightcurves that display transit-timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub.</description>

      <title>The Search for Disk Perturbing Planets Around the Asymmetrical Debris Disk System HD 111520 Using REBOUND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris disks, which are optically thin, dusty disks around main sequence stars, are often found to have structures and/or asymmetries associated with planet-disk interactions. Debris disk morphologies can hence be used as probes for planets in these systems which are unlikely to be detected with other current exoplanet detection methods. In this study we take a look at the very asymmetrical debris disk around HD 111520, which harbours several signs of perturbation such as a ``fork"-like structure in the NW, as well as a 4$^{\circ}$ warp from the midplane on either side of the disk. We simulate the complicated disk morphology using the code REBOUND, with the goal of constraining the possible mass and orbit of the planet responsible for the observed structures. We find that a $\sim$1 M$_{jup}$, eccentric planet that is inclined relative to the disk and has a semi-major axis of $\gtrsim$200 au, is able to reproduce the majority of disk features including the warp, fork and radial extent asymmetry. To create the surface brightness asymmetry, a second eccentric planet is required inside the disk inner edge (50 au), although we are unable to produce the 2 to 1 brightness asymmetry observed, suggesting that a second mechanism may be required. Our work demonstrates how debris disk morphologies alone can be used to learn more about the architecture and evolution of a system as a whole, and can provide planet constraints to determine potential targets for current/future instruments such as JWST/NIRCam and GPI 2.0.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties of the dust grain size in protoplanetary disks retrieved from millimeter continuum observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the dust grain size and its dependence on substructures in protoplanetary disks is a crucial step in understanding the initial process of planet formation. Spectral indices derived from millimeter observations are used as a common probe for grain size. Converting observed spectral indices into grain sizes is a complex task that involves solving the radiative transfer equation, taking into account the disk structure and dust properties. In this work, we ran reference radiative transfer models with known disk properties, and generated four synthetic images at wavelengths of 0.8, 1.3, 3, and 7.8 mm, representing high-resolution continuum observations. Rings and gaps were considered in the setup. We fit the synthetic images using the analytic solution of the radiative transfer equation to investigate the circumstances under which the input grain sizes can be recovered. The results show that fitting images at only two wavelengths is not sufficient to retrieve the grain size. Fitting three images improves the retrieval of grain size, but the dust surface density is still not well recovered. When taking all of the four images into account, degeneracies between different parameters are highly reduced, and consequently the best-fit grain sizes are consistent with the reference setup at almost all radii. We find that the inclination angle has a significant impact on the fitting results. For disks with low inclinations, the analytic approach works quite well. However, when the disk is tilted above about 60 degree, neither the grain size nor the dust surface density can be constrained, as the inclination effect will smooth out all substructures in the radial intensity profile of the disk.</description>

      <title>The Ni isotopic composition of Ryugu reveals a common accretion region for carbonaceous chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotopic compositions of samples returned from Cb-type asteroid Ryugu and Ivuna-type (CI) chondrites are distinct from other carbonaceous chondrites, which has led to the suggestion that Ryugu and CI chondrites formed in a different region of the accretion disk, possibly around the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. We show that, like for Fe, Ryugu and CI chondrites also have indistinguishable Ni isotope anomalies, which differ from those of other carbonaceous chondrites. We propose that this unique Fe and Ni isotopic composition reflects different accretion efficiencies of small FeNi metal grains among the carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. The CI chondrites incorporated these grains more efficiently, possibly because they formed at the end of the disk's lifetime, when planetesimal formation was also triggered by photoevaporation of the disk. Isotopic variations among carbonaceous chondrites may thus reflect fractionation of distinct dust components from a common reservoir, implying CI chondrites and Ryugu may have formed in the same region of the accretion disk as other carbonaceous chondrites.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LX. Molecular line list for the ammonia isotopologue $^{15}$NH$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical line list for $^{15}$NH$_3$ CoYuTe-15 is presented based on the empirical potential energy and ab initio dipole moments surfaces developed and used for the production of the ExoMol line list CoYuTe for $^{14}$NH$_3$. The ro-vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions are computed using the variational program TROVE. The line list ranges up to 10000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda \geq 1$~$\mu$m) and contains 929 795 249 transitions between 1 269 961 states with $J\le 30$. The line list should be applicable for temperatures up to $\sim$1000 K. To improve the accuracy of the line positions, a set of experimentally-derived energy levels of $^{15}$NH$_3$ is produced using the MARVEL procedure. To this end, 37 experimental sources of the line positions of $^{15}$NH$_3$ available in the literature are collected, combined and systematised to produce a self-consistent spectroscopic network of 21095 $^{15}$NH$_3$ transitions covering 40 vibrational bands ranging up to 6818 cm$^{-1}$ and resulting in 2777 energy term values. These MARVEL energies are then used to replace the theoretical values in the CoYuTe-15 line list and also complemented by pseudo-MARVEL energies obtained by an isotopologue extrapolation using the previously reported MARVEL energies of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ parent isotopologue of ammonia. A list of 53856 high resolution transitions between MARVEL states and theoretical intensities is provided in the HITRAN format. Comparison with the recent experimental spectra of $^{15}$NH$_3$ illustrate the potential of the line list for detections and as an efficient assistant in spectroscopic assignments. The line list is available from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Small Bodies in the Distant Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small bodies in the Kuiper Belt region of the distant Solar System are leftovers from planet formation. Their orbital distribution today tells us about how giant planets migrated, while their surface properties, shapes, and sizes tell us about formation processes and collision rates. Probing these intrinsic properties requires a careful understanding of the observational biases that are a part of any telescopic survey that discovers small bodies. While many of the details of giant planet migration are now understood due to careful comparison between de-biased discoveries in the Kuiper Belt and computational simulations, some discoveries have orbits that are still not easy to explain. Upcoming surveys such as the planned survey on Vera Rubin Observatory will help us to leverage the Kuiper Belt and refine our knowledge about the formation and dynamical history of our own Solar System.</description>

      <title>Breaking degeneracies in exoplanetary parameters through self-consistent atmosphere-interior modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: A new generation of instruments (e.g., JWST, ELTs, PLATO, Ariel) is providing atmospheric spectra and mass/radius measurements for large exoplanet populations, challenging planetary models used to interpret these findings. Aims: We develop a new model, the Heat Atmosphere Density Evolution Solver (HADES), by coupling an atmosphere and interior model self-consistently and comparing its results to observed data. Methods: Atmospheric calculations are performed under radiative-convective equilibrium, while the interior relies on recent ab initio equations of state. We ensure continuity in the thermal, gravity, and molecular mass profiles between models. Results: The model is applied to the known exoplanet database to characterize intrinsic thermal properties. We find that intrinsic temperatures (T$_{int}$) of 200-400 K, increasing with equilibrium temperature, are needed to explain radius inflation in hot Jupiters. Additionally, we perform atmosphere-interior retrievals using observed spectra and measured parameters for WASP-39 b and 51 Eridani b. For WASP-39 b, spectroscopic data breaks degeneracies in metallicity and Tint, deriving high values: Z = 14.79$^{+1.80}_{-1.91}$ x Solar and T$_{int} = 297.39^{+8.95}_{-16.9}$ K. For 51 Eridani b, we show the importance of using self-consistent models with radius as a constrained parameter, deriving a planet mass M$_{p} = 3.13^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_{J}$ and a core mass M$_{core} = 31.86^{+0.32}_{-0.18}$ M$_{E}$, suggesting formation via core accretion with a "hot start." Conclusions: Self-consistent atmosphere-interior models can efficiently break degeneracies in the structure of transiting and directly imaged exoplanets, offering new insights into exoplanet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Atmospheres of Solar System Moons and Pluto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres within our Solar System can be categorized into four distinct climate regimes: "terrestrial", "Jovian", "condensable", and "exosphere". Beyond the three terrestrial planets (excluding Mercury) and the four giant planets, collisional atmospheres are also found on smaller celestial bodies such as Jupiter's moon Io, Saturn's moon Titan, Neptune's moon Triton, and Pluto. This article reviews the key characteristics of these atmospheres and the underlying physical and chemical processes that govern them. I focus on their thermal structures, chemical constituents, wind patterns, and the origins and losses of the atmospheres, and highlight the critical roles of surface ices and liquids, atmospheric hazes, and the space environments of their host planets in shaping these atmospheres. I dedicated this article to Prof. Zuo Xiao (1936-2024) at Peking University.</description>

      <title>Close Encounters of the LEO Kind: Spillovers and Resilience in Partially-Automated Traffic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic systems are becoming increasingly automated. How will automated objects interact with non-automated objects? How will partially-automated systems handle large disruptions? Low-Earth orbit (LEO) -- filled with thousands of automated and non-automated satellites and many more uncontrollable pieces of debris -- offers a useful laboratory for these questions. I exploit the COSMOS-1408 (C1408) anti-satellite missile test of November 2021 -- a large and exogenous shock to the orbital environment -- to study how an unexpected disruption affects a partially-automated traffic system. I use publicly-available close approach data, network theory, and an econometric analysis of the C1408 test to study the effect of close encounters with new fragments on the configuration of objects in orbit. I document spillover effects of close encounters with C1408 fragments, heterogeneity in impacts across operators, and changes in system-level resilience to new shocks. These results shed light on the nature of partially-automated traffic systems, and provide a basis for new models to anticipate and mitigate space traffic disruptions.</description>

      <title>Constraining Planetary Albedo of JWST Targets in the TESS bandpass, using TESS, HST and Spitzer Eclipse Depth Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Albedo is one of the important characteristics of hot Jupiter exoplanets. However, albedo constraints have been obtained for very few exoplanets. In this work, we present the TESS Phase Curve observations of WASP-18b, WASP-19b, WASP-121b, WASP-43b, WASP-17b, and WASP-77b, all JWST targets for atmospheric characterization and constrain their occultation depth as well as geometric albedo (A$_g$). We use a grid of self-consistent model atmospheres to constrain the metallicity, C/O ratio, and heat re-distribution for these six targets by fitting to their HST and/or Spitzer observations and also compute the thermal contribution to total occultation depth in the TESS bandpass. We report the first value of TESS occultation depth for WASP-17b ($151_{-66}^{+83}$) and updated value for WASP-77Ab ($94_{-62}^{+53}$). We find self-consistent models constrain high values of thermal contribution to total occultation compared to Planck models. We find very low A$_g$ values for WASP-18b (&lt; 0.089), WASP-19b (&lt; 0.022), WASP-121b ($0.0^{+0.055}_{-0.104}$), WASP-77Ab ($0.017^{+0.126}_{-0.147}$) and significantly higher value for WASP-43b ($0.109^{+0.086}_{-0.088}$) and WASP-17b ($0.401^{+0.526}_{-0.307}$). We find WASP-17b lies in the ideal spot of low gravity and low equilibrium temperature, conducive for cloud formation, leading to high A$_g$. With the best-fit models, we constrain low heat re-distribution for all planets, with WASP-18b having the least. We also constrain sub-solar metallicity for all planets except WASP-17b and WASP-19b. We find a highly sub-solar C/O ratio for WASP-77Ab and WASP-43b, solar for WASP-18b, and super-solar for WASP-121b. The best-fit $P$-$T$ profiles show thermal inversion for WASP-18b and WASP-121b and none for WASP-77b and WASP-43b, which is in agreement with previous works.</description>

      <title>Gen TSO: A General JWST Simulator for Exoplanet Times-series Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gen TSO is a noise calculator specifically tailored to simulate James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) time-series observations of exoplanets. Gen TSO enables the estimation of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for transit or eclipse depths through an interactive graphical interface, similar to the JWST Exposure Time Calculator (ETC). This interface leverages the ETC by combining its noise simulator, Pandeia, with additional exoplanet resources from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, the Gaia DR3 catalog of stellar sources, and the TrExoLiSTS database of JWST programs. The initial release of Gen TSO allows users to calculate S/Ns for all JWST instruments for the spectroscopic time-series modes available as of the Cycle 4 GO call. Additionally, Gen TSO allows users to simulate target acquisition on the science targets or, when needed, on nearby stellar targets within the visit splitting distance. This article presents an overview of Gen TSO and its main functionalities. Gen TSO has been designed to provide both an intuitive graphical interface and a modular API to access the resources mentioned above, facilitating planing and simulation of JWST exoplanet time-series observations. Gen TSO is available for installation via the Python Package Index and its documentation can be found at pcubillos.github.io/gen_tso.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Crossing by Earth of Comet C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS's Ion Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth will pass approximately downstream of the previous position of comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) during 2024 October 10-13. We predict that spacecraft at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1, L1, have a significant likelihood to detect pickup ions from the comet, as well as changes in the solar wind associated with the crossing of the comet's ion tail. Given the Earth's magnetosphere is also likely to cross the ion tail, it is possible that geomagnetic signatures associated with this will be observed by spacecraft within the magnetosphere and possible at ground-based magnetometers, as observed during Comet 1P/Halley's apparition in 1910.</description>

      <title>Polar alignment of a dusty circumbinary disc -- II. Application to 99 Herculis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of dust traffic jams in polar-aligning circumbinary discs. In our first paper, we found as the circumbinary disc evolves towards a polar configuration perpendicular to the binary orbital plane, the differential precession between the gas and dust components leads to multiple dust traffic jams. These dust traffic jams evolve to form a coherent dust ring. In part two, we use 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations of gas and dust to model an initially highly misaligned circumbinary disc around the 99 Herculis (99 Her) binary system. Our results reveal that the formation of these dust rings is observed across various disc parameters, including the disc aspect ratio, viscosity, surface density power law index, and temperature power law index. The dust traffic jams are long-lived and persist even when the disc is fully aligned polar. The midplane dust-to-gas ratio within the rings can surpass unity, which may be a favourable environment for planetesimal formation. Using 2D inviscid shearing box calculations with parameters from our 3D simulations, we find streaming instability modes with significant growth rates. The streaming instability growth timescale is less than the tilt oscillation timescale during the alignment process. Therefore, the dust ring will survive once the gas disc aligns polar, suggesting that the streaming instability may aid in forming polar planets around 99 Her.</description>

      <title>Frequency Comb Calibrated Laser Heterodyne Radiometry for Precision Radial Velocity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disk-integrated observations of the Sun provide a unique vantage point to explore stellar activity and its effect on measured radial velocities. Here, we report a new approach for disk-integrated solar spectroscopy and evaluate its capabilities for solar radial velocity measurements. Our approach is based on a near-infrared laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR) combined with an optical frequency comb calibration, and we show that this combination enables precision, disk-integrated solar spectroscopy with high spectral resolution (~800,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (~2,600), and absolute frequency accuracy. We use the comb-calibrated LHR to record spectra of the solar Fe I 1565 nm transition over a six-week period. We show that our measurements reach sub-meter-per-second radial velocity precision over a single day, and we use daily measurements of the absolute line center to assess the long-term stability of the comb-calibrated LHR approach. We use this long-duration dataset to quantify the principal uncertainty sources that impact the measured radial velocities, and we discuss future modifications that can further improve this approach in studies of stellar variability and its impact on radial velocity measurements.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood LII: M Dwarf Twin Binaries -- Presumed Identical Twins Appear Fraternal in Variability, Rotation, H$\alpha$, and X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the rotation and stellar activity of four fully convective M dwarf `twin' wide binaries. Components in each pair have (1) astrometry confirming they are common-proper-motion binaries, (2) Gaia $BP$, $RP$, and 2MASS $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ magnitudes matching within 0.10 mag, and (3) presumably the same age and composition. We report long-term photometry, rotation periods, multi-epoch H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, X-ray luminosities, time series radial velocities, and speckle observations for all components. Although it might be expected for the twin components to have matching magnetic attributes, this is not the case. Decade-long photometry of GJ 1183 AB indicates consistently higher spot activity on A than B, a trend matched by A appearing 58$\pm$9% stronger in $L_X$ and 26$\pm$9% stronger in H$\alpha$ on average -- this is despite similar rotation periods of A=0.86d and B=0.68d, thereby informing the range in activity for otherwise identical and similarly-rotating M dwarfs. The young $\beta$ Pic Moving Group member 2MA 0201+0117 AB displays a consistently more active B component that is 3.6$\pm$0.5 times stronger in $L_X$ and 52$\pm$19% stronger in H$\alpha$ on average, with distinct rotation at A=6.01d and B=3.30d. Finally, NLTT 44989 AB displays remarkable differences with implications for spindown evolution -- B has sustained H$\alpha$ emission while A shows absorption, and B is $\geq$39$\pm$4 times stronger in $L_X$, presumably stemming from the surprisingly different rotation periods of A=38d and B=6.55d. The last system, KX Com, has an unresolved radial velocity companion, and is therefore not a twin system.</description>

      <title>Linear instability in thermally-stratified quasi-Keplerian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-Keplerian flow, a special regime of Taylor-Couette co-rotating flow, is of great astrophysical interest for studying angular momentum transport in accretion disks. The well-known magnetorotational instability (MRI) successfully explains the flow instability and generation of turbulence in certain accretion disks, but fails to account for these phenomena in protoplanetary disks where magnetic effects are negligible. Given the intrinsic decrease of the temperature in these disks, we examine the effect of radial thermal stratification on 3-D global disturbances in linearised quasi-Keplerian flows under radial gravitational acceleration mimicking stellar gravity. Our results show a thermohydrodynamic linear instability for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes across a broad parameter space of the thermally-stratified quasi-Keplerian flow. Generally, decreasing Richardson or Prandtl numbers stabilises the flow, while a reduced radius ratio destabilises it. This work also provides a quantitative characterisation of the instability. At low Prandtl numbers $Pr$, we observe a scaling relation of the linear critical Taylor number $Ta_c\propto$$Pr^{-6/5}$. Extrapolating the observed scaling to high $Ta$ and low $Pr$ may suggest the relevance of the instability to accretion disks. Moreover, even slight thermal stratification, characterised by a low Richardson number, can trigger the flow instability with a small axial wavelength. These findings are qualitatively consistent with the results from a traditional local stability analysis based on short wave approximations. Our study refines the thermally-induced linearly-unstable transition route in protoplanetary disks to explain angular momentum transport in dead zones where MRI is ineffective.</description>

Abstract: Planet-star obliquity and planet-planet ]mutual inclination encode a planetary system's dynamical history, but both of their values are hard to measure for misaligned systems with close-in companions. HAT-P-11 is a K4 star with two known planets: a close-in, misaligned super-Neptune with a $\approx$5-day orbit, and an outer super-Jupiter with a $\approx$10-year orbit. In this work we present a joint orbit fit of the HAT-P-11 system with astrometry and S-index corrected RV data. By combining our results with previous constraints on the orientation of the star and the inner planet, we find that all three angular momenta -- those of the star, planet b, and planet c -- are significantly misaligned. We confirm the status of planet c as a super-Jupiter, with $2.68\pm0.41\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$ at a semimajor axis of $4.10\pm0.06\,$AU, and planet b's mass of $\mathrm{M_b\sin{i_b}}=0.074\pm0.004\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$. We present the posterior probability distribution of obliquity between star A and planet c, and mutual inclination between planet b and planet c.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Binary Planets within Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. Critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. The critical flyby criterion we derived offers an improvement over the commonly used tidal radius criterion, particularly in high-speed stellar encounters. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 \sim$ 10-20 au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$ Myr pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.</description>

      <title>Impacting Atmospheres: How Late-Stage Pollution Alters Exoplanet Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric composition of exoplanets is often considered as a probe of the planet's formation condition. How exactly the initial chemical memory may be altered from the birth to the final state of the planet, however, remains unknown. Here, we develop a simple model of pollution of planetary atmosphere by the vaporization of infalling planetesimal of varying sizes and composition (SiO$_2$ inside 1 au and H$_2$O outside 1 au), following their trajectory and thermal evolution through the upper advective and radiative layers of a sub-Neptune class planet during the late stage of disk evolution. We vary the rate of pollution by changing the solid content of the disk and by dialing the level of disk gas depletion which in turn determines the rate of planetary migration. We find that pollution by silicate grains will always be limited by the saturation limit set by the thermal state of the atmosphere. By contrast, pollution by water ice can lead to $\sim$2--4 orders of magnitude variation in the atmospheric water mass fraction depending on the solid and gas content of the disk. Both cases suggest that post-formation pollution can erase the initial compositional memory of formation. Post-formation pollution can potentially transform sub-Neptunes with H/He-dominated envelope that initially formed beyond the iceline to waterworlds (water-enriched envelope) when the disk gas is depleted by $\gtrsim$2 orders of magnitude, allowing gentle migration. We additionally discuss the expected C/O ratio profile under pollution by water and refractory carbon species.</description>

      <title>Water in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI: spectral excitation atlas, diagnostic diagrams for temperature and column density, and detection of disk-rotation line broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims at providing fundamental general tools for the analysis of water spectra as observed in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI. We analyze 25 high-quality spectra from the JDISC Survey reduced with asteroid calibrators as presented in Pontoppidan et al. 2024. First, we present a spectral atlas to illustrate the clustering of water transitions from different upper level energies ($E_u$) and identify single (un-blended) lines that provide the most reliable measurements. With the atlas, we demonstrate two important excitation effects: one related to the opacity saturation of ortho-para line pairs that overlap, and the other to the sub-thermal excitation of $v=1-1$ lines scattered across the $v=0-0$ rotational band. Second, from this larger line selection we define a list of fundamental lines spanning $E_u$ from 1500 to 6000 K to develop simple line-ratio diagrams as diagnostics of temperature components and column density. Third, we report the detection of disk-rotation Doppler broadening of molecular lines, which demonstrates the radial distribution of water emission at different $E_u$ and confirms from gas kinematics a radially-extended $\approx 170$--220 K reservoir, close to the ice sublimation front. We also report the detection of narrow blue-shifted absorption from an inner disk wind in ro-vibrational H2O and CO lines, which may be observed in disks at inclinations $&gt; 50$ deg. We summarize these findings and tools into a general recipe that should be beneficial to community efforts to study water in planet-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Spatially correlated stellar accretion in the Lupus star forming region: Evidence for ongoing infall from the interstellar medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material are potential ways to further test this finding.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \times 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Spectral Model of Main Sequence Stars in Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer. Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff , 0.09 dex in log g, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [{\alpha}/Fe] and 1.9 km/s in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR&gt;50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at {\geq}20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars (SPOCS) survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.</description>

Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>
