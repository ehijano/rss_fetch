      <title>Synergistic Bioactivity of Neem and Tulsi Infusions Treated with Plasma-Activated Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of plasma activated water (PAW) with herbal infusions offers a sustainable approach to enhancing the functional bioactivity of plant derived compounds. In this study, neem (Azadirachta indica) and tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) infusions were treated with PAW generated using an atmospheric pressure gliding arc discharge system. The aim was to investigate plasma induced modifications in phytochemicals and their subsequent effects on antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Spectroscopic (UV Vis, FTIR) and chromatographic (HPLC) analyses demonstrated structural alterations in key polyphenolic constituents, accompanied by mild acidification and changes in redox potential. Total phenolic content (TPC) and flavonoid levels increased significantly following 10 min PAW treatment, while prolonged exposure (15 min) led to partial degradation, suggesting an optimum treatment window. Antioxidant assays (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP) confirmed improved radical scavenging capacity, correlating with enhanced reducing power of modified phytochemicals. Antimicrobial evaluation against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus revealed synergistic inhibitory effects, with reduced minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for PAW-treated infusions. Collectively, the results highlight the potential of PAW to modulate herbal bioactives, extending their efficacy in natural preservation systems and biomedical formulations. This green plasma-herbal synergy provides a promising pathway toward eco-friendly food safety and healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding microfabricated nanocalorimeter performance and responses to the energy fluxes from low-temperature plasma discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma diagnostics have a shortage of fast and sensitive calorimetric sensors that can track substrate temperature during plasma-assisted microfabrication. In this work, energy fluxes from argon and oxygen radiofrequency (RF) glow discharges have been probed using a novel nanocalorimeter sensor. The probe consists of an ultrathin SiNx membrane (100 nm) with a lithographically defined Pt micro-strip (100 nm) that serves as a calibrated resistance thermometer. The sensor temperature can increase from room temperature to several hundred degrees within a second upon exposure to RF plasma, depending on the experiment's geometry and plasma parameters. Such sensitivity and response time are due to the pre-designed reduced heat capacity of the sensor and significantly reduced thermal conductance of the cooling channels. These features enable the sensitive detection of low-energy plasma fluxes on surfaces and their rapid discrimination, as in the case of ion and electron fluxes, by biasing the sensor at negative or positive potentials. These biased nanocalorimeter energy readings have been compared with ion and electron kinetic energy dissipations assessed using a Langmuir probe and retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA). Finally, the robustness of the plasma nanocalorimeter is discussed in terms of its baseline drifts, degradation, and longevity.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>

      <title>The effect of surface quenching coefficients of $O_2(a^{1}{\Delta}g)$ and $O_2(b^{1}{\Sigma}g^{+})$ on capacitively coupled $Ar$/$O_2$ discharge: A global/equivalent circuit model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacitively coupled discharges operated in mixtures of $Ar$ and $O_2$ are extensively utilized in plasma etching and deposition processes due to the oxidative properties and precursor functionality of the reactive species produced in the discharge. In $Ar$/$O_2$ discharges, the surface quenching coefficient of $O_2(a^{1}{\Delta}g)$ is known to affect this metastable density, which, in turn, affects the electronegativity and other important plasma characteristics. In this work, in addition to $O_2(a^{1}{\Delta}g)$, $O_2(b^{1}{\Sigma}g^{+})$ and its associated reactions are incorporated into a global/equivalent circuit model of an $Ar$/$O_2$ discharge. By independently adjusting the quenching coefficients of both metastable species, changes of these surface coefficients are found to significantly affect the discharge characteristics, indicating that the role of $O_2(b^{1}{\Sigma}g^{+})$ cannot be neglected. The effects of their respective surface quenching coefficients of these metastables based on various wall materials on the discharge are revealed including their effects on different particle species densities, plasma impedance, voltage drops across the sheaths, as well as plasma power absorption.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Medium Modulation of Nonlinear Kinetic Alfv\'en Morphology in Structured Galactic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially dependent framework for the existence and propagation of nonlinear kinetic Alfv\'en (KA) structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $\beta$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$\beta$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$\beta$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell" morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties. This study establishes a direct link between macroscopic ISM morphology, ion-kinetic scale dissipation, and the emergence of coherent Alfv\'enic activity, with implications for radio scattering, pulsar scintillation, and fine-scale signatures in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Space Signatures of Energy Transfer for Ion-Acoustic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) of electrostatic waves suggest that electrostatic instabilities, including the ion-ion-acoustic instability (IIAI) frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, play an important role in plasma heating and particle acceleration. Aims. Our aim is to explore the application of single spacecraft diagnostics to the IIAI, in anticipation of application to the current missions operating in the inner heliosphere, e.g. PSP and Solar Orbiter. Methods. We apply the field-particle correlation (FPC) technique to fully kinetic simulations of IIAI. We characterize the conversion of energy between the electric field and particle species, allowing the differentiation between oscillatory and secular energy transfer to and from the particles and highlighting the role of resonant energy exchange. We then identify the characteristic IIAI signatures for the proton and electron distributions, and relate them to our previous knowledge of IIAI onset and energy exchange mechanisms. Results. Applying the FPC technique to our simulations run in parameters regime compatible with solar wind conditions, we have identified IIAI signatures that would enable efficient recognition of IIAI in observations. This task is left for future missions, since the time scale over which IIAI signatures develop is too fast for the sampling rates of current missions.</description>

      <title>Electric field-driven Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability in binary complex plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations to explore Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma, when heavier dust particles are positioned above the lighter ones, having the same charge-to-mass ratio, in a planar configuration. Langevin dynamics simulations are used to study the evolution of perturbations at the interface between these two distinct species of charged dust particles, subject to an externally applied electric field and an equilibrium charge density gradient. We have performed analytical calculations to determine the growth rate of instability under both strongly coupled and weakly coupled dusty plasma regimes. These theoretical predictions are subsequently validated through molecular dynamics simulations, enabling the reproduction of the instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma. The instability in these cases ultimately causes mixing among the charged species. The study comprehensively analyzes the growth rate as a function of various system parameters, and it offers deeper insight into the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Near-axis quasi-isodynamic database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the landscape of quasi-isodynamic stellarators using the near-axis expansion of the magnetic field. Building on recent theoretical developments, we construct a database of more than 800,000 stable, approximately quasi-isodynamic vacuum magnetic configurations. These configurations span a range of field period numbers and other geometric control parameters, including the magnetic axis shape and plasma elongation. To evaluate each configuration, we use a broad set of measures, including effective ripple, sensitivity of the Shafranov shift to changes in plasma beta, the prevalence of maximum-J trapped particles, and the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual, among others. This enables an exhaustive, thorough and quantitative characterization of the database. Statistical analysis and modern machine learning techniques are then employed to find correlations, and identify key descriptors and heuristics to help understand tendencies that govern the behaviour of numerical optimization. The database provides baseline configurations for further studies, and to serve as tailored initial conditions for optimization. With this work we initiate a long term program to complete a systematic exploration of quasi-isodynamic stellarator design space.</description>

      <title>Plasma-Activated Zn, Fe, Mn Micronutrient Solutions for Crop Biofortification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micronutrient deficiency in soils limits crop productivity and reduces the nutritional quality of cereals and pulses. Conventional fertilizer supplementation often suffers from low bioavailability and environmental losses. In this study, we investigate the use of Plasma Activated Water (PAW) enriched with divalent micronutrient ions as a sustainable alternative to enhance nutrient uptake, soil fertility, and seed vigor. The PAW was generated using a gliding arc plasma system in air, and ion-enriched solutions were prepared at controlled concentrations. The physicochemical parameters (pH, ORP, conductivity, RONS species) were analyzed to assess the plasma induced reactivity. Treatments were applied to micronutrient deficient soils for wheat (Triticum aestivum) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) seeds under greenhouse conditions. Results demonstrated significant enhancement in germination index, chlorophyll content, and shoot root biomass compared to controls. PAW and ionic treatments notably increased the micronutrient content in grains, indicating effective biofortification. Soil microbial activity and enzyme assays showed no toxicity and a mild stimulatory effect due to reactive nitrogen species. This study establishes a green, scalable method of delivering micronutrients through plasma-activated irrigation water, linking plasma chemistry with sustainable agronomy and nutritional security.</description>

      <title>Conservative velocity mappings for discontinuous Galerkin kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum computational kinetic plasma models evolve the distribution function of a plasma species $f_s$ on a phase-space grid over time. In many problems of interest the distribution function has limited extent in velocity space; hence, using a uniform, highly refined mesh would be costly and slow. Nonuniform velocity grids can reduce the computational cost by placing more degrees of freedom where $f_s$ is appreciable and fewer where it is not. In this work we introduce a first-of-its kind discontinuous Galerkin approach to nonuniform velocity-space discretization using mapped velocity coordinates. This new method is presented in the context of a gyrokinetic model used to study magnetized plasmas. We create discretizations of collisionless and collisional terms using mappings in a way that exactly conserves particles and energy. Numerical tests of such properties are presented, and we show that this new discretization can reproduce earlier gyrokinetic simulations using grids with up to 6-60 times fewer cells and 22X-60X speed-ups depending on dimensionality, geometry and plasma parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropy of kinetic coefficients in presence of a magnetic field is
  represented by Hall currents, which appear in a collisional medium due to action of the Lorentz force on the charged particles between collisions.
  We derive equations, describing dynamics of the magnetic field in presence of thermo-diffusion with Hall currents, using a standard electrodynamic consideration. The influence of the Hall currents, at presence of thermo-diffusion, on the magnetic field structure is considered in simple models. The equation is derived, which includes additional term for a seed magnetic field creation in the non-magnetized plasma, due to thermo-diffusion. This equation describes the action of the seed magnetic field creation by the mechanism known as "Biermann battery".</description>

      <title>Electron neural closure for turbulent magnetosheath simulations: energy channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a non-local five-moment electron pressure tensor closure parametrized by a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN). Electron pressure plays an important role in generalized Ohm's law, competing with electron inertia. This model is used in the development of a surrogate model for a fully kinetic energy-conserving semi-implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation of decaying magnetosheath turbulence. We achieve this by training FCNN on a representative set of simulations with a smaller number of particles per cell and showing that our results generalise to a simulation with a large number of particles per cell. We evaluate the statistical properties of the learned equation of state, with a focus on pressure-strain interaction, which is crucial for understanding energy channels in turbulent plasmas. The resulting equation of state learned via FCNN significantly outperforms local closures, such as those learned by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or double adiabatic expressions. We report that the overall spatial distribution of pressure-strain and its conditional averages are reconstructed well. However, some small-scale features are missed, especially for the off-diagonal components of the pressure tensor. Nevertheless, the results are substantially improved with more training data, indicating favorable scaling and potential for improvement, which will be addressed in future work.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cathode Boundary and Initial Electron Swarm Width on Electron Swarm Parameter Determination with the Pulsed Townsend Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pulsed Townsend experiment enables the extraction of relevant electron transport properties in different gases such as the electron drift velocity $W$ (or equivalently the mobility $\mu$), the longitudinal diffusion coefficient $D_{\mathrm{L}}$, and the effective ionization rate $R_{\mathrm{net}}$ (or equivalently the effective ionization coefficient $\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Existing analysis techniques lack an accurate representation of the experimental initial and boundary conditions. This work aims to provide an improved evaluation approach by appropriately considering both initial and boundary conditions in order to extract more accurate swarm parameters from measurement data. Simulative and experimental measurement results verify an increased evaluation accuracy. Furthermore, the longitudinal diffusion coefficient $D_{\mathrm{L}}$ can now be accurately extracted from Pulsed Townsend measurements. The developed curve fitting code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Role of Shafranov shift, zonal structures on the behavior of TAEs, AAEs and microinstabilities in the presence of energetic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In future nuclear fusion reactors, even a small fraction of fusion-born energetic particles (EP) about 100 times hotter than the thermal bulk species, contributes substantially to the kinetic pressure and therefore affect the MHD equilibrium, mainly via the Shafranov shift. In this work, we perform first-principles numerical simulations using the gyrokinetic, electromagnetic, global code ORB5 to study the effect of a self-consistent finite $\beta$ equilibrium on the arising Alfv\'en Eigenmodes (destabilized by EPs), Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG), and Kinetic Ballooning Modes (KBM) microturbulence (destabilized by thermal species). Linearly, we explore the complex interplay between EP fraction, bulk gradients and a self-consistent Shafranov shift on the plasma stability. We choose single toroidal mode numbers to represent the system's instabilities and study the characteristic nonlinear evolutions of TAEs, KBMs and ITGs separately and including the axisymmetric field response to each mode separately. This study focuses on the impact of Shafranov shift equilibrium consistency, as well as the self-generated zonal ${E \times B}$ flows, the saturation levels and resulting heat and particle fluxes. In the ITG cases including the $n=0$ perturbations reduces turbulent fluxes, as expected, however, for the TAE cases including the $n=0$ perturbations is shown to enhance the fluxes. We show for the first time that Axisymmetric Alfv\'en Eigenmodes (AAEs) play a role in this mechanism.</description>
