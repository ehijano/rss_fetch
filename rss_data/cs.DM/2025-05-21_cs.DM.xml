      <title>ResQue Greedy: Rewiring Sequential Greedy for Improved Submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Rewired Sequential Greedy (ResQue Greedy), an enhanced approach for submodular maximization under cardinality constraints. By integrating a novel set curvature metric within a lattice-based framework, ResQue Greedy identifies and corrects suboptimal decisions made by the standard sequential greedy algorithm. Specifically, a curvature-aware rewiring strategy is employed to dynamically redirect the solution path, leading to improved approximation performance over the conventional sequential greedy algorithm without significantly increasing computational complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ResQue Greedy achieves tighter near-optimality bounds compared to the traditional sequential greedy method.</description>

      <title>On near optimal colorable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\cal G$ is said to be \emph{near optimal colorable} if there exists a constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \cal G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \max\{c, \omega(G)\}$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. The class of near optimal colorable graphs is an important subclass of the class of $\chi$-bounded graphs which is well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we show that the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is near optimal colorable, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$. This partially answers a question of Ju and Huang [Theoretical Computer Science 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] and a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished). Furthermore, using these results with some earlier known results, we also provide an alternate proof to the fact that the \textsc{Chromatic Number} problem for the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is solvable in polynomial time, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$.</description>

      <title>On the size of the neighborhoods of a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The d-neighborhood of a word W in the Levenshtein distance is the set of all words at distance at most d from W. Generating the neighborhood of a word W, or related sets of words such as the condensed neighborhood or the super-condensed neighborhood has applications in the design of approximate pattern matching algorithms. It follows that bounds on the maximum size of the neighborhood of words of a given length can be used in the complexity analysis of such approximate pattern matching algorithms. In this note, we present exact formulas for the size of the condensed and super condensed neighborhoods of a unary word, a novel upper bound for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length, and we prove a conjectured upper bound again for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length.</description>

      <title>Graphon Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub and dense structures. Based on recent results about graphons on line graphs, our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs. We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs, as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>A composition theory for upward planar orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An upward planar order on an acyclic directed graph $G$ is a special linear extension of the edge poset of $G$ that satisfies the nesting condition. This order was introduced to combinatorially characterize upward plane graphs and progressive plane graphs (commonly known as plane string diagrams). In this paper, motivated by the theory of graphical calculus for monoidal categories, we establish a composition theory for upward planar orders. The main result is that the composition of upward planar orders is an upward planar order. This theory provides a practical method to calculate the upward planar order of a progressive plane graph or an upward plane graph.</description>

      <title>Path Contraction Faster than $2^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is contractible to a graph $H$ if there is a set $X \subseteq E(G)$, such that $G/X$ is isomorphic to $H$. Here, $G/X$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all the edges in $X$. For a family of graphs $\cal F$, the $\mathcal{F}$-\textsc{Contraction} problem takes as input a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, and the objective is to output the largest integer $t$, such that $G$ is contractible to a graph $H \in {\cal F}$, where $|V(H)|=t$. When $\cal F$ is the family of paths, then the corresponding $\mathcal{F}$-\textsc{Contraction} problem is called \textsc{Path Contraction}. The problem \textsc{Path Contraction} admits a simple algorithm running in time $2^{n}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. In spite of the deceptive simplicity of the problem, beating the $2^{n}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ bound for \textsc{Path Contraction} seems quite challenging. In this paper, we design an exact exponential time algorithm for \textsc{Path Contraction} that runs in time $1.99987^n\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. We also define a problem called \textsc{$3$-Disjoint Connected Subgraphs}, and design an algorithm for it that runs in time $1.88^n\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The above algorithm is used as a sub-routine in our algorithm for {\sc Path Contraction}</description>

      <title>An asymptotic rigidity property from the realizability of chirotope extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a finite full-dimensional point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that if a point configuration $Q$ has the property that all finite chirotopes realizable by adding (generic) points to $P$ are also realizable by adding points to $Q$, then $P$ and $Q$ are equal up to a direct affine transform. We also show that for any point configuration $P$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a finite, (generic) extension $\widehat P$ of $P$ with the following property: if another realization $Q$ of the chirotope of $P$ can be extended so as to realize the chirotope of $\widehat P$, then there exists a direct affine transform that maps each point of $Q$ within distance $\varepsilon$ of the corresponding point of $P$.</description>

      <title>Better Neural Network Expressivity: Subdividing the Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Firefighting on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a pursuit-evasion game that describes the process of extinguishing a fire burning on the nodes of an undirected graph. We denote the minimum number of firefighters required by $\text{ffn}(G)$ and provide a characterization for the graphs with $\text{ffn}(G)=1$ and $\text{ffn}(G)=2$ as well as almost sharp bounds for complete binary trees. We show that deciding whether $\text{ffn}(G) \leq m$ for given $G$ and $m$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that shortest strategies can have superpolynomial length, leaving open whether the problem is in NP. Based on some plausible conjectures, we also prove that this decision problem is neither NP-hard for graphs with bounded treewidth nor for constant $m$.</description>
