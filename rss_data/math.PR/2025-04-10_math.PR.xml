      <title>A Tail-Respecting Explicit Numerical Scheme for L\'evy-Driven SDEs With Superlinear Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit numerical approximation scheme, denoted by $\{X^n\}$, for the effective simulation of solutions $X$ to a multivariate stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a superlinearly growing $\kappa$-dissipative drift, where $\kappa&gt;1$, driven by a multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy process that has a finite $p$-th moment, with $p&gt;0$. We show that for any $q\in (0,p+\kappa-1)$, the strong $L^q$-convergence $\sup_{t\in[0,T]}\mathbf{E} \|X^n_t-X_t\|^q=\mathcal{O} (h_n^{\gamma})$ holds true, in particular, our numerical scheme preserves the $q$-moments of the solution beyond the order $p$. Additionally, for any $q\in (0,p)$ we establish strong uniform convergence: $\mathbf{E}\sup_{t\in[0,T]} \|X^n_t-X_t\|^q=\mathcal{O} ( h_n^{\delta_q^\mathrm{uc}} )$. In both cases we determine the convergence rates $\gamma$ and $\delta_q^\mathrm{uc}$.
  In the special case of SDEs driven solely by a Brownian motion, our numerical scheme preserves super-exponential moments of the solution.
  The scheme $\{X^n\}$ is realized as a combination of a well-known Euler method with a Lie--Trotter type splitting technique.</description>

      <title>Non triviality of the percolation threshold and Gumbel fluctuations for Branching Interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the model of Branching Interlacements, introduced by Zhu, which is a natural analogue of Sznitman's Random Interlacements model, where the random walk trajectories are replaced by ranges of some suitable tree-indexed random walks. We first prove a basic decorrelation inequality for events depending on the state of the field on distinct boxes. We then show that in all relevant dimensions, the vacant set undergoes a nontrivial phase transition regarding the existence of an infinite connected component. Finally we obtain the Gumbel fluctuations for the cover level of finite sets, which is analogous to Belius' result in the setting of Random Interlacements.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for general convolution approximations to a large class of log-correlated Gaussian fields, the properly normalised supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures converge stably to a nontrivial limit. This limit depends on the choice of regularisation only through a multiplicative constant and can be characterised as an integrated atomic measure with a random intensity expressed in terms of the critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <title>Point processes of the Poisson-Skellam family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general non-homogeneous Skellam-type process with jumps of arbitrary fixed size. We express this process in terms of a linear combination of Poisson processes and study several properties, including the summation of independent processes of the same family, some possible decompositions (which present particularly interesting characteristics) and the limit behaviors. In the case of homogeneous rate functions, a compound Poisson representation and a discrete approximation are presented. Then, we study the fractional integral of the process as well as the iterated integral of the running average. Finally, we consider some time-changed versions related to L\'{e}vy subordinators, connected to the Bernstein functions, and to the inverses of stable subordinators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish some strong laws of large numbers (SLLN) for non-independent variables under the framework of sublinear expectations. One of our main results is for blockwise m-dependent random variables and another is for orthogonal random variables, both of which are the generalization of SLLN for independent random variables in sublinear expectation spaces.</description>

      <title>Throughput-Optimal Scheduling Algorithms for LLM Inference and AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents rapidly grows, optimizing systems for efficient LLM inference becomes critical. While significant efforts have targeted system-level engineering, little is explored through a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective.
  In this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for LLM inference, bridging the gap between queuing and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for both individual requests and AI agent workloads, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FastTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution.
  Our results highlight the substantial benefits queuing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary developments.</description>

      <title>The Scaling Behaviors in Achieving High Reliability via Chance-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of resource provisioning under stringent reliability or service level requirements, which arise in applications such as power distribution, emergency response, cloud server provisioning, and regulatory risk management. With chance-constrained optimization serving as a natural starting point for modeling this class of problems, our primary contribution is to characterize how the optimal costs and decisions scale for a generic joint chance-constrained model as the target probability of satisfying the service/reliability constraints approaches its maximal level. Beyond providing insights into the behavior of optimal solutions, our scaling framework has three key algorithmic implications. First, in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) modeling of chance constraints, we show that widely used approaches based on KL-divergences, Wasserstein distances, and moments heavily distort the scaling properties of optimal decisions, leading to exponentially higher costs. In contrast, incorporating marginal distributions or using appropriately chosen f-divergence balls preserves the correct scaling, ensuring decisions remain conservative by at most a constant or logarithmic factor. Second, we leverage the scaling framework to quantify the conservativeness of common inner approximations and propose a simple line search to refine their solutions, yielding near-optimal decisions. Finally, given N data samples, we demonstrate how the scaling framework enables the estimation of approximately Pareto-optimal decisions with constraint violation probabilities significantly smaller than the Omega(1/N)-barrier that arises in the absence of parametric assumptions</description>

      <title>Performance of Rank-One Tensor Approximation on Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the estimation of a rank-one tensor signal when only a portion $\varepsilon$ of its noisy observation is available. We show that the study of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose spectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results shed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial reduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of its entries.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Distance Kernels for MMDs and Applications in Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative distance kernels $K(x,y) := - \|x-y\|$ were used in the definition of maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) in statistics and lead to favorable numerical results in various applications. In particular, so-called slicing techniques for handling high-dimensional kernel summations profit from the simple parameter-free structure of the distance kernel. However, due to its non-smoothness in $x=y$, most of the classical theoretical results, e.g. on Wasserstein gradient flows of the corresponding MMD functional do not longer hold true. In this paper, we propose a new kernel which keeps the favorable properties of the negative distance kernel as being conditionally positive definite of order one with a nearly linear increase towards infinity and a simple slicing structure, but is Lipschitz differentiable now. Our construction is based on a simple 1D smoothing procedure of the absolute value function followed by a Riemann-Liouville fractional integral transform. Numerical results demonstrate that the new kernel performs similarly well as the negative distance kernel in gradient descent methods, but now with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Shuffling via Transpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of card shuffles of $n$ cards, where the allowed moves involve transpositions corresponding to the Jucys--Murphy elements of $\{S_m\}_{m \leq n}$. We diagonalize the transition matrix of these shuffles. As a special case, we consider the $k$-star transpositions shuffle, a natural interpolation between random transpositions and star transpositions. We proved that the $k$-star transpositions shuffle exhibits total variation cutoff at time $\frac{2n-(k+1)}{2(n-1)}n\log n$ with a window of $\frac{2n-(k+1)}{2(n-1)}n$. Furthermore, we prove that for the case where $k/n \rightarrow 0$ or $1$, this shuffle has the same limit profile as random transpositions, which has been fully determined by Teyssier.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\beta^2 &gt; 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing a physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and establishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative Gaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\beta^2 = 2\pi$. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for a cone multiplier. Moreover, the probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\beta^2 = 6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite surprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold at $\beta^2 =8\pi$.</description>

      <title>Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10531v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Busemann process and competition interfaces of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d.\ weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, in both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We prove new regularity properties of the Busemann process without reliance on unproved assumptions on the shape function. For example, each nearest-neighbor Busemann function is strictly monotone and has the same random set of discontinuities in the direction variable. When all Busemann functions on a horizontal line are viewed together, the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution that obeys a version of the geometric Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. When specialized to the inverse-gamma case, this relationship enables an explicit distributional description: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities which -- unlike in zero-temperature last-passage percolation -- are dense. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force -- one solution principle of the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

Abstract: We examine the sensitivity at the origin of the distributional robust optimization problem in the context of a model generated by a mean field stochastic differential equation. We adapt the finite dimensional argument developed by Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \&amp; Wiesel to our framework involving the infinite dimensional gradient of the solution of the mean field SDE with respect to its initial data. We revisit the derivation of this gradient process as previously introduced by Buckdahn, Li \&amp; Peng, and we complement the existing properties so as to satisfy the requirement of our main result.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicit representations for the (Siegmund-) dual and the time-reversed flow of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes whenever these exist. It turns out that the dual and the process corresponding to the reversed stochastic flow are again generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Further, we observe that the stationary distribution of the dual process provides information about the hitting time of zero of the original process.</description>

      <title>A case study of the long-time behavior of the Gaussian local-field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any integer $\kappa \geq 2$, the $\kappa$-local-field equation ($\kappa$-LFE) characterizes the limit of the neighborhood path empirical measure of interacting diffusions on $\kappa$-regular random graphs, as the graph size goes to infinity. It has been conjectured that the long-time behavior of the (in general non-Markovian) $\kappa$-LFE coincides with that of a certain more tractable Markovian analog, the Markov $\kappa$-local-field equation. In the present article, we prove this conjecture for the case when $\kappa = 2$ and the diffusions are one-dimensional with affine drifts. As a by-product of our proof, we also show that for interacting diffusions on the $n$-cycle (or 2-regular random graph on $n$ vertices), the limits $n \rightarrow \infty$ and $t\rightarrow \infty$ commute. Along the way, we also establish well-posedness of the Markov $\kappa$-local field equations with affine drifts for all $\kappa \geq 2$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the macroscopic market making framework as a control problem, this paper investigates its extension to stochastic games. In the context of price competition, each agent is benchmarked against the best quote offered by the others. We begin with the linear case. While constructing the solution directly, the \textit{ordering property} and the dimension reduction in the equilibrium are revealed. For the non-linear case, we extend the decoupling approach by introducing a multidimensional \textit{characteristic equation} to analyse the well-posedness of the forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Properties of the coefficients in this characteristic equation are derived using tools from non-smooth analysis. Several new well-posedness results are presented.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback--Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and prove an explicit representation of the Radon--Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, resulting in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints. We propose two deep learning algorithms to approximate the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with an extended application to combine implied volatility smile models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor log-concave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these quasiparticles; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the quasiparticle data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the quasiparticle locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>Effective Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these quasiparticles, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of quasiparticles locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Robustness quantification: a new method for assessing the reliability of the predictions of a classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on existing ideas in the field of imprecise probabilities, we present a new approach for assessing the reliability of the individual predictions of a generative probabilistic classifier. We call this approach robustness quantification, compare it to uncertainty quantification, and demonstrate that it continues to work well even for classifiers that are learned from small training sets that are sampled from a shifted distribution.</description>
