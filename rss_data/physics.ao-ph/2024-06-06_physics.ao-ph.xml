      <title>Spatiotemporal Predictions of Toxic Urban Plumes Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial accidents, chemical spills, and structural fires can release large amounts of harmful materials that disperse into urban atmospheres and impact populated areas. Computer models are typically used to predict the transport of toxic plumes by solving fluid dynamical equations. However, these models can be computationally expensive due to the need for many grid cells to simulate turbulent flow and resolve individual buildings and streets. In emergency response situations, alternative methods are needed that can run quickly and adequately capture important spatiotemporal features. Here, we present a novel deep learning model called ST-GasNet that was inspired by the mathematical equations that govern the behavior of plumes as they disperse through the atmosphere. ST-GasNet learns the spatiotemporal dependencies from a limited set of temporal sequences of ground-level toxic urban plumes generated by a high-resolution large eddy simulation model. On independent sequences, ST-GasNet accurately predicts the late-time spatiotemporal evolution, given the early-time behavior as an input, even for cases when a building splits a large plume into smaller plumes. By incorporating large-scale wind boundary condition information, ST-GasNet achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 90% on test data for the entire prediction period.</description>

      <title>High-order Shallow Water Equations (HSWE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most coastal flows are turbulent and cannot be accurately described by shallow water equations. This paper presents a novel theory for characterizing accelerated coastal flows, offering improved representation of turbulent flows. The theory builds on second-order approximation long-wave theory, utilizing a dual-velocity vector approach (comprising a mean velocity and a turbulence-induced distortion velocity) in the primary flow directions. The resulting second-order long-wave model consists of five equations, which is one fewer than the number derived from averaged models that incorporate turbulence as reported in the literature, yet it retains equivalent physical and hydrodynamic characteristics. The eigenstructure of the model is presented. This modeling approach shows promise for addressing a variety of engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Predicting unobserved climate time series data at distant areas via spatial correlation using reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collecting time series data spatially distributed in many locations is often important for analyzing climate change and its impacts on ecosystems. However, comprehensive spatial data collection is not always feasible, requiring us to predict climate variables at some locations. This study focuses on a prediction of climatic elements, specifically near-surface temperature and pressure, at a target location apart from a data observation point. Our approach uses two prediction methods: reservoir computing (RC), known as a machine learning framework with low computational requirements, and vector autoregression models (VAR), recognized as a statistical method for analyzing time series data. Our results show that the accuracy of the predictions degrades with the distance between the observation and target locations. We quantitatively estimate the distance in which effective predictions are possible. We also find that in the context of climate data, a geographical distance is associated with data correlation, and a strong data correlation significantly improves the prediction accuracy with RC. In particular, RC outperforms VAR in predicting highly correlated data within the predictive range. These findings suggest that machine learning-based methods can be used more effectively to predict climatic elements in remote locations by assessing the distance to them from the data observation point in advance. Our study on low-cost and accurate prediction of climate variables has significant value for climate change strategies.</description>
