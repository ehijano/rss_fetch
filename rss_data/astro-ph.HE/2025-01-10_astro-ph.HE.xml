      <title>The Forward Physics Facility at the HL-LHC and its Synergies with Astroparticle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy collisions at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will generate a vast flux of particles along the beam collision axis, a region not accessible by current LHC experiments. The study of multi-particle production in the far-forward region is especially important for astroparticle physics. High-energy cosmic rays create extensive air showers (EAS) in the atmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions in the non-perturbative QCD regime. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic interactions in the forward region is crucial for interpreting EAS data and estimating backgrounds for searches of astrophysical neutrinos, among other applications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a new underground cavern at the HL-LHC, hosting various far-forward experiments designed to detect particles outside the current LHC acceptance. We will outline the current plans for the FPF and highlight its synergies with astroparticle physics. Specifically, we will discuss how FPF measurements will enhance the modeling of high-energy interactions in the atmosphere, helping to reduce the associated uncertainties in multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>From proto-neutron star dynamo to low-field magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-field magnetars have dipolar magnetic fields that are 10-100 times weaker than the threshold, $B \gtrsim 10^{14}$ G, used to define classical magnetars, yet they produce similar X-ray bursts and outbursts. Using the first direct numerical simulations of magneto-thermal evolution starting from a dynamo-generated magnetic field, we show that the low-field magnetars can be produced as a result of a Tayler--Spruit dynamo inside the proto-neutron star. We find that these simulations naturally explain key characteristics of low-field magnetars: (1) weak ($\lesssim 10^{13}$ G) dipolar magnetic fields, (2) strong small-scale fields, and (3) magnetically induced crustal failures producing X-ray bursts. These findings suggest two distinct formation channels for classical and low-field magnetars, potentially linked to different dynamo mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\gamma$-ray dissipation site in gravitationally lensed quasar -- PKS 1830$-$211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable $\gamma$-ray flares upto minute timescales reflect extreme particle acceleration sites. However, for high-redshift blazars, the detection of such rapid variations remains limited by current telescope sensitivities. Gravitationally lensed blazars serve as powerful tools to probe $\gamma$-ray production zones in distant sources, with time delays between lensed signals providing crucial insights into the spatial distribution of emission regions relative to the lens's mass-weighted center. We have utilized 15 years of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data from direction of PKS 1830$-$211 to understand the origin of flaring high-energy production zone at varying flux states. To efficiently estimate the (lensed) time delay, we used a machine learning-based tool - the Gaussian Process regression algorithm, in addition to - Autocorrelation function and Double power spectrum. We found a consistent time delay across all flaring activity states, indicating a similar location for the $\gamma$-ray emission zone, possibly within the radio core. The estimated time delay of approximately 20 days for the five flaring epochs was significantly shorter than previously estimated radio delays. This suggests that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone is closer to the central engine, in contrast to the radio emission zone, which is expected to be much farther away. A linear relationship between lag and magnification has been observed in the identified source and echo flares. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone originates from similar regions away from the site of radio dissipation.</description>

      <title>Impact of accretion-induced chemically homogeneous evolution on stellar and compact binary populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary star systems, mass transfer can spin up the accretor, possibly leading to efficient chemical mixing and chemically quasi-homogeneous evolution (CHE). Here, we explore the effects of accretion-induced CHE on both stellar populations and their compact binary remnants with the state-of-the-art population synthesis code SEVN. We find that CHE efficiently enhances the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) from secondary stars, which are spun-up by accretion, while simultaneously preventing their evolution into red supergiant stars (RSGs). Including CHE in our models increases the fraction of WRs in our stellar sample by nearly a factor of $\approx3$ at low metallicity ($Z=0.001$). WRs formed through CHE are, on average, more massive and luminous than those formed without CHE. Most WRs formed via CHE end their life as black holes. As a direct consequence, the CHE mechanism enhances the formation of binary black holes (BBHs) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) systems, while simultaneously quenching the production of binary neutron stars (BNSs). However, CHE significantly quenches the merger rate of BBHs, BHNSs and BNSs at low metallicity ($Z\leq{}0.004$), because most binary compact objects formed via CHE have large orbital periods. For instance, the number of BBH and BHNS mergers decreases by one order of magnitude at $Z=0.004$ in the CHE model compared to the standard scenario. Finally, we find that secondary stars experiencing CHE frequently produce the most massive compact object in the binary system. In BHNSs, this implies that the black hole progenitor is the secondary star. Conversely, BBHs formed through accretion-induced CHE likely have asymmetric black hole components, but only a negligible fraction of these asymmetric systems ultimately merge within an Hubble time.</description>

      <title>Effective resistivity in relativistic reconnection: a prescription based on fully kinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena are powered by the release -- via magnetic reconnection -- of the energy stored in oppositely directed fields. Single-fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with uniform resistivity yield dissipation rates that are much lower (by nearly one order of magnitude) than equivalent kinetic calculations. Reconnection-driven phenomena could be accordingly modeled in resistive MHD employing a non-uniform, ``effective'' resistivity informed by kinetic calculations. In this work, we analyze a suite of fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection -- where the magnetic energy is greater than the rest mass energy -- for different strengths of the guide field orthogonal to the alternating component. We extract an empirical prescription for the effective resistivity, $\eta_{\mathrm{eff}} = \alpha B_0 \mathbf{|J|}^p / \left(|\mathbf{J}|^{p+1}+\left(e n_t c\right)^{p+1}\right)$, where $B_0$ is the reconnecting magnetic field strength, $\bf J$ is the current density, $n_t$ the lab-frame total number density, $e$ the elementary charge, and $c$ the speed of light. The guide field dependence is encoded in $\alpha$ and $p$, which we fit to PIC data. This resistivity formulation -- which relies only on single-fluid MHD quantities -- successfully reproduces the spatial structure and strength of nonideal electric fields, and thus provides a promising strategy for enhancing the reconnection rate in resistive MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>GRB 241030A: a prompt thermal X-ray emission component and diverse origin of the very early UVOT WHITE and U band emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the long-duration GRB 241030A detected by {\it Swift}. Thanks to the rapid response of XRT and UVOT, the strongest part of the prompt emission of GRB 241030A has been well measured simultaneously from optical to hard X-ray band. The time-resolved WHITE band emission shows strong variability, largely tracing the activity of the prompt gamma-ray emission, may be produced by internal shocks too. The joint analysis of the XRT and BAT data reveals the presence of a thermal component with a temperature of a few keV, which can be interpreted as the photosphere radiation, and the upper limit of the Lorentz factor of this region is found to range between approximately 20 and 80. The time-resolved analysis of the initial U-band exposure data yields a very rapid rise ($ \sim t^{5.3}$) with a bright peak reaching 13.6 AB magnitude around 410 seconds, which is most likely attributed to the onset of the external shock emission. The richness and fineness of early observational data have made this burst a unique sample for studying the various radiation mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Peculiar radio-bright behaviour of the Galactic black hole transient 4U 1543-47 in the 2021-2023 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated behaviours between the radio emission and the X-ray emission in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) in the X-ray hard state are crucial to the understanding of disc-jet coupling of accreting black holes. The BH transient 4U 1543-47 went into outburst in 2021 following ~19 years of quiescence. We followed it up with ~weekly cadence with MeerKAT for about one year and a half until it faded into quiescence. Multi-epoch quasi-simultaneous MeerKAT and X-ray observations allowed us to trace the compact jet emission and its X-ray emission. In its hard spectral state across three orders of magnitude of X-ray luminosities above ~10$^{34}$ ergs/s, we found the correlation between radio and X-ray emission had a power-law index of 0.82$\pm$0.09, steeper than the canonical value of ~0.6 for BH XRBs. In addition, the radio vs. X-ray correlation shows a large range of the power-law normalization, with the maximum significantly larger than that obtained for most BH XRBs, indicating it can be particularly radio-bright and variable in the X-ray binary sample. The radio emission is unlikely diluted by discrete jet components. The observed peculiar radio-bright and variable behaviours provide the evidence for the relativistic effects of a variable Lorentz factor in the range between 1 and ~2 of the compact jet.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from r-mode oscillations of stochastically accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous gravitational radiation. We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the mechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps of matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not triggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised, one-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity. It is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state but sensitively on the rotation frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\rm rms} \approx 10^{-35} (\nu_{\rm s}/ 10 {\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\rm km})^2 (\Delta t_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm yr})^{1/2} (f_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\dot{M}/10^{-8} \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the strain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\Delta t_{\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted duration of an accretion episode, $f_{\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact frequency, $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is the distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of cosmic rays (CRs) and how they propagate remain unclear. Studying the propagation of CRs in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence can help to comprehend many open issues related to CR origin and the role of turbulent magnetic fields. To comprehend the phenomenon of slow diffusion in the near-source region, we study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field to reveal their universal laws. We numerically study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field, considering pulsar wind nebula as a general research case. Taking the magnetization parameter and turbulence spectral index as free parameters, together with radiative losses, we perform three group simulations to analyze the CR spectral, spatial distributions, and possible CR diffusion types. Our studies demonstrate that (1) CR energy density decays with both its effective radius and kinetic energy in the form of power-law distributions; (2) the morphology of the CR spatial distribution strongly depends on the properties of magnetic turbulence and the viewing angle; (3) CRs suffer a slow diffusion near the source and a fast/normal diffusion away from the source; (4) the existence of a power-law relationship between the averaged CR energy density and the magnetization parameter is independent of both CR energy and radiative losses; (5) radiative losses can suppress CR anisotropic diffusion and soften the power-law distribution of CR energy density. The distribution law established between turbulent magnetic fields and CRs presents an intrinsic property, providing a convenient way to understand complex astrophysical processes related to turbulence cascades.</description>

      <title>Time-Variant Vector Field Visualization for Magnetic Fields of Neutron Star Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel visualization application designed to explore the time-dependent development of magnetic fields of neutron stars. The strongest magnetic fields in the universe can be found within neutron stars, potentially playing a role in initiating astrophysical jets and facilitating the outflow of neutron-rich matter, ultimately resulting in the production of heavy elements during binary neutron star mergers. Since such effects may be dependent on the strength and configuration of the magnetic field, the formation and parameters of such fields are part of current research in astrophysics. Magnetic fields are investigated using simulations in which various initial configurations are tested. However, the long-term configuration is an open question, and current simulations do not achieve a stable magnetic field. Neutron star simulations produce data quantities in the range of several terabytes, which are both spatially in 3D and temporally resolved. Our tool enables physicists to interactively explore the generated data. We first convert the data in a pre-processing step and then we combine sparse vector field visualization using streamlines with dense vector field visualization using line integral convolution. We provide several methods to interact with the data responsively. This allows the user to intuitively investigate data-specific issues. Furthermore, diverse visualization techniques facilitate individual exploration of the data and enable real-time processing of specific domain tasks, like the investigation of the time-dependent evolution of the magnetic field. In a qualitative study, domain experts tested the tool, and the usability was queried. Experts rated the tool very positively and recommended it for their daily work.</description>

      <title>Sapphire++: A particle transport code combining a spherical harmonic expansion and the discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Sapphire++, an open-source code designed to numerically solve the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for astrophysical applications. Sapphire++ employs a numerical algorithm based on a spherical harmonic expansion of the distribution function, expressing the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as a system of partial differential equations governing the evolution of the expansion coefficients. The code utilises the discontinuous Galerkin method in conjunction with implicit and explicit time stepping methods to compute these coefficients, providing significant flexibility in its choice of spatial and temporal accuracy. We showcase the code's validity using examples. In particular, we simulate the acceleration of test particles at a parallel shock and compare the results to analytical predictions. The Sapphire++ code (https://github.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp) is available as a free and open-source tool for the community.</description>

      <title>Exploring the non-thermal physics behind the pulsar wind nebula PSR J2030+4415 through radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J2030+4415 is a gamma-ray pulsar with an X-ray pulsar wind nebula elongated along the north-south direction. The system shows a prominent X-ray filament oriented at an angle of 130{\deg} to the nebula axis. To improve our understanding of the non-thermal processes occurring in the pulsar wind nebula, we attempted to determine the possible existence of a radio counterpart, study its morphology, and obtain restrictive upper limits of the pulsar and filament emission at radio wavelengths. We performed observations of the pulsar PSR J2030+4415 and its surroundings with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at two frequency bands, and put the results in context with findings at other wavelengths. We obtained radio images at 736 and 1274 MHz that reveal a structure trailing the pulsar, with a morphology overlapping the X-ray nebula. This radio structure is the radio counterpart of the X-ray pulsar wind nebula. The derived spectral index along this structure shows spatial variation. There are no hints of the pulsar and the filament at any of the explored radio frequencies, but we obtained restrictive upper limits. A physical scenario that combines the radio and the X-ray observations, and consistent with IR data, of the nebula and the filament is presented. We propose that particle acceleration occurs in the nebula tail due to the presence of a re-collimation shock, and the highest energy particles gradually escape from it through energy-dependent diffusion. We also find a lower limit in the energy of the particles escaping along the X-ray filament of ~GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To power gamma-ray bursts and other high-energy events, large-scale magnetic fields are required to extract rotational energy from compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key mechanism for angular momentum transport and large-scale magnetic field amplification. Recent work has begun to address the regime of high magnetic Prandtl number $\mathrm{Pm}$, the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, in which angular momentum and magnetic energy increase with $\mathrm{Pm}$. This regime reveals unique dynamics of small-scale turbulence in disk mid-planes and buoyancy instabilities in the atmosphere. This study aims to build on these findings, focusing on the MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo in stratified simulations to understand magnetic field generation in the high-$\mathrm{Pm}$ regime. We analyze data taken from stratified shearing box simulations both in the regime of magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also in the high $\mathrm{Pm}$ regime employing new techniques to compute the dynamo coefficients. We find that the mean-magnetic field evolution can be described by an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo, even in the high-Pm regime. The mean magnetic field as well as the dynamo coefficients increase with Pm. This leads to a shorter dynamo period and a faster growth rate. We also find that the off-diagonal coefficients have an impact on the propagation of the magnetic field in the dynamo region. Overall, the magnetic field amplification found in global simulations should be increased by at least a factor of $\sim 5$, which could lead to more powerful jets and stronger winds from astrophysical disks in the high-Pm regime.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Solutions of Evolving Nuclear Star Clusters with Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo Dynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently developed a Monte-Carlo method (GNC) that can simulate the dynamical evolution of a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC) with a massive black hole (MBH), where the two-body relaxations can be solved by the Fokker-Planck equations in energy and angular momentum space. Here we make a major update of GNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that we can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the MBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass growth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous studies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\sim 17t_{\rm rh}$ by GNC, where $t_{\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study the cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH assuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars (e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the simulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by galaxies. Such scenario is possible to produce MBHs with mass $10^5\sim 10^7\,M_\odot$ for NSCs with stellar mass of $10^6\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$. In Milky-Way's NSC, to grow MBH up to $4\times 10^6\,M_\odot$, its size needs to be $\sim 1.7$ times more compact in early universe than the current value. MBHs with current masses $&gt;6\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$ seem difficult to explain by loss-cone accretion alone, and thus may require other additional accretion channels, such as gas accretion.</description>

      <title>A possible formation scenario of the Gaia ID 3425577610762832384: inner binary merger inside a triple common envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an identified non-interacting black hole (BH) binary, Gaia ID 3425577610762832384 (hereafter G3425), contains a BH ($\sim$3.6 M$_{\odot}$) falling within the mass gap and has a nearly circular orbit, challenging the classical binary evolution and supernova theory. Here, we propose that G3425 originates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The G3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49 M$_{\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\odot}$, and inner and outer orbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution proceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the orbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an additional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting for $\sim$97\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the outer orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to successfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54 M$_\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\odot$ helium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53 days. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected classical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully ejected helium star has a 44.2\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a non-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\odot}$ and a relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$ ${\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analytic solution to the gravitational-wave overlapping event rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration, posing significant challenges to data analysis. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping events. For the first time we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events to aid rapid and robust estimation. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Features and prospects for kilonova remnant detection with current and future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the observable spectral and temporal properties of kilonova remnants (KNRs) analytically, and point out quantitative differences with respect to supernova remnants. We provide detection prospects of KNRs in the context of ongoing radio surveys. We find that there is a good chance to expect tens of these objects in future surveys with a flux threshold of $\sim 0.1$ mJy. Kilonova remnants from a postulated population of long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants of neutron star mergers are even more likely to be detected, as they are extremely bright and peak earlier. For an ongoing survey with a threshold of $\sim$ 1 mJy, we expect to find tens to hundreds of such objects if they are a significant fraction of the total kilonova (KN) population. Considering that there are no such promising KN candidates in presently ongoing surveys, we constrain the fraction of these extreme KN to be no more than 30 percent of the overall KN population. This constraint depends sensitively on the details of ejecta mass and external density distribution.</description>

      <title>Strongly magnetized accretion with low angular momentum produces a weak jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spherical accretion of magnetized plasma with low angular momentum onto a supermassive black hole, utilizing global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Black hole-driven feedback in the form of magnetic eruptions and jets triggers magnetized turbulence in the surrounding medium. We find that when the Bondi radius exceeds a certain value relative to the black hole's gravitational radius, this turbulence restricts the subsequent inflow of magnetic flux, strongly suppressing the strength of the jet. Consequently, magnetically arrested disks and powerful jets are not a generic outcome of the accretion of magnetized plasma, even if there is an abundance of magnetic flux available in the system. However, if there is significant angular momentum in the inflowing gas, the eruption-driven turbulence is suppressed (sheared out), allowing for the presence of a powerful jet. Both the initially rotating and nonrotating flows go through periods of low and high gas angular momentum, showing that the angular momentum content of the inflowing gas is not just a feature of the ambient medium, but is strongly modified by the eruption and jet-driven black hole feedback. In the lower-angular-momentum states, our results predict that there should be dynamically strong magnetic fields on horizon scales, but no powerful jet; this state may be consistent with Sgr A* in the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Gamma-ray Burst Phenomenology on the Hypothesis of Quark Star as the central engine of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Searching for short-timescale radio anomalies using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine-learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. Our results show that the UMAP unsupervised machine learning pipeline effectively identifies anomalous signals in high-time-resolution datasets, highlighting its potential for use in future surveys. However, the pipeline is not applicable for standard searches for dispersed single pulses. We classify the detected events and, in particular, we are currently unable to determine the possible origin of events that last multiple seconds. For these we encourage follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>On the response of massive main sequence stars to mass accretion and outflow at high rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a one-dimensional stellar evolution model, we find that massive main-sequence stars can accrete mass at very high mass accretion rates without expanding much if they lose a significant fraction of this mass from their outer layers simultaneously with mass accretion. We assume the accretion process is via an accretion disk that launches powerful jets from its inner zones. These jets remove the outer high-entropy layers of the mass-accreting star. This process operates in a negative feedback cycle, as the jets remove more envelope mass when the star expands. With the one-dimensional model, we mimic the mass removal by jets by alternative mass addition and mass removal phases. For the simulated models of 30Mo and 60Mo, the star does not expand much if we remove more than about half of the added mass in not-too-short episodes. This holds even if we deposit the energy the jets do not carry into the envelope. As the star does not expand much, its gravitational potential well stays deep, and the jets are energetic. These results are relevant to bright transient events of binary systems powered by accretion and the launching of jets, e.g., intermediate luminosity optical transients, including some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>
