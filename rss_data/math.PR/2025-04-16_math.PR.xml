      <title>Efficient Rare-Event Simulation for Random Geometric Graphs via Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10530v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random geometric graphs defined on Euclidean subspaces, also called Gilbert graphs, are widely used to model spatially embedded networks across various domains. In such graphs, nodes are located at random in Euclidean space, and any two nodes are connected by an edge if they lie within a certain distance threshold. Accurately estimating rare-event probabilities related to key properties of these graphs, such as the number of edges and the size of the largest connected component, is important in the assessment of risk associated with catastrophic incidents, for example. However, this task is computationally challenging, especially for large networks. Importance sampling offers a viable solution by concentrating computational efforts on significant regions of the graph. This paper explores the application of an importance sampling method to estimate rare-event probabilities, highlighting its advantages in reducing variance and enhancing accuracy. Through asymptotic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, contributing to improved analysis of Gilbert graphs and showcasing the broader applicability of importance sampling in complex network analysis.</description>

      <title>Hessian descent for spherical spin glasses with uniform log-Sobolev disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work concerns spherical spin glass models with disorder satisfying a uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequality. We show that the Hessian descent algorithm introduced in~\cite{following21} can be extended to this setting, thanks to the abundance of small eigenvalues near the edge of the Hessian spectrum. Combined with the ground state universality recently proven in~\cite{sawhney_free_2024}, this implies that when the model is in the full-RSB phase, the Hessian descent algorithm can find a near-minimum with high probability.
  Our proof consists of two main ingredients. First, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of the Hessian converges to a semicircular law via the moment method. Second, we use the logarithmic Sobolev inequality to establish concentration and obtain uniform control of the spectral edge.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Limit of a Generally Distributed, Overloaded, Multiclass, Multi-server Random Order of Service Queue with Reneging, Obtained without State Space Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain stochastic differential equations that will be satisfied by the diffusion limit of a measure-valued state descriptor for a multiclass, multi-server, random order of service queue with reneging and general distributional requirements. We develop a methodology to represent queueing systems similar to this one in terms of time-changed renewal processes and pure jump martingales. Then, in a general setting, we give conditions for tightness and the form of the SDE satisfied by the subsequential diffusion limits of systems represented in this manner. Finally, we use this methodology on our particular model in order to obtain tightness and an SDE satisfied by its subsequential diffusion limits.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the exact asymptotic behavior of the connectivity probability in a random binomial bipartite graph $G(n,m,p)$ under various regimes of the edge probability $p=p(n)$. To determine this probability, a method based on the analysis of inhomogeneous random walks is proposed.</description>

      <title>On the genealogy of multi-type Cannings models and their limiting exchangeable coalescents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multi-type Cannings population model. Each individual has a type belonging to a given at most countable type space $E$. The population is hence divided into $|E|$ subpopulations. The subpopulation sizes are assumed to be constant over the generations, whereas the number of offspring of type $\ell\in E$ of all individuals of type $k\in E$ is allowed to be random. Under a joint exchangeability assumption on the offspring numbers, the transition probabilities of the ancestral process of a sample of individuals satisfy a multi-type consistency property, paving a way to prove in the limit for large subpopulation sizes the existence of multi-type exchangeable coalescent processes via Kolmogorov's extension theorem. Integral representations for the infinitesimal rates of these multi-type exchangeable coalescents and some of their properties are studied. Examples are provided, among them multi-type Wright-Fisher models and multi-type pure mutation models. The results contribute to the foundations of multi-type coalescent theory and provide new insights into (the existence of) multi-type exchangeable coalescents.</description>

      <title>Fisher information approximation of random orthogonal matrices by Gaussian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\Gamma}_n$ be an $n\times n$ Haar-invariant orthogonal matrix. Let ${ Z}_n$ be the $p\times q$ upper-left submatrix of ${\Gamma}_n$ and ${G}_n$ be a $p\times q$ matrix whose $pq$ entries are independent standard normals, where $p$ and $q$ are two positive integers. Let $\mathcal{L}(\sqrt{n} {Z}_n)$ and $\mathcal{L}({G}_n)$ be their joint distribution, respectively. Consider the Fisher information $I(\mathcal{L}(\sqrt{n} { Z}_n)|\mathcal{L}(G_n))$ between the distributions of $\sqrt{n} {Z}_n$ and ${ G}_n.$ In this paper, we conclude that $$I(\mathcal{L}(\sqrt{n} {Z}_n)|\mathcal{L}(G_n))\longrightarrow 0 $$ as $n\to\infty$ if $pq=o(n)$ and it does not tend to zero if $c=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{pq}{n}\in(0, +\infty).$ Precisely, we obtain that $$I(\mathcal{L}(\sqrt{n} {Z}_n)|\mathcal{L}(G_n))=\frac{p^2q(q+1)}{4n^2}(1+o(1))$$ when $p=o(n).$</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Zernike decay of Wilson line observables in the free phase of the \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) lattice Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the physics literature, the Wilson line observable is believed to have a phase transition between a region with pure exponential decay and a region with Ornstein-Zernike type corrections. In~\cite{f2024b}, we confirmed the first part of this prediction. In this paper, we complement these results by showing that if \( \kappa \) is small and \( \beta \) large compared to the length of the line, then Wilson line expectations have exponential decay with Ornstein-Zernike type behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a notion of universality for the parabolic Anderson model via an invariance principle for a wide family of parabolic stochastic partial differential equations. We then use this invariance principle in order to provide an asymptotic theory for a wide class of non-linear SPDEs. A novel ingredient of this invariance principle is the dissipativity of the underlying stochastic PDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $d\geq2$, we construct a Zariski-dense random walk on the space of lattices SL$_d(\mathbb{R})/$SL$_d(\mathbb{Z})$ that exhibits escape of mass. This negates the suggestion of recurrence made by Benoist [Ben14] (ICM 2014) and by B\'enard-de Saxc\'e [BS22] (also asked in [BQ12]). For any $p \in (0,1)$, we also construct such a random walk with finite $L^p$-moment which shows that the moment assumption in [BS22] is sharp.</description>

      <title>Hessian stability and convergence rates for entropic and Sinkhorn potentials via semiconcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we determine quantitative stability bounds for the Hessian of entropic potentials, i.e., the dual solution to the entropic optimal transport problem. Up to authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward diffusion processes, known as Schr\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability entropic estimates and integrated gradient estimates as well. Finally, as a direct consequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a problem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>Semi-asymptotic bounds for moderate deviations of suprema of Gaussian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use decoupling inequalities for general Gaussian vectors and classical tools from Gaussian processes theory to study moderate deviations of suprema of
  trigonometric and almost periodic
  Gaussian polynomials.
  Let \begin{eqnarray*} X_x(t) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{k\le x} a_k \,\big( g_k \cos 2\pi k \,t+ g'_k\sin 2\pi k \, t\, \big), \quad 0\le t\le 1, \ x&gt;0, \end{eqnarray*} where $(g_k)_{k\ge 1}$, $(g'_k)_{k\ge 1}$ are two independent sequences of i.i.d. $\mathcal N(0,1)$ distributed random variables, and $(a_k)_{k\ge 1}$ are real numbers such that $A_x = \sum_{k\le x} a_k^2\uparrow \infty$ with $x$.
  Assume for instance that $A(x)\sim \log\log x$, $x\to \infty$ and $B=\sum_{k\ge 1} a_k^4&lt;\infty$. Let $0&lt;\eta&lt; 1$. We prove that
  there exists an absolute constant $C$, such that for all $x$ large enough, \begin{align*}
  \P\Big\{ \sup_{0\le t\le 1}
  X_x(t) \le\sqrt{2\eta (\log\log x)(\log \log\log x)}\Big\}
  \ \le \ e^{-\,\frac{C (\log\log x)^{1-\eta}}{ \sqrt{8\eta (B+1)(\log \log\log x)}}}.
  \end{align*}
  We also establish an approximation theorem of moderate deviations of almost periodic Gaussian polynomials by Gaussian polynomials with $\Q$-frequencies, and show that the error term has an exponential decay.
  We finally study for general non-vanishing coefficient sequences, the behavior along lattices of almost periodic Gaussian polynomials with linearly independent frequencies.</description>

      <title>A new approach to stochastic McKean-Vlasov limits with low-regularity coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical measure flow of a McKean-Vlasov $n$-particle system with common noise is a measure-valued process whose law solves an associated martingale problem. We obtain a stability result for the sequence of martingale problems: all narrow cluster points of the sequence of laws solve the formally limiting martingale problem. Through the solution of the limiting problem, we are able to characterize the dynamics of limits of the empirical measure flows. A major new aspect of our result is that it requires rather weak regularity assumptions for the coefficients, for instance a form of local continuity of the drift in the measure argument and ellipticity of the diffusion coefficient for the idiosyncratic noise. In fact, the formally limiting martingale problem may fail to have any solution if there are discontinuities in the measure argument, so that the stability property is in general not true under low regularity assumptions. Our novel approach leverages an emergence of regularity property for cluster points of the empirical measure flow. This provides us with a priori analytic regularity estimates which we use to compensate for the low regularity of the drift.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the distribution of the telegraph meander, a random function obtained by conditioning the telegraph process to stay above the zero level. The reflection principle for finite-velocity random motions allows the law of the telegraph meander to be expressed in terms of the spatial derivative of the law of the telegraph process with initial negative velocity. As a result, we are able to obtain the characteristic function, the moments and the hyperbolic equation that governs the law of the telegraph meander. Furthermore, we prove that Brownian meander is the weak limit of the telegraph meander.</description>

      <title>Local elliptic regularity for solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations via Dirichlet forms and resolvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14636v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that, for a solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation with general coefficients, defined as a measure with an $L^2$-density, this density not only exhibits $H^{1,2}$-regularity but also H\"{o}lder continuity. To achieve this, we first construct a reference measure $\mu=\rho dx$ by utilizing existence and elliptic regularity results, ensuring that the given divergence-type operator corresponds to a sectorial Dirichlet form. By employing elliptic regularity results for homogeneous boundary value problems in both divergence and non-divergence type equations, we demonstrate that the image of the resolvent operator associated with the sectorial Dirichlet form has $H^{2,2}$-regularity. Furthermore, through calculations based on the Dirichlet form and the $H^{2,2}$-regularity of the resolvent operator, we prove that the density of the solution measure for the stationary Fokker-Planck equation is, indeed, the weak limit of $H^{1,2}$-functions defined via the resolvent operator. Our results highlight the central role of Dirichlet form theory and resolvent approximations in establishing the regularity of solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations with general coefficients.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in an Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open, one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ w.h.p. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges not yet 'seen' by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for all $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$, where $d$ is a large constant. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we further prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem by supporting the conjectured optimality of the aforementioned greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of tuples of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) commonly used as a barrier for classes of algorithms. While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are not stable and our application of OGP-based techniques to online setting is novel.</description>

Abstract: In decision making under uncertainty and risk, worst-case risk assessments are often conducted using maxitive monetary risk measures. In this article, we study maxitive monetary risk measures on the space $L^0$ of all random variables identified modulo almost sure equality. We prove that a monetary risk measure is maxitive and continuous from below if and only if it is a penalized maximum loss. Furthermore, we characterize the maximum loss as the unique maxitive and law-invariant monetary risk measure. We apply the results to large deviation theory by providing a general criterion to establish a sharp large deviation estimate for sequences of probability measures. We use these findings to provide a formula for the asymptotics of the distortion-exponential insurance premium principle under risk pooling.</description>

      <title>L\'evy-type operators with low singularity kernels: regularity estimates and martingale problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14056v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the linear non-local operator $\mathcal{L}$ denoted by \[ \mathcal{L} u (x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \left(u(x+z)-u(x)\right) a(x,z)J(z)\,d z. \] Here $a(x,z)$ is bounded and $J(z)$ is the jumping kernel of a L\'evy process, which only has a low-order singularity near the origin and does not allow for standard scaling. The aim of this work is twofold. Firstly, we introduce generalized Orlicz-Besov spaces tailored to accommodate the analysis of elliptic equations associated with $\mathcal{L}$, and establish regularity results for the solutions of such equations in these spaces. Secondly, we investigate the martingale problem associated with $\mathcal{L}$. By utilizing analytic results, we prove the well-posedness of the martingale problem under mild conditions. Additionally, we obtain a new Krylov-type estimate for the martingale solution through the use of a Morrey-type inequality for generalized Orlicz-Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>Stopping Times of Boundaries: Relaxation and Continuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of the free boundaries and the corresponding hitting times in the context of optimal stopping in discrete time. We first prove the continuity of the map from the boundaries to the expected value of the corresponding stopping policy both in the supremum norm and also in a weaker, novel topology induced by the relaxed $L^\infty$ metric that we introduce. The latter is particularly useful when the optimal stopping boundary is only proved to be semicontinuous. Secondly, we study the connection between the hitting times, and their relaxations as widely employed in recent numerical methods. All these results together with the universal approximation capability of neural networks and the notion of inf/sup convolution are then used to provide a convergence analysis for the algorithm in [Reppen, Soner, and Tissot-Daguette, Neural Optimal Stopping Boundary, 2025] for the numerical resolution of the exercise regions arising in the analysis of Bermudan type option.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a practical approach to stochastic Lie systems, i.e. stochastic differential equations whose general solutions can be written as a function depending only on a generic family of particular solutions and some constants related to initial conditions. We correct the stochastic Lie theorem characterising stochastic Lie systems proving that, contrary to previous claims, it retains its classical form in the Stratonovich approach. Meanwhile, we show that the form of stochastic Lie systems may significantly differ from the classical one in the It\^{o} formalism. New generalisations of stochastic Lie systems, like the so-called stochastic foliated Lie systems, are devised. Subsequently, we focus on stochastic Lie systems that are Hamiltonian systems relative to different geometric structures. Special attention is paid to the symplectic case. We study their stability properties and devise the basics of a stochastic energy-momentum method. A stochastic Poisson coalgebra method is developed to derive superposition rules for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. Potential applications of our results are shown for biological stochastic models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Lotka--Volterra systems, Palomba--Goodwin models, among others. Our findings complement previous approaches by using stochastic differential equations instead of deterministic equations designed to grasp some of the features of models of stochastic nature.</description>

Abstract: The well-posedness is established for multi-dimensional mean-field stochastic Volterra equations with Lipschitz continuous coefficients and allowing for singular kernels as well as for one-dimensional mean-field stochastic Volterra equations with H\"older continuous diffusion coefficients and sufficiently regular kernels.

      <description>arXiv:2310.03124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a two-player, nonzero-sum Dynkin game of stopping with incomplete information. We assume that each player observes his own Brownian motion, which is not only independent of the other player's Brownian motion but also not observable by the other player. The player who stops first receives a payoff that depends on the stopping position. Under appropriate growth conditions on the reward function, we show that there are infinitely many Nash equilibria in which both players attain infinite expected payoffs. In contrast, the only equilibrium with finite expected payoffs mandates immediate stopping by at least one of the players. Our results hold in the settings of both pure and mixed strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces graphemes for constructing and analyzing stochastic processes that describe the evolution of large dynamic graphs. Unlike graphons, which capture the static properties of dense graphs via exchangeability or subgraph densities, graphemes are capable of modeling the full space-time evolution of graphs. A grapheme is an equivalence class of triples: (Polish space, symmetric {0,1}-valued connection function, sampling probability measure). We focus on embeddings in ultrametric spaces, encoding the graph history and linking directly to population dynamics models. Graphemes utilize stronger equivalences (homeomorphism, isometry) than graphons. We construct grapheme-valued Markov processes as limits of finite graph evolutions, driven by Fleming-Viot, Dawson-Watanabe, and McKean-Vlasov analogues. We establish characterization via well-posed martingale problems, yielding strong Markov processes with the Feller property and continuous paths (diffusions). Duality relations involving coalescent processes are derived. We identify non-trivial equilibria, linked to classical distributions from population genetics. This framework extends [arXiv:1908.06241] by incorporating history, enabling rigorous analysis via martingale problems, and characterizing non-trivial long-term behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the integral Varadhan short-time formula for non-linear heat flow on measured Finsler manifolds. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first result establishing a Varadhan-type formula for non-linear semigroups. We do not assume the reversibility of the metric, and the distance function can be asymmetric. In this generality, we reveal that the probabilistic interpretation is well-suited for our formula; the probability that a particle starting from a set $A$ can be found in another set $B$ describes the distance from $A$ to $B$. One side of the estimates (the upper bound of the probability) is also established in the nonsmooth setting of infinitesimally strictly convex metric measure spaces satisfying the local Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property.</description>

Here, we summarise some of their amazing properties and discuss the corresponding Markov embedding problem, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous in time. In particular, we derive exact and explicit solutions for time-inhomogeneous Markov flows with non-commuting generator families of equal-input type and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-similar Markov trees constitute a remarkable family of random compact real trees carrying a decoration function that is positive on the skeleton. As the terminology suggests, they are self-similar objects that further satisfy a Markov branching property. They are built from the combination of the recursive construction of real trees by gluing line segments with the seminal observation of Lamperti, which relates positive self-similar Markov processes and Levy processes via a time change. They carry natural length and harmonic measures, which can be used to perform explicit spinal decompositions. Self-similar Markov trees encompass a large variety of random real trees that have been studied over the last decades, such as the Brownian CRT, stable Levy trees, fragmentation trees, and growth-fragmentation trees. We establish general invariance principles for Galton--Watson trees with integer types and illustrate them with many combinatorial classes of random trees that have been studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this "wrong sign" requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition". Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Expectation Inference for Efficient Uncertainty Quantification and History Matching of Transient Darcy Flows in Porous Media with Random Parameters Under Distribution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of Darcy flows using history matching is important for the evaluation and prediction of subsurface reservoir performance. Conventional methods aim to obtain the maximum a posterior or maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) using gradient-based, heuristic or ensemble-based methods. These methods can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems since forward simulation needs to be run iteratively as physical parameters are updated. In the current study, we propose a nonlinear expectation inference (NEI) method for efficient history matching and uncertainty quantification accounting for distribution or Knightian uncertainty. Forward simulation runs are conducted on prior realisations once, and then a range of expectations are computed in the data space based on subsets of prior realisations with no repetitive forward runs required. In NEI, no prior probability distribution for data is assumed. Instead, the probability distribution is assumed to be uncertain with prior and posterior uncertainty quantified by nonlinear expectations. The inferred result of NEI is the posterior subsets on which the expected flow rates are consistent with observation. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method are validated using single- and two-phase Darcy flows in 2D and 3D heterogeneous reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Point Processes and spatial statistics in time-frequency analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite-energy signal is represented by a square-integrable, complex-valued function $t\mapsto s(t)$ of a real variable $t$, interpreted as time. Similarly, a noisy signal is represented by a random process. Time-frequency analysis, a subfield of signal processing, amounts to describing the temporal evolution of the frequency content of a signal. Loosely speaking, if $s$ is the audio recording of a musical piece, time-frequency analysis somehow consists in writing the musical score of the piece. Mathematically, the operation is performed through a transform $\mathcal{V}$, mapping $s \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ onto a complex-valued function $\mathcal{V}s \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of time $t$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The squared modulus $(t, \omega) \mapsto \vert\mathcal{V}s(t,\omega)\vert^2$ of the time-frequency representation is known as the spectrogram of $s$; in the musical score analogy, a peaked spectrogram at $(t_0,\omega_0)$ corresponds to a musical note at angular frequency $\omega_0$ localized at time $t_0$. More generally, the intuition is that upper level sets of the spectrogram contain relevant information about in the original signal. Hence, many signal processing algorithms revolve around identifying maxima of the spectrogram. In contrast, zeros of the spectrogram indicate perfect silence, that is, a time at which a particular frequency is absent. Assimilating $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{C}$ through $z = \omega + \mathrm{i}t$, this chapter focuses on time-frequency transforms $\mathcal{V}$ that map signals to analytic functions. The zeros of the spectrogram of a noisy signal are then the zeros of a random analytic function, hence forming a Point Process in $\mathbb{C}$. This chapter is devoted to the study of these Point Processes, to their links with zeros of Gaussian Analytic Functions, and to designing signal detection and denoising algorithms using spatial statistics.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Stockwell Transform and its Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincar\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.</description>

Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is a sparse alternative to entropic regularization: the solution measure tends to have small support. Computational experience suggests that the support decreases monotonically to the unregularized counterpart as the regularization parameter is relaxed. We find it useful to investigate this monotonicity more abstractly for linear programs over polytopes, regularized with the squared norm. Here, monotonicity can be stated as an invariance property of the curve mapping the regularization parameter to the solution: once the curve enters a face of the polytope, does it remain in that face forever? We show that this invariance is equivalent to a geometric property of the polytope, namely that each face contains the minimum norm point of its affine hull. Returning to the optimal transport problem and its associated Birkhoff polytope, we verify this property for low dimensions, but show that it fails for marginals with five or more point masses. As a consequence, the conjectured monotonicity of the support fails in general, even if experiments suggest that monotonicity holds for many cost matrices. Separately, we apply our geometric point of view to a problem of Erd\H{o}s, namely to characterize the doubly stochastic matrices whose maximal trace equals their squared norm.</description>

      <title>Non-Reversible Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11743</link>

Abstract: We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from a target distribution on a constrained domain. We propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD), a continuous-time stochastic differential equation with skew-reflected boundary. We obtain non-asymptotic convergence rate of SRNLD to the target distribution in both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. By breaking reversibility, we show that the convergence is faster than the special case of the reversible dynamics. Based on the discretization of SRNLD, we propose skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC), and obtain non-asymptotic discretization error from SRNLD, and convergence guarantees to the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance. We show better performance guarantees than the projected Langevin Monte Carlo in the literature that is based on the reversible dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided for both synthetic and real datasets to show efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>
