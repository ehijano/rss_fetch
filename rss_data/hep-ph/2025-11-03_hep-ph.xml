      <title>Improved calculation of radiative corrections to $\boldsymbol{\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable calculation of radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays is an important prerequisite for using hadronic $\tau$ decays for a data-driven evaluation of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this Letter, we present an improved model-independent analysis of these radiative corrections, including, for the first time, effects beyond point-like pions in the evaluation of the loop diagrams. These structure-dependent corrections, implemented via a dispersive representation of the pion form factor, lead to significant changes compared to previous calculations due to enhancements near the $\rho(770)$ resonance. We also devise strategies for the matching to chiral perturbation theory and a stable implementation of the real corrections down to the two-pion threshold, which shows that some higher-order isospin-breaking corrections need to be kept due to a strong threshold enhancement. Finally, we perform dispersive fits to the currently available $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectra and discuss the consequences for isospin-breaking corrections in the evaluation of $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Running Couplings in High-Temperature Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalization-group evolution of parameters in the three-dimensional effective field theory (3D EFT) that describes the thermally driven electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field. We focus on the first-order case, triggered by beyond the Standard Model physics. We compute the two-loop running of the 3D EFT couplings, including the effect of the leading non-renormalizable terms. We then analyze how the new contributions to the beta functions compare with those in the super-renormalizable case, highlighting their impact on perturbative computations of the scalar potential, which describes the vacuum structure of the theory. By incorporating higher-order corrections in the mass parameter evolution, as well as the running of other effective operators, we set the stage for testing their impact on phase transition dynamics in lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>All is More: Energy Flow Networks for Jet Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet quenching, the modification of jets by the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions, provides a sensitive probe of the properties of the medium. A jet-by-jet discrimination study between proton-proton and lead-lead jets using energy flow networks and simple baselines, explicitly retaining medium response and underlying event contamination is presented. As references, linear discriminants and neural networks have been trained on high-level observables such as $N$-subjettiness and energy flow polynomials, including an extended energy flow polynomial set, in order to quantify the achievable performance without constituent-level learning. Energy flow networks are then trained on jet constituents and extended to observable-enhanced energy flow networks that concatenate standardized $N$-subjettiness and/or energy flow polynomials to the energy flow network latent space. In the realistic scenario, including both underlying event contamination and medium response, observable-enhanced energy flow networks set state-of-the-art performance with receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of $\simeq 0.83$, improving markedly over linear and non-linear baselines and previous work with different architectures. Finally, results from moment energy flow networks, an energy flow network variant that attains comparable area under the curve with a substantially more compact and interpretable latent space are shown. These results establish energy-flow-network-based approaches (especially when enhanced with physics-motivated observables) as practical and robust tools for jet-quenching studies.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic tomography of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm strange pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how quarks are spatially arranged inside exotic pentaquarks remains one of the key open problems in contemporary hadron spectroscopy. The electromagnetic multipole moments of hadrons provide a direct probe of their internal quark--gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions. Motivated by this, we employ QCD light-cone sum rules to compute the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $J^P = 3/2^-$ pentaquark with strangeness $S = -1$. Five distinct diquark--diquark--antiquark interpolating currents are constructed to explore possible internal configurations. The resulting electromagnetic moments exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the underlying quark arrangement: magnetic dipole moments range from $-2.28\mu_N$ to $+3.36\mu_N$, establishing this observable as a key discriminator among configurations with identical quantum numbers. Nonzero electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments indicate clear deviations from spherical symmetry, while a detailed decomposition shows that light quarks dominate the magnetic response and the charm quark drives quadrupole deformation. These findings position electromagnetic multipole moments as quantitative and discriminating probes of exotic hadron structure, providing concrete benchmarks for forthcoming LHCb, Belle~II, and lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived HNLs via ALP Portal at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) and axion-like particles (ALPs) are both considered well-motivated candidates for beyond the standard model (BSM) physics. ALPs with couplings to gluons will be abundantly produced at the LHC. Therefore, HNLs produced via the ALP portal may provide unprecedented sensitivities to HNL parameters. Here, we study the prospects for the high-luminosity LHC to search for long-lived HNLs. We consider future far detectors as well as ATLAS in our simulations. In the limit where the ALP mass is large, HNLs are effectively produced by a dimension-8 operator connecting HNL pairs to gluons. For completeness, we therefore also calculate future LHC sensitivities for HNLs produced via $N_R$SMEFT operators with gluons.</description>

      <title>Spectra of light and heavy mesons with $J \le 5$ in a relativistic Bethe-Salpeter approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the range of application of the relativistic Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach from previously discussed mesons with total angular momentum $J \le 3$ to the ones with $J=4,5$. On a technical level, the new element is the general Dirac tensor representations for the latter which, to our knowledge, are presented here for the first time. As a first application, we provide an exploratory spectrum for these mesons in a rainbow-ladder truncation of Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We discuss the merits and limitations of this truncation and explore the shape of the heavy-quark potential corresponding to the underlying effective running coupling. With our predictions for the masses of ground state mesons with quantum numbers $J^{P,C}=3^{--}, 4^{++}, 5^{--}$ we identify Regge trajectories in channels where the interaction model can be trusted on a semi-quantitative level. In other channels, discrepancies with experiments confirm the well-known need to go beyond rainbow-ladder in the Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach by using more sophisticated interactions.</description>

      <title>Improved phenomenology of $\pi N$ transition distribution amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study cross sections and polarization asymmetries for the processes $e p \to e n \pi^+$ and $e p \to e p \pi^0$ in the backward region, we develop a flexible phenomenological model for nucleon-to-pion transition distribution amplitudes ($\pi N$ TDAs), which are used in the QCD collinear factorization description of the scattering amplitudes. Our model is based on the two-component factorized Ansatz for the corresponding spectral densities, quadruple distribution. It takes into account the constraints for $\pi N$ TDAs arising from the threshold pion production theorem and also includes a forward limit contribution that can be fitted to experimental data. We examine the sensitivity of observable predictions to various modelling assumptions.</description>

      <title>Classifying extended Higgs models through the trilinear Higgs boson coupling measurement at future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the trilinear Higgs boson coupling derived from the functional forms of various extended Higgs potentials. In light of experimental constraints on Higgs boson couplings, we focus on extended Higgs models in which the trilinear Higgs boson coupling is predominantly determined by the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field. Such models include the nearly aligned Higgs effective field theory, classically scale-invariant models, pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson scenarios, tadpole-induced models, and others. We also consider higher-order corrections, including top quark and new particle contributions that are often neglected, and discuss their impact on the trilinear Higgs boson coupling. Finally, we show to what extent the functional forms of the Higgs potentials can be probed at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Infrared singularities of multileg amplitudes with a massive particle at three loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the complete three-loop QCD soft anomalous dimension for multileg amplitudes involving a single massive coloured particle and any number of massless ones. This is achieved by applying a novel strategy based on a lightcone expansion of correlators of semi-infinite Wilson lines using the method of regions. The resulting region integrals depend exclusively on rescaling-invariant ratios that remain finite in the limit. We evaluate these integrals using differential equation techniques. The result is written in terms of uniform weight five generalised polylogarithms of a twelve letter alphabet in three variables, and is compatible with the massless limit as well as with two- and three-particle collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of inflation and freeze-in dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of $\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.</description>

      <title>From photons to dikaon -- theoretical insights into $K^+K^-$ production in nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of charged kaon pairs in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions can proceed via photoproduction (gamma-Pomeron interaction) or via photon-photon fusion. An important contribution to this process arises from the decays of scalar, tensor and vector mesons. This study provides a consistent description of K+K- production at both the elementary level (gamma gamma -&gt; meson -&gt; K+K-) and the nuclear level (Pb Pb -&gt; Pb Pb K+K-). The gamma gamma fusion cross section is compared with experimental results from Belle, TPC/Two-Gamma and ARGUS. A comparison with existing midrapidity measurements is presented, together with theoretical predictions for ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 5.02 TeV.</description>

      <title>Beyond Leading Logarithms in $g_V$: The Semileptonic Weak Hamiltonian at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\,\alpha_s^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first next-to-leading-logarithmic QCD analysis of the electromagnetic corrections to the semileptonic weak Hamiltonian, including the mixed $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\,\alpha_s^2)$ corrections to the vector coupling $g_V$. The analysis combines the evaluation of three-loop anomalous dimensions and two-loop matching corrections with a consistent factorization of short-distance QCD effects. The latter is implemented through a scheme change based on a $d$-dimensional operator product expansion performed inside the loop integrals. The resulting renormalization-group--improved expression for the radiative correction $\Delta^V_R = 2.432(16)\%$ can be systematically refined using input from lattice QCD and perturbation theory and improves the consistency of first-row CKM unitarity tests.</description>

      <title>Soft Gravitons, Hard Truths: Infrared Safety of Particle Processes in a Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are thought to propagate unattenuated through matter due to a cancellation between graviton absorption and stimulated emission inferred from leading-order soft-graviton arguments. We revisit this reasoning and show that it fails for the converse problem: the effect of a gravitational-wave background on matter. For unstable particles, real graviton emission \emph{and} absorption appear to enhance decay rates. By extending the soft-graviton framework describing real and virtual processes in a gravitational wave background, and resumming them to all orders, we show that inclusive decay rates remain essentially unchanged. The mutual transparency between matter and gravitational radiation thus follows from infrared safety, and not from a fortuitous cancellation in the lowest-order approximation of exclusive rates.</description>

      <title>WallGo investigates: Theoretical uncertainties in the bubble wall velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine theoretical uncertainties in state-of-the-art calculations of the bubble wall velocity during first-order cosmological phase transitions. By utilising the software WallGo for two extensions of the Standard Model, we find several $\mathcal{O}(1)$ uncertainties arising from the number of particles taken out of equilibrium, the logarithmically and power enhanced collision integrals, the treatment of thermal masses, the nucleation temperature, the $\tanh$ ansatz, and the perturbative order of the effective potential. However, we show that the linearisation of the Boltzmann equations is generally a good approximation with much smaller associated errors. We further clarify the limitations of the quasiparticle approximation in regions with negative mass squared. This study provides a detailed uncertainty budget and highlights where future efforts should be directed to improve the reliability of wall velocity and hence gravitational wave predictions.</description>

      <title>On the adiabatic initial conditions for a particle gas in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of recent interest in the role of "dark" radiation in cosmology, such as cosmic gravitational waves, sterile neutrinos, and dark photons, we clarify the definition of adiabatic initial conditions in the kinetic theory of gases in an expanding universe. Without assuming any form for the phase space distribution function, we identify two possibilities: a strong and a weak adiabatic initial condition. The strong one corresponds to the standard adiabatic initial conditions, while the weak one is related to the strong via internal isocurvature fluctuations. We show that both types of adiabatic initial conditions are consistent with the separate universe approach, although the latter requires initial internal isocurvature. In passing, we stress the importance of using the particle local momentum in the phase space to define the notion of adiabatic initial conditions. Doing so, we clarify that a gas of gravitons can have adiabatic initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Lattice Calculation of Light Meson Radiative Leptonic Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the branching ratios and the form factors of radiative leptonic decays $P \to \ell \nu_\ell \gamma$ ($P = \pi, K$) using $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion ensembles generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations at the physical pion mass. We adopt the infinite volume reconstruction (IVR) method, which extends lattice data to infinite volume and effectively controls the finite volume effects. This study represents a first step toward a complete calculation of radiative corrections to leptonic decays using the IVR method, including both real photon emissions and virtual photon loops. For decays involving a final state electron, collinear radiative corrections, enhanced by the large logarithmic factors such as $\ln(m_\pi^2/m_e^2)$ and $\ln(m_K^2/m_e^2)$, can reach the level of $O(10\%)$ and are essential at the current level of theoretical and experimental precision. After including these corrections, our result for $\pi \to e\nu_e\gamma$ agrees with the PIBETA measurement; for \(K \to e\nu_e\gamma\), our results are consistent with the KLOE data and exhibit a $1.7\sigma$ tension with E36; and for $K \to \mu\nu_\mu\gamma$, where radiative corrections are negligible, our results confirm the previously observed discrepancies between lattice results and the ISTRA/OKA measurements at large photon energies, and with the E787 results at large muon photon angles.</description>

      <title>$Q$-ball superradiance: Analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that waves scattering off a $Q$-ball can extract energy from it. We present an analytical treatment of this process by adopting a multi-step function approximation for the background field, which yields perturbative solutions expressed in terms of Bessel functions. For thin-wall $Q$-balls, the amplification factors reduce to simple sinusoidal functions, which explains the multi-peak structure of the spectrum and identifies the physical quantities that determine it. For instance, at high frequencies, the peak spacing is simply the inverse of the $Q$-ball size. The analytical solution further enables us to delineate the full range of possible amplification factors. For general $Q$-balls, this analytical framework also substantially improves the efficiency of evaluating the amplification factors.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoders for cosmological model discrimination and anomaly detection in cosmic microwave background power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background power spectra are a primary window into the early universe. However, achieving interpretable, likelihood-compatible compression and fast inference under weak model assumptions remains challenging. We propose a parameter-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) that aligns a data-driven latent representation with cosmological parameters while remaining compatible with standard likelihood analyses. The model achieves high-fidelity compression of the $D_\ell^{TT}$, $D_\ell^{EE}$, and $D_\ell^{TE}$ spectra into just 5 latent dimensions, with reconstruction accuracy exceeding $99.9\%$ within Planck uncertainties. It reliably reconstructs spectra for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios, even under parameter extrapolation, and enables rapid inference, reducing the computation time from $\sim$40 hours to $\sim$2 minutes while maintaining posterior consistency. The learned latent space demonstrates a physically meaningful structure, capturing a distributed representation that mirrors known cosmological parameters and their degeneracies. Moreover, it supports highly effective unsupervised discrimination among cosmological models, achieving performance competitive with supervised approaches. Overall, this physics-informed CVAE enables anomaly detection beyond $\Lambda$CDM and points to physically meaningful directions for refinement.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-photon coupling from the Global 21-cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A radiation field can be excited via parametric resonance when an oscillating axion field couples to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons interaction. As demonstrated in previous works, this mechanism can generate primordial magnetic fields shortly after recombination and provide sufficient ultraviolet radiation for the formation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). In this study, I analyze constraints on the parametric resonance scenario from global 21cm observations. I find that there exist viable regions in the parameter space that satisfy both observational limits and the physical requirements of the magnetic field and DCBH formation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian QFT: relativistic scattering and symmetry structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitarity is a cornerstone of quantum theory, ensuring the conservation of probability and information. Although non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically associated with open or dissipative systems, pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics shows that real spectra and unitary evolution can still emerge through a suitably defined inner product. Motivated by this insight, we extend the pseudo-Hermitian framework to relativistic quantum field theory and construct a consistent formulation of scattering processes. A novel structural feature of this theory is the presence of distinct metric operators for the in and out sectors, connected through a nontrivial metric projector that guarantees global probability conservation under pseudo-unitary time evolution. We further develop a general symmetry formalism, showing that each symmetry generally corresponds to two pseudo-unitary operators associated with the in and out metrics, respectively. Within this framework, the scattering matrix admits a perturbative expansion through the Dyson series and remains Lorentz invariant and unitary, remarkably in complete agreement with the conventional Hermitian case. The fundamental CPT theorem is also shown to hold. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for interacting pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories and open new directions for exploring their possible physical implications beyond the standard Hermitian paradigm.</description>

      <title>Earth-lens telescope for distant axion-like particle sources with stimulated backward reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel telescope concept based on Earth's gravitational lensing effect, optimized for the detection of distant dark matter sources, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). When a unidirectional flux of dark matter passes through Earth at sufficiently high velocity, gravitational lensing can concentrate the flux at a distant focal region in space. Our method combines this lensing effect with stimulated backward reflection (SBR), arising from ALP decays that are induced by directing a coherent electromagnetic beam toward the focal point. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze the structure of the focal region and to develop a framework for estimating the sensitivity to ALP-photon coupling via this mechanism. Numerical calculations show that, assuming an average ALP velocity of 520,km/s -- as suggested by the observed stellar stream S1 -- the focal region extends from $9 \times 10^9$,m to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$,m, with peak density near $9.6 \times 10^9$,m. For a conservative point-like ALP source located approximately 8,kpc from the solar system, based on the S1 stream, the estimated sensitivity in the eV mass range reaches $g/M = \mathcal{O}(10^{-22}),\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This concept thus opens a path toward a general-purpose, space-based ALP observatory that could, in principle, detect more distant sources -- well beyond $\mathcal{O}(10),\mathrm{kpc}$ -- provided that ALP-photon coupling is sufficiently strong, that is, $M \ll M_\mathrm{Planck}$.</description>

      <title>Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environment Around Black Holes From Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance requires physical states to be composite, even in the weak sector of the Standard Model (SM). The Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi (FMS) mechanism resolves this subtlety and predicts additional Higgs contributions in SM processes. While this has been supported by theoretical investigations in the bosonic sector, its impact on fermionic observables remains largely unexplored. We use non-perturbative lattice techniques within a gauge-invariant framework to study a proxy theory of the weak sector with dynamical fermions. We determine the physical spectrum of the theory and interpret the results in the context of the FMS mechanism. Additionally, we identify suitable simulation points for a scattering analysis as a first step toward cross-sections relevant to (future lepton) colliders.</description>

      <title>Holographic equation of state matched with hadron gas equation as a tool for the study of the quark-gluon plasma evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the matching of the holographic equation of state with the equation of Hadron Resonance Gas for studying the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Machine learning methods are applied to the calibration of model's free parameters using the lattice QCD results for the physical values of quark masses. One of the most advanced procedures for matching is used with the function that approximate behavior of both models on particular limit adopted from NEOS equation. Final hadronic spectra are obtained within multi-staged numerical approach of the iEBE-MUSIC and SMASH-vHLLE packages. The code of relativistic hydrodynamics is modified by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches are utilized at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean time. In this work, we investigate how the presence of cosmic strings can catalyze the decay process. To this end, we consider a complex scalar field charged under a global or local $U(1)$ symmetry. Assuming a non-trivial vacuum manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field. Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

Abstract: Polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is a key process in the quest for a resolution of the proton spin puzzle. We present the complete results for the polarized SIDIS process at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Our analytical results include all partonic channels for the scattering of polarized leptons off hadrons and a spin-averaged hadron identified in the final state. A numerical analysis of the NNLO corrections illustrates their significance and the reduced residual scale dependence in the kinematic range probed by the future Electron-Ion-Collider EIC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Leptogenesis and Dark Matter in the presence of an extra singlet complex scalar field in an extended discrete $\mathcal{Z_{\rm 3}}$ symmetry. The vacuum expectation value of the new scalar spontaneously breaks the $\mathcal{Z_{\rm 3}}$ symmetry. A remnant CP-like $\mathcal{Z_{\rm 2}}$ symmetry stabilizes the imaginary part of the complex scalar field which can act as a pseudo-Goldstone DM. The real part of the complex scalar couples to RHN opens up new decay channels which can lead to a larger CP-violation in generating the lepton asymmetry. Thus the singlet complex scalar plays a crucial role in understanding the Leptogenesis and Dark Matter parameter space. This singlet complex scalar is also responsible for the First-Order Phase Transition (FOPT) which may provide observable stochastic Gravitational wave signatures. We discuss the possible correlations among these three phenomena.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD corrections to unpolarized and polarized SIDIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process requires the presence of an identified hadron H$'$ in the final state, which arises from the scattering of a lepton with an initial hadron P. By employing factorization in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), SIDIS provides essential knowledge on the hadron structure, enabling the exploration of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). The coefficient functions for SIDIS can be calculated in perturbative QCD and are currently known to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for the cases, where the incoming lepton and the hadron P are either both polarized or unpolarized. We present a detailed description of these NNLO computations, including a thorough discussion of all the partonic channels, the calculation of the amplitudes and master integrals for the phase-space integration as well as the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences and mass factorization of infrared divergences in dimensional regularization through NNLO. We provide an extensive phenomenological analysis of the effects of NNLO corrections on SIDIS cross sections for different PDFs and FFs and various kinematics, including those of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We find that these corrections are not only significant but also crucial for reducing the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ to obtain stable predictions.</description>

      <title>Apples to Apples in Jet Quenching: robustness of Machine Learning classification of quenched jets to Underlying Event contamination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in the theoretical understanding of parton branching dynamics within an expanding Quark Gluon Plasma relies on detailed and fair comparisons with experimental data for reconstructed jets. Such comparisons are only meaningful when the computed jet, be it analytically or via event generation, accounts for the complexity of jets reconstructed in the challenging environment of heavy-ion collisions. Jet reconstruction in heavy ion collisions involves a necessarily imperfect subtraction of the large and fluctuating underlying event: reconstructed jets always include underlying event contamination. To identify true jet quenching effects, modifications due to the interaction of the branching partonic system with the Quark Gluon Plasma, we establish a baseline that accounts for possible background contamination on unmodified jets. In practical terms, jet quenching effects are only those not present in jets produced in proton-proton collisions that have been embedded in a realistic heavy-ion background and where subtraction has been carried out analogously to that in the heavy ion case. With this setup, we assess the sensitivity to underlying event of commonly discussed jet quenching observables and its impact on the robustness of Machine Learning studies, aimed at classifying jets according to their degree of modification by the Quark Gluon Plasma, that rely on those observables. We find the discrimination power of a simple Boosted Decision Tree to be robust in the realistic scenario where both medium response and underlying event are present, giving support to portability to the experimental context.</description>

Abstract: The search for light scalar and pseudoscalar particles not only provides a promising avenue for probing physics beyond the Standard Model, but also enables a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, thereby offering a viable mechanism to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this study, we investigate exotic decay channels of the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson into pairs of light CP-odd or CP-even Higgs bosons within the framework of GNMSSM. A comprehensive parameter space scan is performed using the MultiNest algorithm, incorporating constraints from HiggsSignals-2.6.2, HiggsBounds-5.10.2 and ATLAS experimental searches, under two distinct scenarios(one in which the observed Higgs boson corresponds to the lighter CP-even state, and another where it is identified with the heavier state). Our results demonstrate that HiggsBounds imposes the most stringent exclusion limits due to its sensitivity to direct searches for non-Standard Model Higgs bosons. Furthermore, dark matter phenomenology indicates that Singlino- or Higgsino-dominated DM is viable in the h_1 scenario, whereas the $h_2$ scenario favors Higgsino-dominated DM.</description>

Abstract: In response to the capabilities presented by the High-Intensity Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) and the Accelerator-Driven Subcritical System (CiADS), as well as the proposed Chinese Advanced Nuclear Physics Research Facility (CNUF), we are assembling a consortium of experts in relevant discipline--both domestically and internationally--to delineate high-precision physics experiments that leverage the state-of-the-art research environment afforded by CNUF. Our focus encompasses six primary domains of inquiry: hadron physics--including endeavors such as the super eta factory and investigations into light hadron structures; muon physics; neutrino physics; neutron physics; the testing of fundamental symmetries; and the exploration of quantum effects within nuclear physics, along with the utilization of vortex accelerators. We aim to foster a well-rounded portfolio of large, medium, and small-scale projects, thus unlocking new scientific avenues and optimizing the potential of the Huizhou large scientific facility. The aspiration for international leadership in scientific research will be a guiding principle in our strategic planning. This initiative will serve as a foundational reference for the Institute of Modern Physics in its strategic planning and goal-setting, ensuring alignment with its developmental objectives while striving to secure a competitive edge in technological advancement. Our ambition is to engage in substantive research within these realms of high-precision physics, to pursue groundbreaking discoveries, and to stimulate progress in China's nuclear physics landscape, positioning Huizhou as a preeminent global hub for advanced nuclear physics research.</description>

      <title>Role of the short-range dynamics in simultaneous interpretation of $P_{cs}$ pentaqurks via $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm molecular states in $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ systems using the one-boson exchange model. By regulating the short-range interactions with parameter $a$ and cutoff $\Lambda$, we found ten bound states in isoscalar systems. Our analysis reveals that if the LHCb Collaboration's $P_{cs}(4459)$ and Belle Collaboration's $P_{cs}(4472)$ pentaqurks are indeed distinct states, their mass splitting can be resolved through $\Xi_c^{\prime}\bar{D}$-$\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$ coupled channel dynamics using consistent model parameters. This framework assigns $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ spin-parity quantum numbers to $P_{cs}(4459)$ and $P_{cs}(4472)$, respectively. With this consistent model parameter, we predict several new molecular candidates in the $4.3-4.7$ GeV mass region, demonstrating the crucial interplay between coupled channel effects and short-range dynamics in understanding hidden-charm pentaquarks as hadronic molecules. Additionally, we investigate the effects of $\Lambda\eta_c$ and $\Lambda J/\psi$ decay channels on the predicted molecular states, showing how these channels influence pole positions and provide insights into the detectability of these states through different production mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We study the string theory dynamics of the volume scalar rolling down an exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating, in a background of cosmic superstring loops. In the context of the LVS potential, we demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution, in which 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the standard radiation tracker). On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in the string tension as the volume scalar evolves that makes the loops stable against decay. For more general non-LVS potentials, mixed radiation-loop trackers can also occur.</description>

      <title>Probing the low mass pseudoscalar in flipped Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenology of the flipped two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) is relatively less explored so far, as compared to the other, commonly discussed, types. It is found that this scenario, like several others, admits of a light neutral pseudoscalar $A$ in the mass range 20 - 60 GeV, consistently with all current experimental data and theoretical constraints. However, the fact that such a pseudoscalar decays overwhelmingly into a $b\bar{b}$ pair makes its identification at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) a challenging task. After identifying the region of the flipped 2HDM parameter space yielding a light pseudoscalar, we identify a useful search channel in the process $pp \rightarrow A Z(Z^{*}) \rightarrow b\bar{b} \ell^+ \ell^-$. A cut-based analysis, followed by one based on Boosted Decision Trees, shows that the light-$A$ scenario in flipped 2HDM should be detectable with rather high statistical significance at the high-luminosity LHC run, even after including systematic uncertainties. Furthermore, part of the parameter space, especially around $m_A = 30 - 40$ GeV is amenable to detection at the discovery level within Run-2 itself.</description>

      <title>Inclusive open charm photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC with G$\gamma$A-FONLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the inclusive $D^{0}$ production cross section in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC as a function of the $D^{0}$ transverse momentum and rapidity. These calculations are carried out within the new G$\gamma$A-FONLL (Generalized Photon-Nucleus FONLL) framework, which can predict photonuclear cross sections for charm and beauty hadrons in electron-proton, electron-nucleus, and ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions. The framework relies on FONLL (Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm) to model heavy-quark production in photonuclear collisions and employs a photon-flux reweighting procedure to describe the production cross sections in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions. The G$\gamma$A calculations are first validated against the photoproduction cross sections of $D^{*}$ in electron-proton collisions at HERA. The predictions for the $D^{0}$ production cross section in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC are then presented and compared to the first experimental results obtained by CMS at $\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}=5.36$ TeV. The predictions are benchmarked against different choices of nuclear parton distribution functions, fragmentation functions, and renormalization and factorization scales.</description>

      <title>ALPy Cogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis scenario by utilising the two-body decay of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) via an effective operator involving an axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) and a light chiral fermion $\nu_R$. This allows the two-body decay of heavy RHN into $\nu_R$ and ALP thereby generating a lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ which later gets transferred to left-handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left-handed leptons is then converted into baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. Successful leptogenesis constrain the parameter space in terms of RHN mass and axion decay constant. This has interesting consequences for both ALP and QCD axion DM parameter space within reach of several ongoing and near future experiments. We also propose a Dirac version of this scenario without any total lepton number violation. This leads to a long-lived asymmetric Dirac fermion contributing partially to DM thereby opening up more parameter space for ALP. In addition to axion search experiments, the proposed scenarios can have observable signatures at cosmic microwave background (CMB), DM search as well as terrestrial particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Local spin polarization by color-field correlators and momentum anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local spin polarization of quarks induced by color-field correlators stemming from the correlation of chromo-Lorentz force and chromo-magnetic polarization or chromo-spin Hall effect in the presence of momentum anisotropy. Such effects can trigger longitudinal polarization from fluctuating color fields in glasma or quark gluon plasma phases with transverse expansion for relativistic heavy ion collisions. Especially, from the glasma effect, the resulting longitudinal polarization spectrum of $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons has a sinusoidal structure with twice the azimuthal angle relative to the anisotropic direction. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the effect aligns with experimental observations. Our findings highlight the significant role of coherent gluon fields as a novel source for spin polarization phenomena in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Violating Higgs Decays in a Minimal Doublet Left-Right Symmetric Model with an Inverse Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyse the lepton flavor violation (LFV) decays within the framework of the Doublet Left-Right Symmetric model (DLRSM), based on the gauge group SU\left(2\right)_{L}\otimes SU\left(2\right)_{R}\otimes U\left(1\right)_{B-L}. The model features an extended gauge and scalar sector, including a bidoublet and two doublets which induce new charged currents interactions. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) occurs in two stages, introducing a new scale associated with the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the right-handed doublet v_{R} assumed to lie above the electroweak scale. Neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism, allowing sizeable mixing between active and sterile neutrinos. We diagonalize the full neutrino mass matrix and express the mixing in terms of physical parameters. We compute the branching ratios for LFV Higgs decays as functions of the heavy neutrino mass scale. Our numerical analysis incorporates current experimental bounds and projected sensitivities, highlighting viable regions of parameter space where LFV signals could be observed at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Unitarization of the Sommerfeld enhancement through the renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a pair of dark matter particles interacts via a long-range force mediated by a light particle, their nonrelativistic annihilation cross section can be significantly enhanced - a phenomenon known as the Sommerfeld enhancement. This enhancement exhibits resonant behavior if the long-range potential supports shallow bound states or narrow resonances, which can lead to violations of the partial-wave unitarity bound. We identify the origin of this pathological behavior as the emergence of secular terms in perturbative expansions associated with low-energy composite states of the long-range potential. To address this issue, we propose a renormalization group improvement of the perturbative series. The resulting improved amplitude provides a unitarity-consistent form of the Sommerfeld enhancement, with its poles acquiring an imaginary part that reflects the decay width of the annihilating bound states. We also briefly discuss the implications of our approach from the perspective of Wilsonian renormalization group, and comment on its potential application to higher-order annihilation processes such as bound-state formation.</description>

      <title>The Generalised Casas-Ibarra Parametrisation for Majorana Neutrino Masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and broadly applicable extension of the Casas-Ibarra parametrisation that captures the structure of all Majorana neutrino mass models. Building directly on the original formulation, our approach naturally accommodates additional degrees of freedom and provides a unified, minimal framework for parametrising the Yukawa sector. It significantly simplifies both analytical treatments and numerical scans, and can be universally applied to any Majorana neutrino mass model, regardless of the underlying dynamics. The approach also offers a unified framework for classifying neutrino mass models according to the structure of the neutrino mass matrix, which naturally motivates the proposal of an extended version of the Scotogenic Model. This classification scheme yields tree-level (loop-level) representative models: the seesaw (Scotogenic Model), the linear seesaw (the Generalised Scotogenic Model), and the linear plus inverse seesaw (the Extended Scotogenic Model). We provide ready-to-use explicit expressions for several well-known scenarios, including the Zee model where one of the Yukawa matrices is antisymmetric.</description>

Abstract: We discuss how the Bjorken sum rule allows access to the QCD running coupling $\alpha_s$ at any scale, including in the deep infrared IR domain. The Bjorken sum data from Jefferson Lab, together with the world data on $\alpha_s$ reported by the Particle Data Group, allow us to determine the running of $\alpha_s(Q)$ over five orders of magnitude in four-momentum $Q$. We present two possible future measurements of the running of $\alpha_s(Q)$ using the Bjorken sum rule: the first at the EIC, covering the range $1.5 &lt; Q &lt; 8.7$ GeV, and the second at Jefferson Lab at 22 GeV, covering the range $1.0 &lt; Q &lt; 4.7$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the nature of running couplings in the higher derivative linear and nonlinear sigma models and show that the results in dimensional regularization for the physical running couplings do not always match the values quoted in the literature. Heat kernel methods identify divergences correctly, but not all of these divergences are related to physical running couplings. Likewise the running found using the Functional Renormalization Group does not always appear as running couplings in physical processes, even for the case of logarithmic running. The basic coupling of the higher derivative SU(N) nonlinear sigma model does not run at all at one loop, in contrast to published claims for asymptotic freedom. At one loop we describe how to properly identify the physical running couplings in these theories, and provide revised numbers for the higher derivative nonlinear sigma model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological bounds on dark matter annihilation using dark ages 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M_\chi \lesssim 10^{-27}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is stronger than the bounds derived from Planck (2018) data for mass $\lesssim 10~\rm GeV$.</description>

      <title>Lattice investigation of custodial two-Higgs-doublet model at weak quartic couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which shares the same global-symmetry properties with the standard model, is studied non-perturbatively on the lattice. The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the scalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous breaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the model. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling are examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial symmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300 to 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning bare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$ bosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of the $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are explored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated lower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and independent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak transition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing properties of a smooth crossover behavior.</description>

      <title>On the reggeon model with the pomeron and odderon: singularities with non-zero masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear analysis of causality for heat flow in heavy-ion collisions: constraints from equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the causal parameter space of the Mueller-Israel-Stewart second-order theory for heat-conducting fluids in nonlinear regimes for one-dimensional fluid flow. We show that this parameter space is highly constrained and particularly sensitive to the equation of state and second-order transport coefficients. Through numerical analysis of the characteristic equations, we identify regions of strong hyperbolicity, weak hyperbolicity, and non-hyperbolicity, mapping the boundaries of causality violation as functions of the heat flux to energy density ratio $q/\varepsilon$ and relaxation parameters. We also explore the causality conditions using a realistic lattice QCD-based equation of state. Using the Navier-Stokes approximation, we estimate the heat flow magnitude to assess causality criteria for one-dimensional heat conduction in heavy-ion collisions. Our calculations reveal unrealistically large heat flux values ($|{\bf{q}}|/\varepsilon \sim 330-811$) for typical RHIC conditions when using thermal conductivity estimates from kinetic theory models, suggesting either significant overestimation of transport coefficients or breakdown of the fluid approximation in these extreme conditions. The pressure gradient corrections reduce the heat flow by approximately 15\% but do not resolve the causality concerns.</description>

      <title>Can Bose-Einstein condensates enhance radioactive decay?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation. Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that this is not the case, and the proposed experiments would have a gain of only $10^{-20}$ or smaller. We also analyze proposals for gamma ray lasers based on stimulated annihilation of positronium Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
