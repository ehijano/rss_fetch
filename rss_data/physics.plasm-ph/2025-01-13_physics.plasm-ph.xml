      <title>Formation of Anomalously Energetic Ions in Hollow Cathode Plume by Charge Separation Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollow cathodes are becoming the bottleneck of many electric propulsion systems, because of the sputtering and erosion on both cathodes and thrusters from the generation of anomalously energetic ions. So far, it is believed that energetic ions are formed by waves and instabilities always accompanied in cathode discharge, but there is no evidence yet that those proposed instabilities can lead to such high ion energies measured in experiments. In this work, a new mechanism of charge separation instability in hollow cathode plume is found via fully kinetic PIC simulations, which can easily produce energetic ions to the same level as measured in experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent full MHD coupling of JOREK and STARWALL for advanced plasma free boundary simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adequate modelling of the electromagnetic interaction of the plasma with the surrounding conductors is paramount for the correct reproduction of 3D plasma dynamics. Simulations of the latter provide in turn useful predictions regarding the plasma evolution, the related MHD modes leading to disruptions and the electromagnetic forces acting on the vacuum vessel's components when said disruptions occur. The latest modelling efforts with the 3D FEM non-linear JOREK code have been directed towards the eddy current coupling of a reduced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma model with thin and volumetric wall codes (STARWALL and CARIDDI). In this contribution, we present an eddy current coupling between the full MHD model of JOREK and the STARWALL code; this new coupling scheme describes the full three-dimensional interactions of the plasma with the vacuum region and external conductors, modeled by natural boundary conditions linking the magnetic vector potential $\mathbf{A}$ to the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. The consistency of the new coupling scheme is validated via benchmarks for axisymmetric Vertical Displacement Events and multi-harmonics simulations of MHD modes.</description>

      <title>Memory time fluctuations and instabilities in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of memory time fluctuations for instabilities in random media is considered. It is shown that fluctuations can result in infinitely fast growth of statistical moments. The effect is demonstrated in the framework of light propagation in the Universe, which contains curvature fluctuations while remaining homogeneous and isotropic on average.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of electron energy from laser wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Bayesian optimization combined with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to identify the optimal laser and plasma parameters that, for a given laser pulse energy, maximize the cut-off energy of an electron beam accelerated via laser wakefield acceleration. A Gaussian laser driver with a matched spot size and amplitude is assumed, interacting with both a uniform-density plasma and a preformed plasma channel of matched radius. To interpret the simulation results quantitatively, we derive novel analytical expressions for predicting the maximum electron energy and acceleration length, taking into account the diffraction and energy depletion of the laser pulse. Additionally, we discuss the potential scalability of the optimal parameters for high-energy lasers.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reduced modeling of streamer discharges in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for simulating filamentary electric discharges, in which channels are represented as conducting cylindrical segments. The framework requires a model that predicts the position, radius, and line conductivity of channels at a next time step. Using this information, the electric conductivity on a numerical mesh is updated, and the new electric potential is computed by solving a variable-coefficient Poisson equation. A parallel field solver with support for adaptive mesh refinement is used, and the framework provides a Python interface for easy experimentation. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to simulate positive streamer discharges in air. First, a dataset of 1000 axisymmetric positive streamer simulations is generated, in which the applied voltage and the electrode geometry are varied. Fit expressions for the streamer radius, velocity, and line conductivity are derived from this dataset, taking as input the size of the high-field region ahead of the streamers. We then construct a reduced model for positive streamers in air, which includes a stochastic branching model. The reduced model compares well with the axisymmetric simulations from the dataset, while allowing spatial and temporal step sizes that are several orders of magnitude larger. 3D simulations with the reduced model resemble experimentally observed discharge morphologies. The model runs efficiently, with 3D simulations with 20+ streamers taking 4--8 minutes on a desktop computer.</description>

      <title>Oblique photons, plasmons, and current-plasmons in relativistic plasmas and their topological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photons in vacuum are transverse in any inertial frame; longitudinal photons only exist virtually. By developing a manifestly covariant theory for electromagnetic excitations in relativistic plasmas and applying Wigner's little group method for elementary particle classifications, we show that photons in plasmas are neither transverse nor longitudinal; they are oblique. Plasmons are electromagnetic and oblique as well. The Lorentz invariant characteristics that distinguishes photons and plasmons is covariant compressibility. The manifestly covariant theory predicts the existence of the current-plasmon, a third oblique, electromagnetic eigenmode, and it also enables the study of photon topology in plasmas. Plasmas remove the photon's Dirac point in vacuum by giving it an effective mass, but create a tilted Dirac-Weyl point by reviving the virtual longitudinal photon. The manifest covariance of the theory demonstrates that relativistic transparency, despite being widely studied, does not exist in plasmas.</description>

      <title>A quasi-linear model of electromagnetic turbulent transport and its application to flux-driven transport predictions for STEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quasi-linear reduced transport model is developed from a database of high-$\beta$ electromagnetic nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations performed with Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) relevant parameters. The quasi-linear model is fully electromagnetic and accounts for the effect of equilibrium flow shear using a novel approach. Its flux predictions are shown to agree quantitatively with predictions from local nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations across a broad range of STEP-relevant local equilibria. This reduced transport model is implemented in the T3D transport solver that is used to perform the first flux-driven simulations for STEP to account for transport from hybrid-KBM turbulence, which dominates over a wide region of the core plasma. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of the final transport steady state from T3D return turbulent fluxes that are consistent with the reduced model, indicating that the quasi-linear model may also be appropriate for describing the transport steady state. Within the assumption considered here, our simulations support the existence of a transport steady state in STEP with a fusion power comparable to that in the burning flat-top of the conceptual design, but do not demonstrate how this state can be accessed.</description>

      <title>A Ritz variational principle for local collisionless gyrokinetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence driven by gyrokinetic instabilities is largely responsible for transport in magnetic fusion devices. To estimate this turbulent transport, integrated modeling codes often use mixing length estimates in conjunction with reduced models of the linearized gyrokinetic equation. One common method of formulating and solving the linearized gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem equation uses a Ritz variational principle, particularly in the local collisionless limit. However, the variational principle as typically stated in the literature is mathematically incorrect. In this work, we derive a mathematically correct form of the variational principle that applies to local linear collisionless gyrokinetics in general geometry with electromagnetic effects. We also explicitly derive a weak form of the gyrokinetic field equations suitable for numerical applications.</description>
