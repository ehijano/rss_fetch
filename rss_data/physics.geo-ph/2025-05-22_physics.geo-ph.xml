      <title>Pressure dependence of the interfacial polarization and negative activation volume for dielectric relaxation in heterogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative activation volumes for dielectric relaxation are rarely reported in solid state physics and are limited to atomic scale processes. Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy on heterogeneous systems, such as polycrystalline calcite and magnesite, hosting water in their porous spce, detectedintense dielectric relaxation mechanisms related to the interfacial polarization. The characteristic relaxation frequency increased uponhydrostatic compression, indicating that the activation volumes for relaxation are negative. However, a theoretical interpretation for the negative sign of the activation volume is lacking up to date. Within the frame of effective medium approximation for mesoscopic heterogeneous two phase solid - fluid systems, we investigate how the synergyof the pressure depedencies of polarization and electric charge transport, respectively, dictate the pressure dependence of interfacial polarization . predicting the value of the effective activation volume. Our theoretical approach succeeds in predicting the negative sign and magnitude of the activation volume in water saturated polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of thermal conductivity on the simultaneous formation of a stable region at the top of Earth's core and magnetic field generation over four billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of the emergence of a stratified region in the uppermost part of the Earth's outer core with long-term magnetic field generation is assessed, taking into account uncertainties in the thermal conductivity of the Earth's core and the present-day heat flow across the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The radial structures of the Earth's outer core are calculated for various values of thermal conductivity and CMB heat flow using a one-dimensional thermo-chemical model. The results show that there exist solutions that allow both emergence of stable stratification and long-term magnetic field generation although their thickness of stratified region is thinner than 100 km. In order to satisfy both emergence of stratified region and long-term magnetic field generation, possible value of the present-day CMB heat flow (13-15 TW) suggests a thermal conductivity of 77-121 W/m/K at CMB, which is in good agreement with the values estimated from the electrical conductivity measurements under the Earth' s core condition. The thickness of the stratified region in this case is about 50 km, which is also consistent with the thickness of the stratified region estimated from the geomagnetic secular variation. However, the proposed values of thermal conductivity obtained by this analysis could be smaller when the present-day CMB heat flow becomes smaller than the constraint used in this study.</description>

      <title>EPBench: A Benchmark for Short-term Earthquake Prediction with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, the significant advancements in artificial intelligence and neural networks have offered the potential to bring new transformations to short-term earthquake prediction research. However, currently, there is no widely used benchmark for this task. To address this, we have built a new benchmark (EPBench), which is, to our knowledge, the first global regional-scale short-term earthquake prediction benchmark. Our benchmark comprises 924,472 earthquake records and 2959 multimodal earthquake records collected from seismic networks around the world. Each record includes basic information such as time, longitude and latitude, magnitude, while each multimodal record includes waveform and moment tensor information additionally, covering a time span from 1970 to 2021. To evaluate performance of models on this task, we have established a series of data partitions and evaluation methods tailored to the short-term earthquake prediction task. We also provide a variety of tools to assist future researchers in partitioning the data according to their geographical understanding. Our benchmark includes a variety of neural network models widely used for time series forecasting, as well as a statistical-based model currently employed by seismological bureaus in several countries. We hope this benchmark will serve as a guide to attract more researchers to explore new methods for addressing this task, which holds great significance for human existence.</description>

      <title>Ultralow loss torsion micropendula for chipscale gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a new class of chipscale torsion pendula formed by Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbon suspensions. Owing to their unique hierarchy of gravitational, tensile, and elastic stiffness, the devices exhibit damping rates of $\sim 10\;\mu$Hz and parametric gravity sensitivities near that of an ideal pendulum. The suspension nonlinearity can also be used to cancel the pendulum nonlinearity, paving the way towards fully isochronous, high $Q$ pendulum gravimeters. As a demonstration, we study a 0.1 mg, 32 Hz micropendulum with a damping rate of $16\;\mu$Hz, a thermal acceleration sensitivity of $2\;\text{n}g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, and a parametric gravity sensitivity of $5$ Hz/$g_0$. We record Allan deviations as low as 2.5 $\mu$Hz at 100 seconds, corresponding to a bias stability of $5\times 10^{-7}g_0$. We also demonstrate a 100-fold cancellation of the pendulum nonlinearity. In addition to inertial sensing, our devices are well suited to proposed searches for new physics exploiting low-loss micro- to milligram-scale mechanical oscillators.</description>
