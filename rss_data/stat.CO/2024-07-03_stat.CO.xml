      <title>Scalable expectation propagation for generalized linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized linear models (GLMs) arguably represent the standard approach for statistical regression beyond the Gaussian likelihood scenario. When Bayesian formulations are employed, the general absence of a tractable posterior distribution has motivated the development of deterministic approximations, which are generally more scalable than sampling techniques. Among them, expectation propagation (EP) showed extreme accuracy, usually higher than many variational Bayes solutions. However, the higher computational cost of EP posed concerns about its practical feasibility, especially in high-dimensional settings. We address these concerns by deriving a novel efficient formulation of EP for GLMs, whose cost scales linearly in the number of covariates p. This reduces the state-of-the-art O(p^2 n) per-iteration computational cost of the EP routine for GLMs to O(p n min{p,n}), with n being the sample size. We also show that, for binary models and log-linear GLMs approximate predictive means can be obtained at no additional cost. To preserve efficient moment matching for count data, we propose employing a combination of log-normal Laplace transform approximations, avoiding numerical integration. These novel results open the possibility of employing EP in settings that were believed to be practically impossible. Improvements over state-of-the-art approaches are illustrated both for simulated and real data. The efficient EP implementation is available at https://github.com/niccoloanceschi/EPglm.</description>

      <title>A Cepstral Model for Efficient Spectral Analysis of Covariate-dependent Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel and computationally fast model to study the association between covariates and power spectra of replicated time series. A random covariate-dependent Cram\'{e}r spectral representation and a semiparametric log-spectral model are used to quantify the association between the log-spectra and covariates. Each replicate-specific log-spectrum is represented by the cepstrum, inducing a cepstral-based multivariate linear model with the cepstral coefficients as the responses. By using only a small number of cepstral coefficients, the model parsimoniously captures frequency patterns of time series and saves a significant amount of computational time compared to existing methods. A two-stage estimation procedure is proposed. In the first stage, a Whittle likelihood-based approach is used to estimate the truncated replicate-specific cepstral coefficients. In the second stage, parameters of the cepstral-based multivariate linear model, and consequently the effect functions of covariates, are estimated. The model is flexible in the sense that it can accommodate various estimation methods for the multivariate linear model, depending on the application, domain knowledge, or characteristics of the covariates. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed method outperforms some existing methods despite its simplicity and shorter computational time. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</description>

      <title>Forecast Linear Augmented Projection (FLAP): A free lunch to reduce forecast error variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel forecast linear augmented projection (FLAP) method is introduced, which reduces the forecast error variance of any unbiased multivariate forecast without introducing bias. The method first constructs new component series which are linear combinations of the original series. Forecasts are then generated for both the original and component series. Finally, the full vector of forecasts is projected onto a linear subspace where the constraints implied by the combination weights hold. It is proven that the trace of the forecast error variance is non-increasing with the number of components, and mild conditions are established for which it is strictly decreasing. It is also shown that the proposed method achieves maximum forecast error variance reduction among linear projection methods. The theoretical results are validated through simulations and two empirical applications based on Australian tourism and FRED-MD data. Notably, using FLAP with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct the new series leads to substantial forecast error variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Regularized estimation of Monge-Kantorovich quantiles for spherical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tools from optimal transport (OT) theory have recently been used to define a notion of quantile function for directional data. In practice, regularization is mandatory for applications that require out-of-sample estimates. To this end, we introduce a regularized estimator built from entropic optimal transport, by extending the definition of the entropic map to the spherical setting. We propose a stochastic algorithm to directly solve a continuous OT problem between the uniform distribution and a target distribution, by expanding Kantorovich potentials in the basis of spherical harmonics. In addition, we define the directional Monge-Kantorovich depth, a companion concept for OT-based quantiles. We show that it benefits from desirable properties related to Liu-Zuo-Serfling axioms for the statistical analysis of directional data. Building on our regularized estimators, we illustrate the benefits of our methodology for data analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of large-scale nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems under model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) under model uncertainty. Specifically, we consider inverse problems in which, in addition to the inversion parameters, the governing PDEs include secondary uncertain parameters. We focus on problems with infinite-dimensional inversion and secondary parameters and present a scalable computational framework for optimal design of such problems. The proposed approach enables Bayesian inversion and OED under uncertainty within a unified framework. We build on the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach, to incorporate modeling uncertainties in the Bayesian inverse problem, and methods for A-optimal design of infinite-dimensional Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems. Specifically, a Gaussian approximation to the posterior at the maximum a posteriori probability point is used to define an uncertainty aware OED objective that is tractable to evaluate and optimize. In particular, the OED objective can be computed at a cost, in the number of PDE solves, that does not grow with the dimension of the discretized inversion and secondary parameters. The OED problem is formulated as a binary bilevel PDE constrained optimization problem and a greedy algorithm, which provides a pragmatic approach, is used to find optimal designs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for a model inverse problem governed by an elliptic PDE on a three-dimensional domain. Our computational results also highlight the pitfalls of ignoring modeling uncertainties in the OED and/or inference stages.</description>

      <title>Large Skew-t Copula Models and Asymmetric Dependence in Intraday Equity Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skew-t copula models are attractive for the modeling of financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence. We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and Capitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A stochastic gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The methodology is used to estimate skew-t factor copula models with up to 15 factors for intraday returns from 2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in pairwise correlations. In a moving window study we show that the asymmetric dependencies also vary over time, and that intraday predictive densities from the skew-t copula are more accurate than those from benchmark copula models. Portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise asymmetric dependencies improve performance relative to the index.</description>

      <title>CausalMetaR: An R package for performing causally interpretable meta-analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers would often like to leverage data from a collection of sources (e.g., primary studies in a meta-analysis) to estimate causal effects in a target population of interest. However, traditional meta-analytic methods do not produce causally interpretable estimates for a well-defined target population. In this paper, we present the CausalMetaR R package, which implements efficient and robust methods to estimate causal effects in a given internal or external target population using multi-source data. The package includes estimators of average and subgroup treatment effects for the entire target population. To produce efficient and robust estimates of causal effects, the package implements doubly robust and non-parametric efficient estimators and supports using flexible data-adaptive (e.g., machine learning techniques) methods and cross-fitting techniques to estimate the nuisance models (e.g., the treatment model, the outcome model). We describe the key features of the package and demonstrate how to use the package through an example.</description>
