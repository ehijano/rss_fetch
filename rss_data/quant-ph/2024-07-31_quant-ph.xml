      <title>Hybrid Heuristic Algorithms for Adiabatic Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent developments of adiabatic quantum machine learning (AQML) methods and applications based on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model have received attention from academics and practitioners. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines, balanced k-means clustering, linear regression, Decision Tree Splitting, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and Deep Belief Networks can be transformed into a QUBO model. The training of adiabatic quantum machine learning models is the bottleneck for computation. Heuristics-based quantum annealing solvers such as Simulated Annealing and Multiple Start Tabu Search (MSTS) are implemented to speed up the training of AQML based on the QUBO model. The main purpose of this paper is to present a hybrid heuristic embedding an r-flip strategy to solve large-scale QUBO with an improved solution and shorter computing time compared to the state-of-the-art MSTS method. The results of the substantial computational experiments are reported to compare an r-flip strategy embedded hybrid heuristic and a multiple start tabu search algorithm on a set of benchmark instances and three large-scale QUBO instances. The r-flip strategy embedded algorithm provides very high-quality solutions within the CPU time limits of 60 and 600 seconds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation via Stochastic Combination of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation algorithms often require numerous ancilla qubits and deep circuits, prohibitive for near-term hardware. We introduce a framework for simulating quantum channels using ensembles of low-depth circuits in place of many-qubit dilations. This naturally enables simulations of open systems, which we demonstrate by preparing damped many-qubit GHZ states on ibm_hanoi. The technique further inspires two Hamiltonian simulation algorithms with asymptotic independence of the spectral precision, reducing resource requirements by several orders of magnitude for a benchmark system.</description>

      <title>Charge and Flux Noise from Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Energy Distributions in Superconducting Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasiparticle density observed in low-temperature superconducting circuits is several orders of magnitude higher than the value expected at thermal equilibrium. The tunneling of this excess of quasiparticles across Josephson junctions is recognized as one of the main loss and decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Here we propose an additional loss mechanism arising from nonequilibrium quasiparticle densities: Ohmic loss due to quasiparticles residing in superconducting wires away from the junctions. Our theory leverages the recent experimental demonstration that the excess quasiparticles are in quasiequilibrium [T. Connolly et al., $\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.217001}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 132}, 217001 (2024)}$] and uses a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to predict the amount of charge and flux noise generated by them. We show that the resulting charge noise can be larger than dielectric loss due to amorphous two-level systems at frequencies in the MHz range, and find a logarithmic-in-frequency ``nearly white" contribution to flux noise that is comparable to the flux noise observed in experiments. This shows that wire-resident quasiparticles are a universal source of loss and decoherence even when the quasiparticles are far away from Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage from measurement-induced entanglement in random shallow circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random constant-depth quantum circuits in a two-dimensional architecture. While these circuits only produce entanglement between nearby qubits on the lattice, long-range entanglement can be generated by measuring a subset of the qubits of the output state. It is conjectured that this long-range measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) proliferates when the circuit depth is at least a constant critical value. For circuits composed of Haar-random two-qubit gates, it is also believed that this coincides with a quantum advantage phase transition in the classical hardness of sampling from the output distribution. Here we provide evidence for a quantum advantage phase transition in the setting of random Clifford circuits. Our work extends the scope of recent separations between the computational power of constant-depth quantum and classical circuits, demonstrating that this kind of advantage is present in canonical random circuit sampling tasks. In particular, we show that in any architecture of random shallow Clifford circuits, the presence of long-range MIE gives rise to an unconditional quantum advantage. In contrast, any depth-d 2D quantum circuit that satisfies a short-range MIE property can be classically simulated efficiently and with depth O(d). Finally, we introduce a two-dimensional, depth-2, "coarse-grained" circuit architecture, composed of random Clifford gates acting on O(log n) qubits, for which we prove the existence of long-range MIE and establish an unconditional quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>AI methods for approximate compiling of unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the approximate compiling of unitaries, focusing on the use of fixed two-qubit gates and arbitrary single-qubit rotations typical in superconducting hardware. Our approach involves three main stages: identifying an initial template that approximates the target unitary, predicting initial parameters for this template, and refining these parameters to maximize the fidelity of the circuit. We propose AI-driven approaches for the first two stages, with a deep learning model that suggests initial templates and an autoencoder-like model that suggests parameter values, which are refined through gradient descent to achieve the desired fidelity. We demonstrate the method on 2 and 3-qubit unitaries, showcasing promising improvements over exhaustive search and random parameter initialization. The results highlight the potential of AI to enhance the transpiling process, supporting more efficient quantum computations on current and future quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A framework for semi-universality: Semi-universality of 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits with symmetry-respecting gates have attracted broad interest in quantum information science. While recent work has developed a theory for circuits with Abelian symmetries, revealing important distinctions between Abelian and non-Abelian cases, a comprehensive framework for non-Abelian symmetries has been lacking. In this work, we develop novel techniques and a powerful framework that is particularly useful for understanding circuits with non-Abelian symmetries. Using this framework we settle an open question on quantum circuits with SU(d) symmetry. We show that 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are semi-universal, i.e., generate all SU(d)-invariant unitaries, up to certain constraints on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent representation of symmetry. Furthermore, we prove that these gates achieve full universality when supplemented with 3 ancilla qudits. Interestingly, we find that studying circuits with 3-qudit gates is also useful for a better understanding of circuits with 2-qudit gates. In particular, we establish that even though 2-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are not themselves semi-universal, they become universal with at most 11 ancilla qudits. Additionally, we investigate the statistical properties of circuits composed of random SU(d)-invariant gates. Our findings reveal that while circuits with 2-qudit gates do not form a 2-design for the Haar measure over SU(d)-invariant unitaries, circuits with 3-qudit gates generate a t-design, with t that is quadratic in the number of qudits.</description>

      <title>Universal Euler-Cartan Circuits for Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently solve problems which are widely believed to lie beyond the reach of classical computers. In the near-term, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which efficiently embed quantum hardware in classical frameworks, are crucial in bridging the vast divide in the performance of the purely-quantum algorithms and their classical counterparts. Here, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is presented for the computation of non-perturbative characteristics of quantum field theories. The presented algorithm relies on a universal parametrized quantum circuit ansatz based on Euler and Cartan's decompositions of single and two-qubit operators. It is benchmarked by computing the energy spectra of lattice realizations of quantum field theories with both short and long range interactions. Low depth circuits are provided for false vacua as well as highly excited states corresponding to mesonic and baryonic excitations occurring in the analyzed models. The described algorithm opens a hitherto-unexplored avenue for the investigation of mass-ratios, scattering amplitudes and false-vacuum decays in quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is a critical technique that enables numerous quantum applications. Most fiber-based long-distance experiments reported to date have utilized photon pair sources generated in bulk optical crystals, with the entanglement encoded in the polarization degree of freedom. Here, we create time-energy entanglement for photon pairs generated from an on-chip silicon ring resonator via SFWM process and report the distribution of the entanglement over standard optical fiber with distance &gt;81 km. Our work paves the way for future large-scale quantum networks with connect of distant quantum nodes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Purpose Architecture for Fast Reset and Protective Readout of Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to fast reset a qubit state is crucial for quantum information processing. However, to actively reset a qubit requires engineering a pathway to interact with a dissipative bath, which often comes with the cost of reduced qubit protection from the environment. Here, we present a novel multi-purpose architecture that enables fast reset and protection of superconducting qubits during control and readout. In our design, two on-chip diplexers are connected by two transmission lines. The high-pass branch provides a flat passband for convenient allocation of readout resonators above the qubit frequencies, which is preferred for reducing measurement-induced state transitions. In the low-pass branch, we leverage a standing-wave mode below the maximum qubit frequency for a rapid reset. The qubits are located in the common stopband to inhibit dissipation during coherent operations. We demonstrate resetting a transmon qubit from its first excited state to the ground state in 100 ns, achieving a residual population of 2.7%, mostly limited by the thermal effect. The reset time may be further shortened to 27 ns by exploiting the coherent population inversion effect. We further extend the technique to resetting the qubit from its second excited state. Our approach promises scalable implementation of fast reset and qubit protection during control and readout, adding to the toolbox of dissipation engineering.</description>

      <title>In situ Qubit Frequency Tuning Circuit for Scalable Superconducting Quantum Computing: Scheme and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency tunable qubit plays a significant role for scalable superconducting quantum processors. The state-of-the-art room-temperature electronics for tuning qubit frequency suffers from unscalable limit, such as heating problem, linear growth of control cables, etc. Here we propose a scalable scheme to tune the qubit frequency by using in situ superconducting circuit, which is based on radio frequency superconducting quantum interference device (rf-SQUID). We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the qubit frequency could be modulated by inputting several single pulses into rf-SQUID. Compared with the traditional scheme, our scheme not only solves the heating problem, but also provides the potential to exponentially reduce the number of cables inside the dilute refrigerator and the room-temperature electronics resource for tuning qubit frequency, which is achieved by a time-division-multiplex (TDM) scheme combining rf-SQUID with switch arrays. With such TDM scheme, the number of cables could be reduced from the usual $\sim 3n$ to $\sim \log_2{(3n)} + 1$ for two-dimensional quantum processors comprising $n$ qubits and $\sim 2n$ couplers. Our work paves the way for large-scale control of superconducting quantum processor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dicke states form a class of entangled states that has attracted much attention for their applications in various quantum algorithms. They emerge as eigenstates of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, a simplification of the Dicke model, which describes an assembly of two-level atoms trapped in an electromagnetic cavity. In this letter, we show that in the regime where the field energy is large with respect to the atomic energy splitting, precise control of the ground state can be implemented. Specifically, pure Dicke states can be selected and produced by appropriate tuning of the parameters. This result may have important applications in quantum engineering and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>On the use of calibration data in error-aware compilation techniques for NISQ devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliably executing quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is challenging, as they are severely constrained and prone to errors. Efficient quantum circuit compilation techniques are therefore crucial for overcoming their limitations and dealing with their high error rates. These techniques consider the quantum hardware restrictions, such as the limited qubit connectivity, and perform some transformations to the original circuit that can be executed on a given quantum processor. Certain compilation methods use error information based on calibration data to further improve the success probability or the fidelity of the circuit to be run. However, it is uncertain to what extent incorporating calibration information in the compilation process can enhance the circuit performance. For instance, considering the most recent error data provided by vendors after calibrating the processor might not be functional enough as quantum systems are subject to drift, making the latest calibration data obsolete within minutes. In this paper, we explore how different usage of calibration data impacts the circuit fidelity, by using several compilation techniques and quantum processors (IBM Perth and Brisbane). To this aim, we implemented a framework that incorporates some of the state-of-the-art noise-aware and non-noise-aware compilation techniques and allows the user to perform fair comparisons under similar processor conditions. Our experiments yield valuable insights into the effects of noise-aware methodologies and the employment of calibration data. The main finding is that pre-processing historical calibration data can improve fidelity when real-time calibration data is not available due to factors such as cloud service latency and waiting queues between compilation and execution on the quantum backend.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum strategies with small input cardinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect strategy is one that allows the mutually in-communicated players of a nonlocal game to win every trial of the game. Perfect strategies are basic tools for some fundamental results in quantum computation and crucial resources for some applications in quantum information. Here, we address the problem of producing qudit-qudit perfect quantum strategies with a small number of settings. For that, we exploit a recent result showing that any perfect quantum strategy induces a Kochen-Specker set. We identify a family of KS sets in even dimension $d \ge 6$ that, for many dimensions, require the smallest number of orthogonal bases known: $d+1$. This family was only defined for some $d$. We first extend the family to infinitely many more dimensions. Then, we show the optimal way to use each of these sets to produce a bipartite perfect strategy with minimum input cardinality. As a result, we present a family of perfect quantum strategies in any $(2,d-1,d)$ Bell scenario, with $d = 2^kp^m$ for $p$ prime, $m \geq k \geq 0$ (excluding $m=k=0$), $d = 8p$ for $p \geq 19$, $d=kp$ for $p &gt; ((k-2)2^{k-2})^2$ whenever there exists a Hadamard matrix of order $k$, other sporadic examples, as well as a recursive construction that produces perfect quantum strategies for infinitely many dimensions $d$ from any dimension $d'$ with a perfect quantum strategy. We identify their associated Bell inequalities and prove that they are not tight, which provides a second counterexample to a conjecture of 2007.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature efficient single-photon generation from CdSe/ZnS nanoplateletes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for materials for quantum information science applications, colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) have emerged as a highly promising new class of materials due to their interesting optical properties, such as narrow emission linewidth and fast photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes at room temperature. So far only few works focused on the quantum properties of their emission, however, NPLs, with their atomic-scale thickness and one-dimensional quantum confinement, are promising candidates for single-photon sources. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature single-photon emission from core/shell CdSe/ZnS NPLs, which feature 8$x$20 nm$^2$ surface area and 1 nm shell. The limited surface area ensures effective Auger non-radiative recombination, resulting in highly efficient single-photon generation with values of photon purity as low as $g^{(2)}(\tau)=0.04$. The observed long-period blinking and bleaching, typical of such thin shells, can be easily reduced by increasing the shell thickness. This work establishes NPLs as new single-photon sources very well suited for integration into quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of open quantum systems through the Hamiltonian of Mean Force, focusing on two models: a two-qubit system interacting with a thermal bath and a Jaynes-Cummings Model without the rotating wave approximation. By analyzing both weak and strong coupling regimes, we uncover the impact of environmental interactions on quantum thermodynamic quantities, including specific heat capacity, internal energy, and entropy. Further, the ergotropy and entropy production are computed. We also explore the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which sets an upper bound on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a quantum thermometer based on a multi-layered collisional model. The proposed architecture provides significant sensitivity even for short interaction times between the ancillae comprised in the thermometer and the system to be probed, and a small number of information-acquiring collisions. The assessment of the flow of information taking place within the layered thermometer and between system and thermometer reveals that the tuning of the mutual backflow of information has a positive influence on the precision of thermometry, and helps unveiling the information-theoretic mechanisms behind the working principles of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended XY model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor XY model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Magnetic Flux in Rydberg Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for generating homogeneous and tunable magnetic flux for bosonic particles in a lattice using Rydberg atoms. Our setup relies on Rydberg excitations hopping through the lattice by dipolar exchange interactions. The magnetic flux arises from complex hopping via ancilla atoms. Remarkably, the total flux within a magnetic unit cell directly depends on the ratio of the number of lattice sites to ancilla atoms, making it topologically protected to small changes in the positions of the atoms. This allows us to optimize the positions of the ancilla atoms to make the flux through the magnetic unit cell homogeneous. With this homogeneous flux, we get a topological flat band in the single-particle regime. In the many-body regime, we obtain indications of a bosonic fractional Chern insulator state at $\nu = 1/2$ filling.</description>

      <title>Twirled worlds: symmetry-induced failures of tomographic locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic locality is a principle commonly used in the program of finding axioms that pick out quantum theory within the landscape of possible theories. The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory -- which can be classical, quantum or post-quantum -- and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds. We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic nonlocality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.</description>

      <title>Experimentally probing Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a Klein-Gordon to a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid model and analyse the information-theoretic contributions to Landauer's principle for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results agree with theoretical predictions, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the potential of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Private and Robust States for Distributed Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing enables the estimation of multiple parameters encoded in spatially separated probes. While traditional quantum sensing is often focused on estimating a single parameter with maximum precision, distributed quantum sensing seeks to estimate some function of multiple parameters that are only locally accessible for each party involved. In such settings it is natural to not want to give away more information than is necessary. To address this, we use the concept of privacy with respect to a function, ensuring that only information about the target function is available to all the parties, and no other information. We define a measure of privacy (essentially how close we are to this condition being satisfied), and show it satisfies a set of naturally desirable properties of such a measure. Using this privacy measure, we identify and construct entangled resources states that ensure privacy for a given function under different resource distributions and encoding dynamics, characterized by Hamiltonian evolution. For separable and parallel Hamiltonians, we prove that the GHZ state is the only private state for certain linear functions, with the minimum amount of required resources, up to SLOCC. Recognizing the vulnerability of this state to particle loss, we create families of private states, that remain robust even against loss of qubits, by incorporating additional resources. We then extend our findings to different resource distribution scenarios and Hamiltonians, resulting in a comprehensive set of private and robust states for distributed quantum estimation. These results advance the understanding of privacy and robustness in multi-parameter quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Decisions via Quantum Telepathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum telepathy, or pseudotelepathy, is the phenomenon where two non-communicating parties can exhibit correlated behaviors that are impossible to achieve using classical mechanics. This is also known as Bell inequality violation and is made possible by quantum entanglement. In this work, we present a conceptual framework for applying quantum telepathy to real-world problems. In general, the problems involve coordinating decisions given a set of observations without being able to communicate. We argue this inability is actually quite prevalent in the modern era where the decision-making timescales of computer processors are so short that speed of light delay is actually quite appreciable in comparison. We highlight the example of high-frequency trading (HFT), where trades are made at microsecond timescales, but the speed of light delay between different exchanges can range from the order of 10 microseconds to 10 milliseconds. Due to the maturity of Bell inequality violation experiments, experimental realization of quantum telepathy schemes that can attain a quantum advantage for real-world problems $\textit{is already almost immediately possible}$. We demonstrate this by conducting a case study for a concrete HFT scenario that gives rise to a generalization of the CHSH game and evaluate different possible physical implementations for achieving a quantum advantage. It is well known that Bell inequality violation is a rigorous mathematical proof of a quantum advantage over any classical strategy and does not need any complexity-theoretic assumptions such as $\text{BQP}\neq\text{BPP}$. Moreover, fault tolerance is not necessary to realize a quantum advantage: for example, violating the CHSH inequality only requires single-qubit gates applied on two entangled qubits.</description>

      <title>Linking quantum discord with Bayesian game theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Witnessing quantum correlation in real, practical experimental set-ups is a key focus for the development of near-future quantum technologies. Whilst there are several experimental protocols for witnessing entanglement, detecting quantum discord remains far more elusive. A recently proposed quantum discord witness offers an experimentally accessible set-up which allows the quantum discord to be witnessed through a non-linear combination of correlation functions. Interestingly, the experimental set-up can be mapped to Bayesian game theory allowing for an extended generalisation of the proposed witness. Subsequently, it is shown that there is a direct link between the expected payoff in Bayesian game theory and the previously proposed quantum discord witness by uniting these two concepts through the established CHSH game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum computers needs reliable quantum hardware and tailored software for controlling electronics specific to various quantum platforms. Middleware is a type of computer software program that aims to provide standardized software tools across the entire pipeline, from high level execution of quantum computing algorithms to low level driver instructions tailored to specific experimental setups, including instruments. This paper presents updates to Qibolab, a software library that leverages Qibo capabilities to execute quantum algorithms on self hosted quantum hardware platforms. Qibolab offers an application programming interface (API) for instrument control through arbitrary pulses and driver operations including sweepers. This paper offers an overview of the new features implemented in Qibolab, including the redefined boundaries between platform and channel classes, the integration of an emulator for simulating quantum hardware behaviour, and it shows updated execution times benchmarks for superconducting single qubit calibration routines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An entanglement purification protocol (EPP) aims to transform multiple noisy entangled states into a single entangled state with higher fidelity. In this work we consider EPPs that always yield an output fidelity no worse than each of the original noisy states, a property we call universality. We prove there is no $n$-to-1 EPP implementable by local operations and classical communication that is universal for all two-qubit entangled states, whereas such an EPP is possible using more general positive partial transpose-preserving (PPT) operations. We also show that universality is not possible by bilocal Clifford EPPs even when restricted to states with fidelities above an arbitrarily high threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fibonacci topological order is the prime candidate for the realization of universal topological quantum computation. We devise minimal quantum circuits to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, as realized in the Levin-Wen string net model. Our circuits effectively initialize the ground state, create excitations, twist and braid them, all in the smallest lattices possible. We further design methods to determine the fusion amplitudes and braiding phases of multiple excitations by carrying out a single qubit measurement. We show that the fusion channels of the doubled Fibonacci model can be detected using only three qubits, twisting phases can be measured using five, and braiding can be demonstrated using nine qubits. These designs provide the simplest possible settings for demonstrating the properties of Fibonacci anyons and can be used as realistic blueprints for implementation on many modern quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A photonic system with a tunable bath environment provides an extra degree of freedom for quantum simulators. Such a system can be realized by parametrically modulating the coupling between the system and bath. In this letter, by coupling a transmon qubit to a lossy Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) mode, we experimentally create a tunable chemical potential for the qubit mode. We show that the qubit can be thermalized to equilibrium with different population distributions under different parametric pumping conditions. We further extend our method to the third level of the transmon, showing its practical use beyond the simple two-level case. Our results provide a useful tool that can be readily integrated with quantum simulators that would benefit from a non-trivial photon population distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present shadow Hamiltonian simulation, a framework for simulating quantum dynamics using a compressed quantum state that we call the "shadow state". The amplitudes of this shadow state are proportional to the expectations of a set of operators of interest. The shadow state evolves according to its own Schr\"odinger equation, and under broad conditions can be simulated on a quantum computer. We analyze a number of applications of this framework to quantum simulation problems. This includes simulating the dynamics of exponentially large systems of free fermions, or exponentially large systems of free bosons, the latter example recovering a recent algorithm for simulating exponentially many classical harmonic oscillators. Shadow Hamiltonian simulation can be extended to simulate expectations of more complex operators such as two-time correlators or Green's functions, and to study the evolution of operators themselves in the Heisenberg picture.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov-state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the complexity compared to that obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises two subspaces with a weak coupling between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are a class of quantum many-body states that generalize Matrix Product States for one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions. In recent years, PEPS have advanced understanding of strongly correlated systems, especially in two dimensions, e.g., quantum spin liquids. Typically described by tensor networks on regular lattices (e.g., square, cubic), PEPS have also been adapted for irregular graphs, however, the computational cost becomes prohibitive for dense graphs with large vertex degrees. In this paper, we present a PEPS algorithm to simulate low-energy states and dynamics defined on arbitrary, fluctuating, and densely connected graphs. We introduce a cut-off, $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$, to constrain the vertex degree of the PEPS to a set but tunable value, which is enforced in the optimization by applying a simple edge-deletion rule, allowing the geometry of the PEPS to change and adapt dynamically to the system's correlation structure. We benchmark our flexible PEPS algorithm with simulations of classical spin glasses and quantum annealing on densely connected graphs with hundreds of spins, and also study the impact of tuning $\kappa$ when simulating a uniform quantum spin model on a regular (square) lattice. Our work opens the way to apply tensor network algorithms to arbitrary, even fluctuating, background geometries.</description>

      <title>Entropy production due to spacetime fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum nature of the gravitational field is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges in theoretical physics. Despite significant progress, a complete and consistent theory remains elusive. However, in the weak field approximation -- where curvature effects are small -- we can explore some expected properties of such a theory. Particularly relevant to this study is the quantum nature of gravitational waves, which are represented as small perturbations in flat spacetime. In this framework, a quantum description of these perturbations, as a quantum field, is feasible, leading to the emergence of the graviton. Here we consider a non-relativistic quantum system interacting with such a field. We employ the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics, which allows us to frame classical questions in a quantum context, to define a fluctuation relation for this system. As a result, thermodynamic entropy must be produced in the system due to its unavoidable interaction with the quantum fluctuations of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We present the first principles construction of the low-energy effective action for bosonic self-organized quantum quasicrystals. Our generalized elasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding conjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the Goldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we obtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic speed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between phononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the latter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a longitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound. Finally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high density phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.</description>

      <title>The impact of quantum noise on limit cycles and entrainment in an atom-cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise is inherent in any open quantum system as it affects not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. A transversely pumped atom-cavity setup is a prototypical example of such an open system, wherein limit cycles (LCs) have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals (CTCs). Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced enhancement of temporal ordering. By comparing the oscillation frequencies of the LCs for the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) regimes, we find that the LC frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D than in 2D. We demonstrate that this has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Advanced Techniques for High-Performance Fock Matrix Construction on GPU Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Article presents two optimized multi-GPU algorithms for Fock matrix construction, building on the work of Ufimtsev et al. and Barca et al. The novel algorithms, opt-UM and opt-Brc, introduce significant enhancements, including improved integral screening, exploitation of sparsity and symmetry, a linear scaling exchange matrix assembly algorithm, and extended capabilities for Hartree-Fock caculations up to $f$-type angular momentum functions. Opt-Brc excels for smaller systems and for highly contracted triple-$\zeta$ basis sets, while opt-UM is advantageous for large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs show that our algorithms in the EXtreme-scale Electronic Structure System (EXESS), when combined, outperform all current GPU and CPU Fock build implementations in TeraChem, QUICK, GPU4PySCF, LibIntX, ORCA, and Q-Chem. The implementations were benchmarked on linear and globular systems and average speed ups across three double-$\zeta$ basis sets of 1.5$\times$, 5.2$\times$, and 8.5$\times$ were observed compared to TeraChem, GPU4PySCF, and QUICK respectively. Strong scaling analysis reveals over 91% parallel efficiency on four GPUs for opt-Brc, making it typically faster for multi-GPU execution. Single-compute-node comparisons with CPU-based software like ORCA and Q-Chem show speedups of up to 42$\times$ and 31$\times$, respectively, enhancing power efficiency by up to 18$\times$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattices in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating crystal bilayers twisted with respect to each other would lead to large periodic supercell structures, which can support a wide range of novel electron correlated phenomena, where the full understanding is still under debate. Here, we propose a new scheme to realize a nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattice in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The key idea here is to utilize the nonlinear effect from the intrinsic atomic interactions to couple different layers and induce a dynamical self-organized supercell structure, dramatically distinct from the conventional wisdom to achieve the static twisted-bilayer lattices. To illustrate that, we study the dynamics of a two-component BEC and show that the nonlinear interaction effect naturally emerged in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of interacting bosonic ultracold atoms can dynamically induce both periodic (commensurable) and aperiodic (incommensurable) moir\'{e} structures. One of the interesting moir\'{e} phenomena, i.e., the flat-band physics, is shown through investigating the dynamics of the wave packet of BEC. Our proposal can be implemented using available state-of-the-art experimental techniques and reveal a profound connection between the nonlinearity and twistronics in cold atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>All-electrical operation of a spin qubit coupled to a high-Q resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a practical quantum processor involves integrating millions of physical qubits along with the necessary components for individual qubit manipulation and readout. Arrays of gated silicon spins offer a promising route toward achieving this goal. Optimized radio frequency resonators with high internal quality factor are based on superconducting inductors and enable fast spin readout. All-electrical spin control and gate-dispersive readout remove the need for additional device components and simplify scaling. However, superconducting high-Q tank circuits are susceptible to crosstalk induced ringup from electrical qubit control pulses, which causes fluctuations of the quantum dot potential and is suspected to degrade qubit performance. Here, we report on the coherent and all-electrical control of a hole spin qubit at 1.5K, integrated into a silicon fin field-effect transistor and connected to a niobium nitride nanowire inductor gate-sensor. Our experiments show that qubit control pulses with their broad range of higher harmonics ring up the tank when the control pulse spectrum overlaps with the tank resonance. This can cause a reduction of the readout visibility if the tank ringing amplitude exceeds the excited state splitting of the quantum dot, lifting Pauli spin blockade and thus leading to state preparation and measurement errors. We demonstrate how to circumvent these effects by engineering control pulses around the tank resonances. Importantly, we find that the ringup does not limit the spin coherence time, indicating that efficient high-Q resonators in gate-sensing are compatible with all-electrical spin control.</description>

      <title>Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Quantum Annealing for Active User Detection in a NOMA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active user detection in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network is a major challenge for 5G/6G applications. However, classical algorithms that can perform this task suffer either from complexity or reduced performances. This work aims at proposing a quantum annealing approach to overcome this trade-off. Firstly, we show that the maximum a posteriori decoder of the activity pattern of the network can be seen as the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. For N users in a network with perfect channels, we propose a universal control function to schedule the annealing process. Our approach avoids to continuously compute the optimal control function but still ensures high success probability while demanding a lower annealing time than a linear control function. This advantage holds even in the presence of imperfections in the network.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are extremely sensitive magnetic flux sensors which render them useful in a wide array of instrumentation. SQUIDs are often paired with other detectors as a readout mechanism to obtain quantitative insight. SQUIDs have impacted many fields but much less addressed is its impact on the field of fundamental physics, particularly in the search for dark matter. Dark matter is believed to make up around 27% of all mass-energy content of the universe and will provide critical insight into understanding large-scale structures of the universe. Axions and WIMPs are the prominent two dark matter candidates whose search has been fueled by the usage of SQUID read-outs.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A static electric field of a few V/cm shifts the energy levels of ultracold Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. For a given principle quantum number, most of the energy levels are nearly degenerate at zero field and fan out with increasing field to form a manifold. We excite Rydberg atoms to energy levels near the center of the manifold, where the spacing is nearly harmonic, and allow them to exchange energy via resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We measure the time evolution as energy spreads away from the center of the manifold, which reveals that the system fails to thermalize for long interaction times. A computational model that includes only a few essential features of the system qualitatively agrees with this result.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of charged dual-unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of quantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss their non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet interacting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the more analytically tractable "charged moments", i.e. traces of powers of a suitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms of a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local algebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments, valid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the relevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially with the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Introduction Of Quantum Entanglement Measure Based On The Expectation Values Of Pauli Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, firstly considering that in separable states, the measurement of one particle has no effect on the measurement of the second particle, we show that Alice and Bob can find directions in which the results of their measurements on the spin of the particle are always maximized. In other words, the state of the particle is an eigenstate for the operator that is applied in that direction, so the sum of the spins of two particles can have a maximum value. We will argue that in entangled states, due to the effect of particle measurement results on each other, Alice and Bob cannot find the desired operators. Therefore, in such measurements, the total spin of the particles will always be less than the mentioned maximum. But we ask them to try and measure in directions that will get the most value. Because this value is maximum for separable states and minimum for fully entangled states, and for the rest of the states, it will be proportional to the degree of entanglement between the two maximum and minimum values, we set this parameter as We are calling it the "separability index". Then, based on this index, the measure of entanglement was introduced and extended to states with higher dimensions. In the end, examples of di-qubit states di-qutrit states, and di-qudit states were investigated and the efficiency of the measure was confirmed by the results of the examples. Considering that in this measure, the values of entanglement are calculated based on the expectation values and we can measure the expectation values in the experiment, we hope to be one step closer to the testability of the entanglement value.</description>

      <title>One-time Pad Encryption Model for Non-local Correlations</title>

Abstract: We present a cryptographic-inspired framework for modeling Bell nonlocal correlations. Drawing inspiration from the renowned De Broglie-Bohm theory, we conceptualize nonlocal boxes as realistic systems featuring instantaneous signaling at the hidden variable level. By introducing randomness into the distribution of the hidden variable the superluminal signaling model is made compatible with the operational no-signalling condition. As our design mimics the famous symmetric key encryption system called {\it One-time Pad} (OTP), we call this the OTP model for nonlocal boxes. We illustrate the efficacy of this model through various esoteric examples related to the non-classical nature of nonlocal boxes. In particular, the breakdown of communication complexity using nonlocal boxes can be better understood in this framework. Additionally, we delve into the Van Dam protocol, revealing its connection to homomorphic encryption studied in cryptography. Exploring potential avenues for encapsulating quantum-realizable nonlocal correlations within our framework, we highlight that the Information Causality principle imposes additional constraints at the hidden variable level. Present work thus orchestrates the results in classical cryptography to improve our understanding of nonlocal correlations and welcomes further research to this connection.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity in High-Dimensional Open Quantum Systems using Next-generation Multicore Optical Fibers</title>

Abstract: With the advent of quantum technology, the interest in communication tasks assisted by quantum systems has increased both in academia and industry. Nonetheless, the transmission of a quantum state in real-world scenarios is bounded by environmental noise, so that the quantum channel is an open quantum system. In this work, we study a high dimensional non-Markovian open quantum system in a multi-core optical fiber by characterizing the environmental interaction as quantum operations, which here correspond to phase flips between pairs of computational basis states. The experimental platform is currently state-of-the-art for space division multiplexing optical fiber communication, which can serve as a robust channel for high-dimensional quantum communication. To test the channel, we perform a quantum communication task in the prepare-and-measure scenario. The non-Markovian nature of the system is demonstrated by implementing a Quantum Vault protocol. A better understanding of the phase noise in multi-core fibers could improve the stability and quality of several real-world communication protocols since they are a prime candidate to increase the telecom data transmission rate worldwide.</description>

      <title>Anomalous bunching of nearly indistinguishable bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The commonly assumed straight link between boson bunching and particle indistinguishability in quantum interferometry has recently been challenged [Nat. Photon. 17, 702 (2023)]. Exploiting the connection between quantum optical interferences and matrix permanents, it appeared that bunching effects may arise that exceed the expected limit of fully indistinguishable particles by injecting peculiar polarization states of partially distinguishable photons in some interferometers. Surprisingly, all states giving rise to such an anomalous bunching were found to be far from the state of fully indistinguishable particles, raising the question of whether this intriguing phenomenon might even possibly exist with nearly indistinguishable particles. Here, we answer this question positively by relating it to a mathematical conjecture on matrix permanents dating from 1986, whose physical interpretation had not yet been unveiled. Using a recently found counterexample to this conjecture, we demonstrate that there is an optical interferometer involving 8 photons in 10 modes such that the probability that all photons bunch into two output modes can be enhanced by suitably perturbing the state of all photons having the same polarization. Such a finding reflects still another -- even less expected -- facet of anomalous boson bunching.</description>

      <title>Redundant string symmetry-based error correction: Demonstrations on quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational power in measurement-based quantum computing stems from the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order of entangled resource states. However, resource states are prone to preparation errors. We introduce a quantum error correction approach using redundant nonlocal symmetry of the resource state. We demonstrate it within a teleportation protocol based on extending the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of one-dimensional cluster states to other graph states. Qubit ZZ-crosstalk errors, which are prominent in quantum devices, degrade the teleportation fidelity of the usual cluster state. However, as we demonstrate on quantum hardware, once we grow graph states with redundant symmetry, perfect teleportation fidelity is restored. We identify the underlying redundant-SPT order as error-protected degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum.</description>

      <title>Photon-resolved Floquet theory II: Open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-resolved Floquet theory keeps track of the photon exchange of a quantum system with a coherent driving field. It thus complements the standard full-counting statistics that counts the number of photons exchanged with incoherent photon modes giving rise to dissipation. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework describing both situations. We develop methods suitable for an analytical evaluation of low-order cumulants of photonic probability distributions. Within this framework we analyze the two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model to demonstrate that the Photon-resolved Floquet theory and the standard full-counting statistics make consistent statistical predictions. Interestingly, we find that the photon-flux fluctuations diverge for vanishing dissipation, which can be related to an entanglement effect between the driven matter system and the driving field. To substantiate our results, we use our framework to describe efficient photon up-conversion in an ac-driven lambda system, that is characterized by a high signal-to-noise ratio. As the framework is non-perturbative and predicts fluctuations, it paves the way towards non-perturbative spectroscopy, which will assist to improve metrological methods.</description>

      <title>Multicritical dissipative phase transitions in the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium steady state of the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model, which exhibits first-order and second-order dissipative phase transitions upon varying the degree of anisotropy between the coupling strengths of rotating and counterrotating terms. Using both semiclassical and quantum approaches, we find a rich phase diagram resulting from the interplay between the anisotropy and the dissipation. First, there exists a bistable phase where both the normal and superradiant phases are stable. Second, there are multicritical points where the phase boundaries for the first- and second-order phase transitions meet. We show that a new set of critical exponents governs the scaling of the multicritical points. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of observing the multicritical transitions and bistability using a pair of trapped ions where the anisotropy can be tuned by controlling the intensity of the Raman transitions. Our study enlarges the scope of critical phenomena that may occur in finite-component quantum systems, which could be useful for applications in critical quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spectrum of matchgate circuits with universal and non-universal resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement level statistics of a quantum state have recently been proposed to be a signature of universality in the underlying quantum circuit. This is a consequence of level repulsion in the entanglement spectra being tied to the integrability of entanglement generated. However, such studies of the level-spacing statistics in the entanglement spectrum have thus far been limited to the output states of Clifford and Haar random circuits on product state inputs. In this work, we provide the first example of a circuit which is composed of a simulable gate set, yet has a Wigner-Dyson distributed entanglement level spectrum without any perturbing universal element. We first show that, for matchgate circuits acting on random product states, Wigner-Dyson statistics emerge by virtue of a single SWAP gate, in direct analog to previous studies on Clifford circuits. We then examine the entanglement spectrum of matchgate circuits with varied input states, and find a sharp jump in the complexity of entanglement as we go from two- to three-qubit entangled inputs. Studying Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits, we find examples of classically simulable circuits whose output states exhibit Wigner-Dyson entanglement level statistics in the absence of universal quantum gate elements. Our study thus provides strong evidence that entanglement spectrum is not strongly connected to notions of simulability in any given quantum circuit.</description>

Abstract: There are two types of universality in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC): ${\it strict}$ and ${\it computational}$. It is well known that the former is stronger than the latter. We present a method of transforming from a certain type of computationally universal MBQC to a strictly universal one. Our method simply replaces a single qubit in a resource state with a Pauli-$Y$ eigenstate. We applied our method to show that hypergraph states can be made strictly universal with only Pauli measurements, while only computationally universal hypergraph states were known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium fluctuation relation is a cornerstone of quantum thermodynamics. It is widely believed that the system-bath heat exchange obeys the famous Jarzynski-W\'{o}jcik fluctuation theorem. However, this theorem is established in the Born-Markovian approximation under the weak-coupling condition. Via studying the energy exchange between a harmonic oscillator and its coupled bath in the non-Markovian dynamics, we establish a generalized quantum fluctuation theorem for energy exchange being valid for arbitrary coupling strength. The Jarzynski-W\'{o}jcik fluctuation theorem is recovered in the weak-coupling limit. We also find the average energy exchange exhibits rich nonequilibrium characteristics when different numbers of system-bath bound states are formed, which suggests a useful way to control the quantum heat. Deepening our understanding of the fluctuation relation in quantum thermodynamics, our result lays the foundation to design high-efficiency quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum maps for single-qubit gates under universal non-Markovian noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise is both ubiquitous and generally deleterious in settings where precision is required. This is especially true in the quantum technology sector where system utility typically decays rapidly under its influence. Understanding the noise in quantum devices is thus a prerequisite for efficient strategies to mitigate or even eliminate its harmful effects. However, this requires resources that are often prohibitive, such that the typically-used noise models rely on simplifications that sometimes depart from experimental reality. Here we derive a compact microscopic error model for single-qubit gates that only requires a single experimental input - the noise power spectral density. Our model goes beyond standard depolarizing or Pauli-twirled noise models, explicitly including non-Clifford and non-Markovian contributions to the dynamical error map. We gauge our predictions for experimentally relevant metrics against established characterization techniques run on a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we find that experimental estimates of average gate errors measured through randomized benchmarking and reconstructed via quantum process tomography are tightly lower-bounded by our analytical estimates, while the depolarizing model overestimates the gate error. Our noise modeling including non-Markovian contributions can be readily applied to established frameworks such as dynamical decoupling and dynamically-corrected gates, or to provide more realistic thresholds for quantum error correction.</description>

Abstract: We propose a non-cryogenic optical quantum memory for noble-gas nuclear spins based on the Atomic Frequency Comb (AFC) protocol. Owing to the hours-long coherence lifetimes of the noble-gas spins and the large bandwidth provided by the AFC independently of the optical depth, we estimate a time-bandwidth product of up to $9.7 \times 10^{15}$ for a realistic experimental configuration, using alkali-metal atoms as mediators. Leveraging this long-lived multimode memory, we propose a fiber-based quantum repeater scheme that could enable entanglement distribution across distances over $2000 \ \mathrm{km}$ with only $8$ elementary links, operating fully without cryogenics. Finally, we discuss how these quantum memories can enhance rates in satellite quantum communication networks.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum walk on the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) lattice with periodic modulation using a digital quantum computer. We investigate various initial states at the single-particle level, considering different hopping modulation strengths and phase factors. Initiating the quantum walk with a particle at the lattice edge reveals the robustness of the edge state, attributed to the topological nature of the AAH model, and displays the influence of the phase factor on this edge state. On the other hand, when the quantum walk begins with a particle in the lattice bulk, we observe a repulsion of the bulk walker from the edge, especially under strong hopping modulation. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the quantum walk of two particles with nearest-neighbour (NN) interaction. We show the repulsion effect in the quantum walk when two walkers originate from the edge and bulk of the lattice due to the interaction. Additionally, when two particles are positioned at NN sites and subjected to strong hopping modulation strength, they exhibit localization in the presence of interaction. We analyze these phenomena by examining physical quantities such as density evolution, two-particle correlation, and participation entropy, and discuss their potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the prospect of a two-dimensional square-lattice geometry for semiconductor spin qubits, we explore the realization of the Parity Architecture with quantum dots (QDs). We present sequences of spin shuttling and quantum gates that implement the Parity Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a lattice constructed of identical unit cells, such that the circuit depth is always constant. We further develop a detailed error model for a hardware-specific analysis of the Parity Architecture and we estimate the errors during one round of Parity QAOA. The model includes a general description of the shuttling errors as a function of the probability distribution function of the valley splitting, which is the main limitation for the performance. We compare our approach to a superconducting transmon qubit chip and we find that with high-fidelity spin shuttling the performance of the spin qubits is competitive or even exceeds the results of the transmons. Finally, we discuss the possibility of decoding the logical quantum state and of quantum error mitigation. We find that already with near-term spin qubit devices a sufficiently low physical error probability can be expected to reliably perform Parity QAOA with a short depth in a regime where the success probability compares favorably to standard QAOA.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on how well the physical transformation on quantum channels can be undone or reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum information and computation devices. In particular, we refine (strengthen) the quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels under the action of quantum superchannels. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which appears to be the superchannel analogue of subunital quantum channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is nondecreasing. We also provide a refined inequality for the entropy change of quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel.</description>

      <title>Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types, including two novel classes. The first class consists of 1 boundary and is generated by sweeping the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaching it to the $X$-boundary that condenses only magnetic fluxes. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism, and hence contains 'magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second class consists of 70 boundaries and is generated by sweeping the $S$-domain wall across a codimension-1 submanifold and attaching it to the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory, equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes, where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) defects. New boundaries are produced whenever the corresponding symmetry of the SPT defect remains unbroken on the boundary. Applications of the magic boundaries include implementing fault-tolerant non-Clifford logical gates, e.g., in the context of fractal topological codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum plasmonic sensor using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry that measures the refractive index of an analyte, embedded in a plasmonic beam splitter composed of a dual-Kretschmann configuration, which serves as a frustrated total internal reflection beamsplitter. The sensing performance of the HOM interferometry, combined with single-photon detectors, is evaluated through Fisher information for estimation of the refractive index of the analyte. This is subsequently compared with the classical benchmark that considers the injection of a coherent state of light into the plasmonic beamsplitter. By varying the wavelength of the single photons and the refractive index of the analyte, we identify a wide range where a 50 % quantum enhancement is achieved and discuss the observed behaviors in comparison with the classical benchmark. We expect this study to provide a useful insight into the advancement of quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, with direct implications for a wide range of nanophotonic beamsplitter structures.</description>

      <title>ACE: A general-purpose non-Markovian open quantum systems simulation toolkit based on process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a general-purpose computational toolkit for simulating open quantum systems, which provides numerically exact solutions for composites of zero-dimensional quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to multiple, quite general non-Markovian environments. It is based on process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs), which efficiently encapsulate environment influences. The code features implementations of several PT-MPO algorithms, in particular, Automated Compression of Environments (ACE) for general environments comprised of independent modes as well as schemes for generalized spin boson models. The latter includes a divide-and-conquer scheme for periodic PT-MPOs, which enable million time step simulations for realistic models. PT-MPOs can be precalculated and reused for efficiently probing different time-dependent system Hamiltonians. They can also be stacked together and combined to provide numerically complete solutions of small networks of open quantum systems. The code is written in C++ and is fully controllable by configuration files, for which we have developed a versatile and compact human-readable format.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of General Noise Model Parameters from Surface Code's Syndrome Statistics</title>

Abstract: Active research on the surface code shows that its decoding performance can be significantly enhanced by utilizing the information of the noise model and optimizing the grid shape and decoding algorithm. Usually, the parameters in the noise model for the quantum error correction code must be prepared separately using some method, such as the quantum process tomography. There is a strong need to perform noise model estimation in parallel with the syndrome measurement during decoding to avoid the demanding prior tomography procedure. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-explored for Pauli noise, it remains under-studied for more complex noise models like amplitude damping. In this paper, we propose general noise model Bayesian inference methods that integrate the surface code's tensor network simulator, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, where the noise parameters are constant and do not change, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic situation, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present the numerical results of applying the proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and non-uniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</description>

      <title>Measuring multipartite quantum correlations by thermodynamic work extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04058</link>

Abstract: Quantum correlations are at the core of quantum mechanics and play a crucial role in various fields. While bipartite quantum correlations have been extensively studied, multipartite quantum correlations in many-body systems remain elusive due to their complex structure. In particular, a primary challenge lies in the fact that the calculation of multipartite quantum correlation measure often requires exponential cost. In this work, we tackle this problem by adopting a thermodynamic approach; we introduce a measure of multipartite quantum correlations based on the difference in extractable thermodynamic work by global operations and local operations and classical communication (LOCC). This can be regarded as a multipartite generalization of the work deficit, which has attracted attention as a thermodynamic measure of bipartite quantum correlation. A distinguishing feature of the thermodynamic approach to multipartite quantum correlation is that we can compare the degree of quantum correlations with clear operational meaning. Importantly, we develop an efficient calculation method of the multipartite work deficit. This efficient method works for a special class of quantum many-body systems described by matrix product states (MPS), where the numerical cost is shown to be proportional to the system size, significantly reducing the exponential cost required for the direct calculations. We demonstrate this efficient method in the AKLT state and the cluster state, and analytically obtain the exact values of this measure. We further show that a quantum phase transition described by MPS is well captured by the multipartite work deficit. This shows that the multipartite work deficit does not only highlight the fundamental connection between multipartite quantum correlations and quantum thermodynamics, but also serves as an efficiently-computable probe of the structures of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic parametrizations for gate set tomography under coloured noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gate set tomography (GST) allows for a self-consistent characterization of noisy quantum information processors. The standard device-agnostic approach treats the QIPs as black boxes that are only constrained by the laws of physics, attaining full generality at a considerable resource cost: numerous circuits built from the gate set must be run in order to amplify each of the gate set parameters. In this work, we show that a microscopic parametrization of quantum gates under time-correlated noise on the driving phase, motivated by recent experiments with trapped-ion gates, reduces the required resources enabling a more efficient version of GST. By making use of the formalism of filter functions over the noise spectral densities, we discuss the minimal parametrizations of the gate set that include the effect of finite correlation times and non-Markovian quantum evolutions during the individual gates. We compare the estimated gate sets obtained by our method and the standard long-sequence GST, discussing their accuracies in terms of established metrics, as well as showcasing the advantages of the parametrized approach in terms of the sampling complexity for specific examples.</description>

      <title>ArtA: Automating Design Space Exploration of Spin Qubit Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the fast-paced field of quantum computing, identifying the architectural characteristics that will enable quantum processors to achieve high performance across a diverse range of quantum algorithms continues to pose a significant challenge. Given the extensive and costly nature of experimentally testing different designs, this paper introduces the first Design Space Exploration (DSE) for quantum-dot spin-qubit architectures. Utilizing the upgraded SpinQ compilation framework, this study explores a substantial design space comprising 29,312 spin-qubit-based architectures and applies an innovative optimization tool, ArtA (Artificial Architect), to speed up the design space traversal. ArtA can leverage 17 optimization configurations, significantly reducing exploration times by up to 99.1% compared to a traditional brute force approach while maintaining the same result quality. After a comprehensive evaluation of best-matching optimization configurations per quantum circuit, ArtA suggests specific and universal architectural features that provide optimal performance across the examined circuits. Our work demonstrates that the synergy between DSE methodologies and optimization algorithms can effectively be deployed to provide useful suggestions to quantum processor designers.</description>

      <title>Realizing Topological Superconductivity in Tunable Bose-Fermi Mixtures with Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a promising platform for investigating exotic correlated states of matter. Here, we propose to engineer Bose-Fermi mixtures in these systems by coupling inter-layer excitons to doped charges in a trilayer structure. Their interactions are determined by the inter-layer trion, whose spin-selective nature allows excitons to mediate an attractive interaction between charge carriers of only one spin species. Remarkably, we find that this causes the system to become unstable to topological p+ip superconductivity at low temperatures. We then demonstrate a general mechanism to develop and control this unconventional state by tuning the trion binding energy using a solid-state Feshbach resonance.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectrum of the Dirac hamiltonian in one space dimension for a single electron in the electrostatic potential of a point nucleus, in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the nucleus is assumed fixed at the origin. The potential is screened at large distances so that it goes to zero exponentially at spatial infinity. We show that the hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint, the essential spectrum has the usual gap $(-mc^2,mc^2)$ in it, and that there are only finitely many eigenvalues in that gap, corresponding to ground and excited states for the system. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian and the heteroclinic saddle-saddle connectors of a certain dynamical system on a finite cylinder. We use this correspondence to study how the number of bound states changes with the nuclear charge.</description>

      <title>Spin noise spectroscopy of an alignment-based atomic magnetometer</title>

Abstract: Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are revolutionising the task of magnetic-field sensing due to their extremely high sensitivity combined with technological improvements in miniaturisation which have led to compact and portable devices. OPMs can be based on spin-oriented or spin-aligned atomic ensembles which are spin-polarized through optical pumping with circular or linear polarized light, respectively. Characterisation of OPMs and the dynamical properties of their noise is important for applications in real-time sensing tasks. In our work, we experimentally perform spin noise spectroscopy of an alignment-based magnetometer. Moreover, we propose a stochastic model that predicts the noise power spectra exhibited by the device when, apart from the strong magnetic field responsible for the Larmor precession of the spin, white noise is applied in the perpendicular direction aligned with the pumping-probing beam. By varying the strength of the noise applied as well as the linear-polarisation angle of incoming light, we verify the model to accurately predict the heights of the Larmor-induced spectral peaks and their corresponding line-widths. Our work paves the way for alignment-based magnetometers to become operational in real-time sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>Tunneling dynamics of $^{164}$Dy supersolids and droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tunneling dynamics of a magnetic $^{164}$Dy quantum gas in an elongated or pancake skewed double-well trap is investigated with a time-dependent extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Upon lifting the energy offset, different tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the pancake-like trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet regimes.</description>

      <title>Parametric Matrix Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Dual chiral density wave induced oscillating Casimir effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is known to be induced from photon fields confined by a small volume, and also its fermionic counterpart has been predicted in a wide range of quantum systems. Here, we investigate what types of Casimir effects can occur from quark fields in dense and thin quark matter. In particular, in the dual chiral density wave, which is a possible ground state of dense quark matter, we find that the Casimir energy oscillates as a function of the thickness of matter. This oscillating Casimir effect is regarded as an analog of that in Weyl semimetals and is attributed to the Weyl points in the momentum space of quark fields. In addition, we show that an oscillation is also induced from the quark Fermi sea, and the total Casimir energy is composed of multiple oscillations.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. For repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments on the triangular lattice supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on explicitly calculated pair interactions for ${}^{87}$Rb and with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>
