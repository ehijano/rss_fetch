      <title>Model-Adaptive Approach to Dynamic Discrete Choice Models with Large State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating dynamic discrete choice models with large state spaces poses computational difficulties. This paper develops a novel model-adaptive approach to solve the linear system of fixed point equations of the policy valuation operator. We propose a model-adaptive sieve space, constructed by iteratively augmenting the space with the residual from the previous iteration. We show both theoretically and numerically that model-adaptive sieves dramatically improve performance. In particular, the approximation error decays at a superlinear rate in the sieve dimension, unlike a linear rate achieved using conventional methods. Our method works for both conditional choice probability estimators and full-solution estimators with policy iteration. We apply the method to analyze consumer demand for laundry detergent using Kantar's Worldpanel Take Home data. On average, our method is 51.5% faster than the conventional methods in solving the dynamic programming problem, making the Bayesian MCMC estimator computationally feasible. The results confirm the computational efficiency of our method in practice.</description>

      <title>Untestability of Average Slutsky Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slutsky symmetry and negative semidefiniteness are necessary and sufficient conditions for the rationality of demand functions. While the empirical implications of Slutsky negative semidefiniteness in repeated cross-sectional demand data are well understood, the empirical content of Slutsky symmetry remains largely unexplored. This paper takes an important first step toward addressing this gap. We demonstrate that the average Slutsky matrix is not identified and that its identified set always contains a symmetric matrix. A key implication of our findings is that the symmetry of the average Slutsky matrix is untestable, and consequently, individual Slutsky symmetry cannot be tested using the average Slutsky matrix.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Population Causal Inference for Models of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to problems of interference in (exogenous) treatments, models of interference in unit-specific (endogenous) outcomes do not usually produce a reduced-form representation where outcomes depend on other units' treatment status only at a short network distance, or only through a known exposure mapping. This remains true if the structural mechanism depends on outcomes of peers only at a short network distance, or through a known exposure mapping. In this paper, we first define causal estimands that are identified and estimable from a single experiment on the network under minimal assumptions on the structure of interference, and which represent average partial causal responses which generally vary with other global features of the realized assignment. Under a fixed-population, design-based approach, we show unbiasedness, consistency and asymptotic normality for inverse-probability weighting (IPW) estimators for those causal parameters from a randomized experiment on a single network. We also analyze more closely the case of marginal interventions in a model of equilibrium with smooth response functions where we can recover LATE-type weighted averages of derivatives of those response functions. Under additional structural assumptions, these "agnostic" causal estimands can be combined to recover model parameters, but also retain their less restrictive causal interpretation.</description>

      <title>PUATE: Semiparametric Efficient Average Treatment Effect Estimation from Treated (Positive) and Unlabeled Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs), defined as the difference in expected outcomes between treatment and control groups, is a central topic in causal inference. This study develops semiparametric efficient estimators for ATE estimation in a setting where only a treatment group and an unknown group-comprising units for which it is unclear whether they received the treatment or control-are observable. This scenario represents a variant of learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) and can be regarded as a special case of ATE estimation with missing data. For this setting, we derive semiparametric efficiency bounds, which provide lower bounds on the asymptotic variance of regular estimators. We then propose semiparametric efficient ATE estimators whose asymptotic variance aligns with these efficiency bounds. Our findings contribute to causal inference with missing data and weakly supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Merger Analysis with Latent Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07684v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard empirical tools for merger analysis assume price data, which are often unavailable. I characterize sufficient conditions for identifying the unilateral effects of mergers without price data using the first-order approach and merger simulation. Data on merging firms' revenues, margins, and revenue diversion ratios are sufficient to identify their gross upward pricing pressure indices and compensating marginal cost reductions. Standard discrete-continuous demand assumptions facilitate the identification of revenue diversion ratios as well as the feasibility of merger simulation in terms of percentage change in price. I apply the framework to the Albertsons/Safeway (2015) and Staples/Office Depot (2016) mergers.</description>

      <title>The Global Carbon Budget as a cointegrated system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Global Carbon Budget, maintained by the Global Carbon Project, summarizes Earth's global carbon cycle through four annual time series beginning in 1959: atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions, and CO$_2$ uptake by land and ocean. We analyze these four time series as a multivariate (cointegrated) system. Statistical tests show that the four time series are cointegrated with rank three and identify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions as the single stochastic trend driving the nonstationary dynamics of the system. The three cointegrated relations correspond to the physical relations that the sinks are linearly related to atmospheric concentrations and that the change in concentrations equals emissions minus the combined uptake by land and ocean. Furthermore, likelihood ratio tests show that a parametrically restricted error-correction model that embodies these physical relations and accounts for the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation cannot be rejected on the data. The model can be used for both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. In an application of the latter, we demonstrate that projections based on this model, using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios, yield results consistent with established climate science.</description>
