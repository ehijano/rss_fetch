      <title>Self-gravitating Superfluids: The Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) that is used to model self-gravitating superfluid systems, which include gravitationally collapsed boson and axion stars and dark-matter haloes. We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.</description>

      <title>A VERITAS view of HESS J1857+026 within a multi-wavelength analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HESS J1857+026 remains a mysterious gamma-ray emitter since its discovery in 2008. Despite the disclosure of a nearby pulsar and multiple studies in the high-energy (HE, E &gt; 100 MeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E &gt; 100 GeV) regimes, there have been no confirmed counterparts (e.g., an SNR shell or other extended structure) in X-ray or other wavelengths. We present the result of our study of the VHE emission of HESS~J1857+026 with VERITAS as part of a multi-wavelength investigation to uncover its emission mechanisms. Our result confirms the extended nature of the source and we characterize its spectral and morphological features in the VHE band. Using the morphology of the source revealed in our analysis, we also explore the underlying transport process of a possible electron population in a leptonic PWN scenario for the gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background with an X-ray Pulsar Timing Array from NICER observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) using X-ray pulsar timing data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(\textit{NICER}). By analyzing six millisecond pulsars over a six-year observational baseline, we employed a Bayesian framework to model noise components and search for a common red signal consistent with a GWB from supermassive black hole binaries (assuming a spectral index $\gamma_{\rm gwb}=13/3$). Our results show no significant evidence for a GWB, yielding a 95\% upper limit of $\log_{10}(A_{\rm gwb})&lt;-13.4$. Weak evidence for Hellings-Downs spatial correlations was found (S=2.5), though the signal remains statistically inconclusive. Compared to radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsar timing arrays, the \textit{NICER} constraint is currently less stringent but demonstrates the feasibility of X-ray timing with \textit{NICER} for GWB studies and highlights the potential for improved sensitivity with future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Pulsed radio emission from a Central Compact Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the population of compact binary mergers and their formation pathways with gravitational waves through the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.</description>

      <title>On Signatures of a Possible New Physics Resonance in Atmospheric Air Showers Using a Parameterized Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parameterized model of atmospheric particle showers initiated by cosmic rays. Few physics shower parameters are tuned in a comparison to the Conex generator. Resulting shower properties are studied, with a comment on the cases where multiple shower maxima develop.
  Finally, we implement simple models of new physics resonance of masses of 100 GeV and 1 TeV and examine their effects on the shower profile, depth and maximum variation in dependence of the decay channel of the hypothetical resonance. It is shown that a new resonance effects can appear at the energy threshold and can persist for about a decade in $\log_{10} E/\mathrm{eV}$.
  Various assumed decay modes of the hypothetical resonance have different effects on the direction and shape of the modified average shower depth as function of the energy, with possible implications for current or future measurements. It is shown that, within the presented model, the visibility of the resonance in modified shower depth strongly depends on the resonance width. A significant modification at 10\% width gradually diminishes towards the percent-level width. We propose that looking at the 2D distributions of the two first individual shower moments can also reveal signatures of new physics.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Measurements with the CTAO Southern Array: The Case for Pulsar Wind Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and recent advances in reconstruction of gamma-ray photons with Cherenkov telescopes are bound to push the limit of angular resolution to an unprecedented precision of less than one arcminute at tens of TeV. Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous.</description>

      <title>Radio studies of supernovae 1979C, 1986J and 2006X with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) studies of supernovae SN 1979C, SN 1986J, and SN 2006X, focusing on new observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). For Type Ia SN 2006X, we derive a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.7 mJy at 0.146 GHz, and using radio emission models based on the CS15DD2 explosion model, we constrain the circumstellar density to $n_{\rm H} \lesssim 10$ cm$^{-3}$ for the microphysical parameters $\epsilon_{\rm rel} = \epsilon_{\rm B} = 0.01$. SN 1979C is clearly detected in the LoTSS image with a flux density of $4.6 \pm 0.36$ mJy nearly 40 years postexplosion. Modeling its radio evolution suggests a steep flux decay ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-2.1}$) between 22 and 42 years, a break in the spectrum near 1.5 GHz possibly due to synchrotron cooling, a progenitor mass of $\sim 13$ solar masses, and a progressive steepening with velocity for the density slope of the supernova ejecta. Our findings for SN 1979C contradict scenarios involving central compact object emission, and we obtain X-ray temperatures close to those derived from recent observations. For SN 1986J, we present the first ILT image showing a flux density of $6.77\pm0.2$ mJy at 0.146 GHz. The spectral index of the shell emission is found to be $0.66\pm0.03$, consistent with previous estimates, although variations at low frequencies warrant further investigation. Our results highlight the power of LOFAR for studying long-term radio evolution in supernovae.</description>

      <title>Constraining black hole spin in PG 1535+547 amidst complex multi-layered absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the 'complex' NLS1 PG 1535+547 at redshift $z=0.038$. These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\sim0.3-5\times10^{23}\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($\Gamma\approx 2.2\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R&gt;7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a&gt;0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction.</description>

      <title>Validating the performance of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland using cosmic-ray air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is currently under construction with the aim to detect neutrinos with energies beyond $\sim 10\,\mathrm{PeV}$. A critical part of early detector commissioning is the study of detector characteristics and potential backgrounds, for which cosmic rays play a crucial role. In this article, we report that the number of cosmic rays detected with RNO-G's shallow antennas is consistent with expectations. We further verified the agreement in the observed cosmic-ray signal shape with expectations from simulations after careful treatment of the detector systematics. Finally, we find that the reconstructed arrival direction, energy, and polarization of the cosmic-ray candidates agrees with expectations. Throughout this study, we identified detector shortcomings that are mitigated going forward. Overall, the analysis presented here is an essential first step towards validating the detector and high-fidelity neutrino detection with RNO-G in the future.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Prompt Atmospheric Neutrino Flux Combining IceCube's Cascade and Track Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos for more than a decade. A relevant background to the astrophysical flux is prompt atmospheric neutrinos, originating from the decay of charmed mesons produced in cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production rate of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and consequently, the prompt neutrino flux, remains uncertain and has not yet been observed by neutrino detectors. An accurate measurement of this flux would enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics such as hadronic interactions in high-energy cosmic-ray-induced air showers and the nucleon structure. Furthermore, an experimental characterization of this background flux will improve the precision of astrophysical neutrino flux spectral measurements. In this work, we perform a combined fit of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube to constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux. Given that the prompt flux is a sub-dominant contribution, treating systematic uncertainties arising from the potential mis-modeling of the conventional and astrophysical neutrino fluxes is critical for its measurement. Our analysis yields a non-zero best-fit result, which is, however, consistent with the null hypothesis of no prompt flux within one standard deviation. Consequently, we establish an upper bound on the flux at $4\times 10^{-16}$ (GeV m$^2$ s sr)$^{-1}$ at 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field spreading from stellar and galactic dynamos into the exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.</description>

Abstract: As the fiftieth anniversary of our common effort in the field of relativistic astrophysics is approaching, we offer a new look to some of our acquired knowledge in a more complete view, which evidence previous unnoticed connections. They are gaining due prominence in reaching a more complete picture evidencing the main results.
  We outline the history of GRB observations along with a summary of the contributions made by our group to develop the BdHN interpreting model. We show the seven Episodes characterizing the most powerful BdHNe I occurred to date: GRB 190114C and GRB 220101A. New inferences for the explanation of the highest energy radiation in the TeV are presented.</description>

      <title>Equilibriums of extremely magnetized compact stars with force-free magnetotunnels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical solutions for stationary and axisymmetric equilibriums of compact stars associated with extremely strong magnetic fields. The interior of the compact stars is assumed to satisfy ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) conditions, while in the region of negligible mass density the force-free conditions or electromagnetic vacuum are assumed. Solving all components of Einstein's equations, Maxwell's equations, ideal MHD equations, and force-free conditions, equilibriums of rotating compact stars associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields are obtained. It is found that in the extreme cases the strong mixed magnetic fields concentrating in a toroidal region near the equatorial surface expel the matter and form a force-free toroidal magnetotunnel. We also introduce a new differential rotation law for computing solutions associated with force-free magnetosphere, and present other extreme models without the magnetotunnel.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>The final stages of binary evolution using multi-messenger studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracompact Galactic binaries with orbital periods below an hour are among the strongest persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the mHz band and will constitute the dominant population detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Tens of thousands are predicted to be individually resolved, with a substantial fraction bright enough for electromagnetic (EM) follow-up. This opens an unprecedented multi-messenger window on compact binary evolution, tidal interactions, mass transfer, and the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. We highlight key science enabled by joint GW + EM constraints and emphasize the critical need for rapid, high-cadence spectroscopic capabilities in the 2040s. In particular, the most compact (&lt;10 min) binaries detected by LISA will require read-noise-free, zero-dead-time spectroscopic facilities, potentially realized through coordinated arrays of telescopes with time-staggered exposures, to measure radial velocities, tidal heating signatures, and orbital evolution with the precision needed for transformative multi-messenger studies.</description>

      <title>The supernova Ia progenitor problem in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.</description>

      <title>Fermion Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma (with Applications to Neutron Stars)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal field theory with fermion fields of any kind for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also average angular momentum. This extends a previous study that focused on scalar fields, to all fermion-scalar theories. Both Dirac and Majorana fermions and both Dirac and Majorana masses are covered. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. These general results are applied to physical situations typical of neutron stars, which are often quickly rotating: the Fermi surface and Fermi momentum, the average energy, number density and angular momentum for degenerate fermions and particle production (such as neutrino production from rotating neutron stars, e.g. pulsars). In particular, it is shown that the neutrino production rate due to the direct URCA (DU) processes grows indefinitely as the angular velocity approaches the inverse linear size of the plasma and, therefore, rotation can significantly increase this rate.</description>

      <title>A Search for Binary Black Hole Mergers in LIGO O1-O3 Data with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO from the binary black hole merger GW150914, gravitational wave astronomy has developed significantly, with over 200 compact binary merger events cataloged. The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Origin of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations and Accretion Process in X-Ray Binaries around Quantum Lee-Wick Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the accretion dynamics and test particle motion around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric Lee-Wick black hole (BH) to reveal how the model parameters affect orbital stability and the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binary systems. The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Theory Bounds on the Equation of State of Dense QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive bounds on the equation of state of cold, dense matter by extending the causal, model-agnostic interpolation between chiral effective field theory and perturbative calculations with a microscopic constraint from relativistic kinetic theory. The additional condition restricts the stiffest admissible behavior of the equation of state and systematically reduces the range of allowed equations of state, with the strongest effect at high densities. The resulting bounds remain consistent with known low- and high-density limits, while the strength of the constraint depends on the density above which the kinetic-theory condition is applied. These bounds can be readily incorporated into future studies of cold, dense matter and used to assess the impact of microscopic stability conditions on equation-of-state inference.</description>

      <title>GW231123: Overlapping Gravitational Wave Signals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered gravitational wave event GW231123 was interpreted as the merger of two black holes with a total mass of 190-265 $M_\odot$, making it the heaviest such merger detected to date. Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

      <title>Trails of clouds in binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.</description>

      <title>Revisit the periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts with updated sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since FRB 200428 has been found to be associated with an X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, it is interesting to explore whether the magnetar bursts also follow the similar active periodic behavior as some repeating FRBs. Previous studies show that there is possible period about 230 day in SGR J1935+2154 bursts. Here, we collected an updated burst sample from SGR J1935+2154, including all bursts reported by Fermi/GBM and GECAM till 2022 January. We also developed a targeted search pipeline to reveal more bursts from SGR J1935+2154 in the Fermi/GBM data from 2008 August to 2014 December (i.e. before the first burst detected by Swift/BAT). With this burst sample, we re-analyzed the possible periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts using the Period Folding and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram methods. Our results show that the periodicity $\sim$238 day reported in literature is probably fake and the observation effects may introduce false periods (i.e. 55 day) according to simulation tests. We find that, for the current burst sample, the most probable period is 126.88$\pm$2.05 day, which could be interpreted as the precession of the magnetar. However, we note that the whole burst history is very complicated and difficult to be perfectly accommodated with any period reported thus far, therefore more monitoring observations of SGR J1935+2154 are required to test any periodicity hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conducting cylinder with a uniform magnetic field along its axis and radial temperature gradient is considered at the stationary state. At large temperature gradients the azimuthal Hall electrical current creates the axial magnetic field which strength may be comparable with the original one. It is shown, that the magnetic field, generated by the azimuthal Hall current, leads to the decrease of magnetic field originated by external sources, and this suppression increases with increase of the electromotive force, connected with a thermodiffusion. Obtained results can help to investigate influence of the Hall current on the coupled magneto-thermal evolution of magnetic and electric fields in neutron stars, white dwarfs, and, possibly, in a laboratory facilities.</description>

      <title>X-ray Binaries: a potential dominant contributor to the cosmic ray spectral knee structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ``PeVatrons" refer to astrophysical sources capable of accelerating particles to energies $\sim$PeV and higher, potentially contributing to the cosmic ray spectrum in the knee region. Recently, HAWC and LHAASO have discovered a new type PeVatrons -- X-ray binaries, allowing us to investigate in greater depth of the contributions of these sources to cosmic rays around the knee region. There are hundreds of X-ray binaries in our galaxy observed, which are potential PeVatrons.In this work, we derive the radial distribution of X-ray binaries in the Galaxy. Then we use the DRAGON package to calculate energy spectrum, anisotropy of cosmic rays as well as the resulting diffuse gamma ray emissions, after considering them as factories of cosmic rays in the knee energy bands. Our findings show that the contributions from X-ray binary PeVatrons may be dominant. More X-ray binary PeVatrons can be observed by LHAASO and HAWC in the future, and will confirm the contribution of X-ray binaries to high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs). Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.</description>

      <title>IGR J17091-3624: Newly Formed Periodic Dips and Multiwavelength Activity During the 2025 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) candidate IGR J17091-3624 experienced a hard-state-only outburst in 2025. In this paper, we show that IXPE detected a series of intermittent X-ray dips, spanning a total interval of ~1 day. Subsequent observations with NICER, EP, NuSTAR, and Swift reveal that these dips recur with a period of 2.83$\pm$0.07 days and are accompanied by an increase in spectral hardness. This is the first time such quasi-periodic dipping behavior has been observed in this target since discovery. Our spectral analysis shows that the dips can be explained by obscuration from an ionized absorber characterized by an ionization parameter of $log{\xi}$ ~1-3 erg cm s$^{-1}$ and an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N^{\rm zxipcf}_{\rm H}$~(1-30)$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The periodic reappearance of the absorber is likely caused by obscuring material located in the outer accretion disk, modulated by the binary orbital period. If confirmed, this period would suggest that the donor star in IGR J17091-3624 has deviated from the standard main-sequence evolutionary path and is likely a (partially) stripped giant. In the optical band, no significant periodicity or correlation with the X-ray dips was detected, whereas the radio counterpart exhibited a flat to steep spectrum, in contrast to the inverted spectrum typically observed during the hard state of LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Probing Picohertz Gravitational Waves with Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data. However, signatures of these low-frequency signals persist in the slow variation of pulsar timing parameters. In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Galactic Center in the Sub-MeV Gamma-Ray Band with an Electron-Tracking Compton Camera</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the direct detection of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center in the 150--600~keV band using the electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC), which has a wide field of view of 3.1~sr and represents the first application of this linear, imaging-spectroscopy method to observations of the Galactic center. A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\sigma$ excess \revise{over the background} in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\pm~1.4)~\times~10^{-2}$~photons~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\sigma$ level. While remaining subject to a systematic uncertainty of at most 12\% in the detector response and to uncertainties in the inverse-Compton modeling, this difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole? Yes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 250702B is a unique astrophysical transient characterised by its nature as a repeating gamma-ray trigger. Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed MeV gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.</description>

Abstract: We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.</description>

      <title>SN 2024cld: unveiling the complex mass-loss histories of evolved supergiant progenitors to core collapse supernovae</title>

Abstract: Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a slowly-evolving late time light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure: a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind. We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved supergiant stars from afar.</description>

      <title>A Wind-Driven Origin for the Firework Morphology of the Supernova Remnant Pa 30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pa 30 -- the likely remnant of the Galactic type Iax supernova of 1181 AD -- displays an unusual, firework-like morphology, consisting of radial filaments extending from a common center, where a white dwarf (WD) currently drives a very fast wind (speed $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$). We propose the filaments arose from the Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable nature of the interface between the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the shocked wind launched by the natal WD; the filaments then elongated intact due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-stable nature of the large initial density contrast between the wind and CSM, supplemented by the slowly declining wind density profile (relative to homologously expanding ejecta). To support this interpretation, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and derive the filament properties, including their speed, density, and temperature, all of which are consistent with observations. We suggest the filaments elongate until the wind and CSM densities become comparable at the contact discontinuity, which occurs within 1--10 years, and then truncate because the RTI halts. The subsequent KHI growth timescale across the current width of the filaments is longer than the age of Pa 30, so they remain intact. The filament-less central region in Pa 30 is therefore more likely a consequence of the finite timescale over which the RTI operates, rather than a wind termination shock. In general, firework-like filaments may form in other systems, provided there is a sufficiently large density contrast between the ejecta and its surroundings.</description>

      <title>The Polarized X-ray Universe: Insights and Discoveries</title>

Abstract: Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.</description>

      <title>Inference of Neutron Star Mass Distributions and the Equation of State from Multi-messenger Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a combined model to incorporate neutron star (NS) mass measurements with electromagnetic mass-radius constraints and gravitational-wave observations using Bayesian inference. We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, we show for the first time that using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass, rather than a nuisance parameter in the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytropic EoSs, the maximum mass posterior changes from $M_\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\odot$ at 90% confidence level. This change in prior also impacts the shape of the mass distribution for NSs in LMXB, shifting the posterior for the population mean from $1.51_{-0.13}^{+0.13} M_\odot$ to $1.62_{-0.12}^{+0.15} M_\odot$ at 68% confidence level.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Interpretation of Fermi-LAT Pulsars: Fundamental-Plane Death Border, Visibility Thresholds, and GeV-TeV Unification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework that links equatorial-current-sheet (ECS) physics to catalog-level, phase-averaged gamma-ray pulsar properties. Guided by analytic scalings and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar ``Fundamental Plane'' (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\dot{\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\dot{\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\dot{\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\gamma\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\mu^\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts a MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases in parameter estimation on LISA binaries: The effect of excluding higher harmonics for non-spinning binaries</title>

Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity achieved by the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will allow us to observe gravitational-wave signals from the mergers of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the hundreds, or even thousands. At such high SNR, our ability to precisely infer the parameters of an MBHB from the detected signal will be limited by the accuracy of the waveform templates we use. In this paper, we explore the systematic biases that arise in parameter estimation if we use waveform templates that do not model radiation in higher-order multipoles. This is an important consideration for the large fraction of high-mass events expected to be observed with LISA. We examine how the biases change for MBHB events with different total masses, mass ratios, and inclination angles. We find that systematic biases due to insufficient mode content are severe for events with total redshifted mass $\gtrsim10^6\,M_\odot$. We then compare several methods of predicting such systematic biases without performing a full Bayesian parameter estimation. In particular, we show that through direct likelihood optimization it is possible to predict systematic biases with remarkable computational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we devise a method to construct approximate waveforms including angular multipoles with $\ell\geq5$ to better understand how many additional modes (beyond the ones available in current approximants) might be required to perform unbiased parameter estimation on the MBHB signals detected by LISA.</description>

Abstract: Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.</description>

Abstract: The dipole response of a nuclear system, characterized by its photon strength function (PSF), is a key ingredient of many applications of nuclear structure, ranging from nuclear reactor design and nuclear waste transmutation to astrophysical models of nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. While the majority of those applications require the knowledge of PSF of mid-mass and heavy nuclei, there is now renewed interest in $E1$ strength distributions of light nuclei in the framework of the PANDORA project, which aims at an understanding of the mass distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic radiation (UHECR).UHECR is of extragalactic origin and its interaction along the travel path is dominated by photoabsorption of cosmic background radiation boosted to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) energy region in the center-of-mass system. Thus, systematic knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections in light nuclei and of their subsequent particle decay is required. The purpose of this work is to enhance the database of available theoretical evaluations of PSF of light nuclei that are necessary in the studies of UHECR propagation. We employ the Configuration Interaction Shell Model (CI-SM) approach to provide predictions of $E1$ dipole response for $p$ and $sd$-shell nuclei, with mass number $A$ between 7 and 40. Theoretical predictions are compared to available data and to existing predictions from phenomenological and microscopic models. Finally, the impact of using of CI-SM PSF on the predicted propagation of a $^{40}$Ca UHECR source is studied.</description>
