      <title>Norm-Stabilized Imaginary-Time Evolution via Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a norm-stabilized imaginary-time evolution (ITE) scheme for the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). Traditional ITE solvers often require explicit renormalization of the wavefunction after each step to preserve norm, which can be disruptive and algorithmically inflexible. We propose an alternative approach in which the evolution is continuously stabilized using an adaptive feedback term mu(tau), proportional to the time derivative of the wavefunction norm. This results in a self-regulating flow that requires no external normalization while preserving convergence toward soliton solutions. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness by comparing the final wavefunction profiles and L2 errors against analytical solutions and baseline methods without feedback. Although this work focuses on the 1D case, the framework is designed to extend naturally to higher dimensions. Future work will explore the behavior of the feedback mechanism in 2D and 3D systems, multi-soliton scenarios, and external potentials.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Hyperparametric solitons in nondegenerate optical parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative solitons and their associated low-noise, chip-scale frequency combs hold great potential for applications in optical communications, spectroscopy, precision time-keeping, and beyond. These applications drive interest in shifting soliton spectra to frequency bands far detuned from the telecom's C-band pump sources. Recent demonstrations have utilized second-harmonic generation and degenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) to shift soliton combs away from the primary pump. However, these approaches lack the tunability offered by nondegenerate OPOs. This work presents a proof-of-principle demonstration of solitons in a silicon-nitride microresonator-based nondegenerate OPO system with engineered dispersion and optimized coupling rates. By pumping a relatively low-Q resonance in the C-band, we excite a signal soliton comb centred around a far-detuned, high-Q O-band resonance. This process also generates repetition-rate-locked combs at the pump and idler frequencies, with the latter occurring at a wavelength beyond
  2$\mu$m. We demonstrate that the solitons supported by this platform are distinct from other families of dissipative solitons and call them - hyperparametric solitons. They emerge when the narrow-band signal mode, phase-matched under negative pump detuning, reaches sufficient power to drive bistability in the parametric signal. We investigate the properties of hyperparametric solitons, including their parametrically generated background and multisoliton states, both experimentally and through theoretical modelling.</description>
