      <title>$XY$-VBS phase boundary for the square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ $XXZ$ model with the ring exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ $XXZ$ model with the ring-exchange interaction $K$ was investigated numerically. As for the hard-core-boson model with the nearest-neighbor hopping $J_1/2$, namely, the $J_1$-$K$ $XY$ model, it has been reported that the ring exchange leads to a variety of exotic phases such as the valence-bond-solid (VBS) phase. In this paper, we extend the parameter space in order to investigate the phase boundary between the $XY$ (superfluid) and VBS phases. A notable feature is that the phase boundary terminates at the fully-frustrated point, $J_2/J_1 \to 0.5^-$. As a scaling parameter for the multi-criticality, the distance from the multi-critical point $\delta (\ge 0)$ is introduced. In order to detect the phase transition, we employed the high-order fidelity susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}_F$, which is readily evaluated via the exact-diagonalization scheme. As a demonstration, for a fixed value of $\delta$, the $XY$-VBS criticality was analyzed by the probe $\chi^{(3)}_F$. Thereby, with properly scaling $\delta$, the $\chi^{(3)}_F$ data were cast into the crossover-scaling formula to determine the multi-criticality.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable quantum spin-glass model with 1RSB-fullRSB transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum spin-glass model, a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a transverse mean-field type random magnet. We rigorously derive the exact expression of the free energy of this model at the entire parameter region. The obtained exact solution implies the existence of a 1RSB-fullRSB transition at low temperatures. Our technique can be applied to general classical spin models, telling that any solvable classical spin model has its solvable quantum counterpart.</description>

      <title>A multicritical point of $S = 1$ XXZ chain with single ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We research the ground state of the $S = 1$ XXZ spin chain with single ion anisotropy, focusing on XY1, XY2 (Spin Nematic), Neel, Haldane phases. Recently, it was reported that the four phases did not intersect at a single point using conventional numerical methods, which is inconsistent with the bosonization theory. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we propose a unified method to determine phase boundaries by combining conformal field theory (CFT) with numerical diagonalization. And we discuss the symmetry and universality class of the multicritical point.</description>

      <title>Confinement and false vacuum decay on the Potts quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that in the former case, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. In the latter case, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, pointing to a hitherto unknown shortcoming of the membrane picture in describing such systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating the population-level effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions when transmission rates of COVID-19 vary by orders of magnitude from one contact to another</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical physicists have long studied systems where the variable of interest spans many orders of magnitude, the classic example is the relaxation times of glassy materials, which are often found to follow power laws. A power-law dependence has been found for the probability of transmission of COVID-19, as a function of length of time a susceptible person is in contact with an infected person. This is in data from the United Kingdom's COVID-19 app. The amount of virus in infected people spans many orders of magnitude. Inspired by this I assume that the power-law behaviour found in COVID-19 transmission, is due to the effective transmission rate varying over orders of magnitude from one contact to another. I then use a model from statistical physics to estimate that if a population all wear FFP2/N95 masks, this reduces the effective reproduction number for COVID-19 transmission by a factor of approximately nine.</description>

      <title>Ionic association and Wien effect in 2D confined electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances in nanofluidics have allowed to explore ion transport across molecular-scale pores, in particular for iontronic applications. Two dimensional nanochannels - in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls - constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional $d$-wave ($j=2$) superconducting state may result from Cooper pairing in channels with different angular momenta and spin, such as $(l=0, s=2)$ or $(l=2, s=0)$. We consider spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions in the limit of small spin-orbit coupling parameter and with weak attractive interactions in both of these channels, and demonstrate that the stable $d$-wave phase of the system below critical temperature depends on the ratio of two interactions in such a way that all three of the cyclic, ferromagnetic, and real phases are realized when a weak inversion-breaking term is included.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation theorems and the measurement of the Onsager coefficients for two-phase flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new methodology for the experimental measurement of the Onsager coefficients of porous media flows by application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The experimental setup consists of a steady-state flow condition in which two incompressible fluids are simultaneously injected into a modified Hele-Shaw cell. The cell is transparent and allows direct visualization of the dynamics via regular optical imaging methods. The fluctuations in the phase saturations are obtained and, by computing the temporal correlations of their time derivatives, we gain access to the Onsager coefficients. This work gives experimental grounding to recent theoretical development on the applications of the fluctuation-dissipation theorems to porous media flows.</description>

      <title>Mean Back Relaxation for Position and Densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlation functions are a standard tool for analyzing statistical particle trajectories. Recently, a so called mean back relaxation (MBR) has been introduced, which correlates positions at three time points. The deviation of its long time value from $\frac{1}{2}$ has been shown to be a marker for breakage of time reversal symmetry for confined particles. Here, we extend the analysis of MBR in several ways, including discussion of a cut off length used when evaluating MBR from trajectory data. Using a path integral approach, we provide a general expression for MBR in terms of multipoint density correlations. For Gaussian systems, this expression yields a relation between MBR and mean squared displacement. We finally demonstrate that MBR can be applied to other stochastic observables besides particle position. Using it for microscopic densities, its deviation from $\frac{1}{2}$ is a marker for broken detailed balance in confinement or in bulk systems.</description>

Abstract: The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary MPS calculation.</description>

      <title>Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-N\'eel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p&lt;4$, only bound states with $n&gt;p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in symmetric zero-range process below and at critical density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing current fluctuations in a steady state is of fundamental interest and has attracted considerable attention in the recent past. However, the bulk of the studies are limited to systems that either do not exhibit a phase transition or are far from criticality. Here we consider a symmetric zero-range process on a ring that is known to show a phase transition in the steady state. We analytically calculate two density-dependent transport coefficients, namely, the bulk-diffusion coefficient and the particle mobility, that characterize the first two cumulants of the time-integrated current. We show that on the hydrodynamic scale, away from the critical point, the variance of the time-integrated current in the steady state grows with time $t$ as $\sqrt{t}$ and $t$ at short and long times, respectively. Moreover, we find an expression of the full scaling function for the variance of the time-integrated current and thereby the amplitude of the temporal growth of the current fluctuations. At the critical point, using a scaling theory, we find that, while the above-mentioned long-time scaling of the variance of the cumulative current continues to hold, the short-time behavior is anomalous in that the growth exponent is larger than one-half and varies continuously with the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuation Theorem for Arbitrary Measurement and Feedback Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems and the second law of thermodynamics are powerful relations constraining the behavior of out-of-equilibrium systems. While there exist generalizations of these relations to feedback controlled quantum systems, their applicability is limited, in particular when considering strong and continuous measurements. In this letter, we overcome this shortcoming by deriving a novel fluctuation theorem, and the associated second law of information thermodynamics, which remain applicable in arbitrary feedback control scenarios. In our second law, the entropy production is bounded by the coarse-grained entropy production which is inferrable from the measurement outcomes, an experimentally accessible quantity that does not diverge even under strong continuous measurements. We illustrate our results by a qubit undergoing discrete and continuous measurement, where our approach provides a useful bound on the entropy production for all measurement strengths.</description>

      <title>Utilizing entropy to systematically quantify the resting-condition baroreflex regulation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baroreflex is critical to maintain the blood pressure homeostasis, and the quantification of the baroreflex regulation function (BRF) can provide guidance for disease diagnosis, treatment and healthcare. Current quantification of the BRF such as baroreflex sensitivity cannot represent the BRF systematically. From the perspective of complex systems, we regard that the BRF is the emergence result of the diverse states and interactions in the physiological mechanisms. Therefore, the three-layer emergence is constructed in this work, which is from the physiological mechanisms to the physiological indexes and then to the BRF. On this basis, since the entropy in statistical physics macroscopically measures the diversity of the system's states, a new index called the PhysioEnt is proposed to represent the BRF and quantify the physical relationships between the BRF and four physiological indexes, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate, heart rate variability, and systolic blood pressure. Based on the proposed method, some new findings with medical significance are obtained, including the mechanisms that aging and obesity affect the resting-condition BRF are different, and the resting-condition BRFs of men and older people depend more on the physiological processes among organs/tissues. Based on the measurable indexes, the proposed method would support the individualized medicine prospectively.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

      <title>A Universal Model of Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic specific entropy on the transition line near the QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) critical point on the isentropic trajectories in the QCD phase diagram. We point out that the universality of the critical equation of state and the third law of thermodynamics require the specific entropy (per baryon) along the coexistence (first-order transition) line to be nonmonotonic at least on one side of that line. Specifically, a maximum must occur. We show how the location of the maximum relative to the QCD critical point depends on the parameters of the critical equation of state commonly used in the literature. We then examine how the isentropic trajectories followed by adiabatically expanding heavy-ion collision fireballs behave near the critical point. We find that a crucial role is played by the sign of the isochoric temperature derivative of pressure at the critical point; this sign determines on which side of the coexistence curve the specific entropy must be nonmonotonic (i.e., has a maximum). We classify different scenarios of the adiabatic expansion that arise depending on the value of the discriminant parameter and the proximity of the trajectory to the critical point.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading of Conditional Mutual Information in Noisy Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of conditional mutual information in generic open quantum systems, focusing on one-dimensional random circuits with interspersed local noise. Unlike in noiseless circuits, where conditional mutual information spreads linearly while being bounded by the lightcone, we find that noisy random circuits with an error rate $p$ exhibit superlinear propagation of conditional mutual information, which diverges far beyond the lightcone at a critical circuit depth $t_c \propto p^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the underlying mechanism for such rapid spreading is the combined effect of local noise and a scrambling unitary, which selectively removes short-range correlations while preserving long-range correlations. To analytically capture the dynamics of conditional mutual information in noisy random circuits, we introduce a coarse-graining method, and we validate our theoretical results through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we identify a universal scaling law governing the spreading of conditional mutual information.</description>

      <title>Ramp from Replica Trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the spectral form factor of the modular Hamiltonian $K=-\ln\rho_A$ associated to the reduced density matrix of a Haar random state. A ramp is demonstrated and we find an analytic expression for its slope. Our method involves an application of the replica trick, where we first calculate the correlator $&lt;\text{tr}\rho_A^n\;\text{tr}\rho_A^m&gt;$ at large bond dimension and then analytically continue the indices $n,m$ from integers to arbitrary complex numbers. We use steepest descent methods at large modular times to extract the ramp. The large bond dimension limit of the replicated partition function is dominated by a sum over \emph{annular non-crossing permutations}. We explored the similarity between our results and calculations of the spectral form factor in low dimensional gravitational theories where the ramp is determined by the double trumpet geometry. We find there is an underlying resemblance in the two calculations, when we interpret the annular non-crossing permutations as representing a discretized version of the double trumpet. Similar results are found for an equilibrated pure state in place of the Haar random state.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in conformal field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>
