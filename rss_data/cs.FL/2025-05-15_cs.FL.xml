      <title>Deconstructing Subset Construction -- Reducing While Determinizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the NFA canonization problem, which introduces intermediate minimization steps to reduce the exploration space on-the-fly. Essential to our approach are so-called equivalence registries which manage information about equivalent states and allow for incorporating further optimization techniques such as convexity closures or simulation to boost performance. Due to the generality of our approach, these concepts can be embedded in classic subset construction or Brzozowski's approach. We evaluate our approach on a set of real-world examples from automatic sequences and observe that we are able to improve especially worst-case scenarios. We implement our approach in an open-source library for users to experiment with.</description>

      <title>B\"uchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot Theorem for Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore languages of higher-dimensional automata (HDAs) from an algebraic and logical point of view. Such languages are sets of finite width-bounded interval pomsets with interfaces (ipomsets) closed under order extension. We show that ipomsets can be represented as equivalence classes of words over a particular alphabet, called step sequences. We introduce an automaton model that recognize such languages. Doing so allows us to lift the classical B\"uchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot Theorem to languages of HDAs: we prove that a set of interval ipomsets is the language of an HDA if and only if it is simultaneously MSO-definable, of bounded width, and closed under order refinement.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Decidability of FC-Definable Regular Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FC is a first-order logic that reasons over all factors of a finite word using concatenation, and can define non-regular languages like that of all squares (ww). In this paper, we establish that there are regular languages that are not FC-definable. Moreover, we give a decidable characterization of the FC-definable regular languages in terms of algebra, automata, and regular expressions. The latter of which is natural and concise: Star-free generalized regular expressions extended with the Kleene star of terminal words.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Bisimulation for Parameterized Anonymity and Uniformity Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bisimulation is crucial for verifying process equivalence in probabilistic systems. This paper presents a novel logical framework for analyzing bisimulation in probabilistic parameterized systems, namely, infinite families of finite-state probabilistic systems. Our framework is built upon the first-order theory of regular structures, which provides a decidable logic for reasoning about these systems. We show that essential properties like anonymity and uniformity can be encoded and verified within this framework in a manner aligning with the principles of deductive software verification, where systems, properties, and proofs are expressed in a unified decidable logic. By integrating language inference techniques, we achieve full automation in synthesizing candidate bisimulation proofs for anonymity and uniformity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by addressing several challenging examples, including cryptographic protocols and randomized algorithms that were previously beyond the reach of fully automated methods.</description>

      <title>An algebraic theory of {\omega}-regular languages, via {\mu}{\nu}-expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternating parity automata (APAs) provide a robust formalism for modelling infinite behaviours and play a central role in formal verification. Despite their widespread use, the algebraic theory underlying APAs has remained largely unexplored. In recent work, a notation for non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) was introduced, along with a sound and complete axiomatisation of their equational theory via right-linear algebras. In this paper, we extend that line of work, in particular to the setting of infinite words. We present a dualised syntax, yielding a notation for APAs based on right-linear lattice expressions, and provide a natural axiomatisation of their equational theory with respect to the standard language model of {\omega}-regular languages. The design of this axiomatisation is guided by the theory of fixed point logics; in fact, the completeness factors cleanly through the completeness of the linear-time {\mu}-calculus.</description>

      <title>Polyregular Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a high-level language with Python-like syntax for string-to-string, polyregular, first-order definable transductions. This language features function calls, boolean variables, and nested for-loops. We devise and implement a complete decision procedure for the verification of such programs against a first-order specification. The decision procedure reduces the verification problem to the decidable first-order theory of finite words (extensively studied in automata theory), which we discharge using either complete tools specific to this theory (MONA), or to general-purpose SMT solvers (Z3, CVC5).</description>

      <title>Transcendence for Pisot Morphic Words over an Algebraic Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that for a uniform morphic sequence
  $\boldsymbol u = \langle u_n\rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ and an algebraic
  number $\beta$ such that $|\beta|&gt;1$, the number
  $[\![\boldsymbol{u} ]\!]_\beta:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty
  \frac{u_n}{\beta^n}$ either lies in $\mathbb Q(\beta)$ or is
  transcendental. In this paper we show a similar
  rational-transcendental dichotomy for sequences defined by
  irreducible Pisot morphisms. Subject to the Pisot conjecture (an
  irreducible Pisot morphism has pure discrete spectrum), we
  generalise the latter result to arbitrary finite alphabets. In
  certain cases we are able to show transcendence of
  $[\![\boldsymbol{u}]\!]_{\beta}$ outright. In particular, for
  $k\geq 2$, if $\boldsymbol u$ is the $k$-bonacci word then
  $[\![\boldsymbol{u}]\!]_{\beta}$ is transcendental.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C}: Oper \to Cat$, which we call the \emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>
