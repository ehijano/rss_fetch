      <title>Makeenko-Migdal equations for 2D Yang-Mills: from lattice to continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the convergence of the discrete Makeenko-Migdal equations for the Yang-Mills model on $(\varepsilon \mathbf{Z})^{2}$ to their continuum counterparts on the plane, in an appropriate sense. The key step in the proof is identifying the limits of the contributions from deformations as the area derivatives of the Wilson loop expectations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the variance of both smooth linear statistics and rough linear statistics (counting statistics) of random normal matrices. The two classical ensembles of random matrices, the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) and the complex Ginibre ensemble, enjoy an exact map to the ground state of noninteracting Fermions in a harmonic trap in one, respectively two dimensions. Both feature that the variance of the number of Fermions (the number variance) in a set $A$, and the respective entanglement entropy are proportional. For the Ginibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial symmetric sets $A$, and we prove it in generality for subsets $A$ of the bulk, thus establishing a holographic principle. Moreover, for generic random normal matrix ensembles depending on some potential $V$, not necessarily exhibiting radial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is proportional to the circumference of $A$, $\sim\sqrt{n}|\partial A|$. A special focus is on the variance of linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, which interpolates between the GUE and Ginibre ensemble, in various regimes of non-Hermiticity, where we enlarge the concept of weak non-Hermiticity to mesoscopic scales. Within the elliptic Ginibre ensemble we prove that for smooth test functions $f$ its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble. The interpolation depends on two positive parameters, the rescaling $\alpha$ of the weak non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau=1-\kappa n^{-\alpha}$, and the rescaling $\gamma$ of the test function $f(n^\gamma z)$, for a continuous range of values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. In the mesoscopic regime and when $\alpha=\gamma&lt;1$, we prove an interpolating central limit theorem with an adaptation of the method of Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Topological junctions for one-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study and classify the emergence of protected edge modes at the junction of one-dimensional materials. Using symmetries of Lagrangian planes in boundary symplectic spaces, we present a novel proof of the periodic table of topological insulators in one dimension. We show that edge modes necessarily arise at the junction of two materials having different topological indices. Our approach provides a systematic framework for understanding symmetry-protected modes in one-dimension. It does not rely on periodic nor ergodicity and covers a wide range of operators which includes both continuous and discrete models.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Schr\"odinger operators with point interactions on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, with homogeneous Robin or Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$ and a point (zero-range) interaction placed at an interior point of $\Omega$. We show that, under suitable spectral assumptions, and by means of an extension-restriction procedure which exploit the already known result on the entire space, the singular interaction is approximated by rescaled sequences of regular potentials. The result is missing in the literature, and we also take the opportunity to point out some general issues in the approximation of point interactions and the role of zero energy resonances.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Bounds for Multi-Particle Reduced Density Matrices of Coulombic Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For bound states of atoms and molecules of $N$ electrons we consider the corresponding $K$-particle reduced density matrices, $\Gamma^{(K)}$, for $1 \le K \le N-1$. Previously, eigenvalue bounds were obtained in the case of $K=1$ and $K=N-1$ by A.V. Sobolev. The purpose of the current work is to obtain bounds in the case of $2 \le K \le N-2$. For such $K$ we label the eigenvalues of the positive, trace class operators $\Gamma^{(K)}$ by $\lambda_n(\Gamma^{(K)})$ for $n=1,2,\dots$, and obtain the bounds $\lambda_n(\Gamma^{(K)}) \le Cn^{-\alpha_K}$ for all $n$, where $\alpha_K = 1 + 7/(3L)$ and $L = \min\{K,N-K\}$.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between quantum error correcting codes and quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a gauge theory, a collection of kinematical degrees of freedom is used to redundantly describe a smaller amount of gauge-invariant information. In a quantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of freedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a smaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this clear parallel in terms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for quantization in the presence of symmetries. The result is a precise dictionary between QECCs and QRFs within the perspective-neutral framework for constrained systems. Concepts from quantum error correction like error sets and correctability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture of gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure for constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting properties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli stabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups, which possess symmetry groups that are isomorphic to the stabilizer group. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor factorizations splitting system from frame degrees of freedom, relative to which errors corrupt only redundant frame data. When passed through the dictionary, standard Pauli errors from the code essentially behave as electric excitations that are exactly dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic excitations related to gauge-fixing. We comprehensively illustrate our findings in surface codes, which themselves manifestly connect quantum error correction with gauge systems. The exploratory investigations in this article pave the way for deeper foundational applications to quantum gauge theories and for eventual practical applications to quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</description>

      <title>Dihedral beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a group theory-based formulation that introduces new classes of dihedral-symmetric beams is presented. Our framework leverages the algebraic properties of the dihedral group of rotations and reflections to transform input beams into closed-form families of dihedral-invariant wavefields, which will be referred to as dihedral beams. Each transformation is associated with a specific dihedral group in such a way that each family of dihedral beams exhibits the symmetries of its corresponding group. Our approach is inspired by one of the outcomes of this work: elegant Hermite-Gauss beams can be described as a dihedral interference pattern of elegant traveling waves, a new set of solutions to the paraxial equation also developed in this paper. Particularly, when taking elegant traveling waves as input beams, they transform into elegant dihedral beams possessing quasi-crystalline properties and including features like phase singularities, self-healing, and pseudo-nondiffracting propagation, as well as containing elegant Hermite and Laguerre-Gauss beams as special cases. Our approach can be applied to arbitrary scalar and vector input beams and constitutes a general group-theory formulation that can be extended beyond the dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Parametric reflection maps: an algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions of the parametric set-theoretic reflection equation from an algebraic perspective by employing recently derived generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks, called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. Generic invertible solutions of the set-theoretic reflection equation are also obtained by a suitable parametric twist. The twist leads to considerably simplified constraints compared to the ones obtained from general set-theoretic reflections. In this context, novel algebraic structures of (skew) p-braces that generalize the known (skew) braces and are suitable for the parametric Yang-Baxter equation are introduced. The p-rack Yang-Baxter and reflection operators as well as the associated algebraic structures are defined setting up the frame for formulating the p-rack reflection algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle in the wrong box (or: the perils of finite-dimensional approximations)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When numerically simulating the unitary time evolution of an infinite-dimensional quantum system, one is usually led to treat the Hamiltonian $H$ as an ''infinite-dimensional matrix'' by expressing it in some orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, and then truncate it to some finite dimensions. However, the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equations generated by the truncated Hamiltonians need not converge, in general, to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the actual Hamiltonian.
  In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian which crucially depends on the particular choice of basis: the Friedrichs extension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations of elements of the basis. Importantly, this is generally different from $H$ itself; in all such cases, numerical simulations will unavoidably reproduce the wrong dynamics in the limit, and yet there is no numerical test that can reveal this failure, unless one has the analytical solution to compare with.
  As a practical demonstration of such results, we consider the quantum particle in the box, and we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include associated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated by the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to the one corresponding to the particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, regardless the initial choice of boundary conditions. Other such examples are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent literature, various authors have studied spectral comparison results for Schr\"odinger operators with discrete spectrum in different settings including Euclidean domains and quantum graphs. In this note we derive such spectral comparison results in a rather general framework for general and possibly infinite discrete graphs. Along the way, we establish a discrete version of the local Weyl law whose proof does neither involve any Tauberian theorem nor the Weyl law as used in the continuous case.</description>

      <title>Ti and Spi, Carrollian extended boundaries at timelike and spatial infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a definition for a notion of extended boundary at time and space-like infinity which, following Figueroa-O'Farril--Have--Prohazka--Salzer, we refer to as Ti and Spi. This definition applies to asymptotically flat spacetime in the sense of Ashtekar--Romano and we wish to demonstrate, by example, its pertinence in a number of situations. The definition is invariant, is constructed solely from the asymptotic data of the metric and is such that automorphisms of the extended boundaries are canonically identified with asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, scattering data for massive fields are realised as functions on Ti and a geometric identification of cuts of Ti with points of Minkowksi then produces an integral formula of Kirchhoff type. Finally, Ti and Spi are both naturally equipped with (strong) Carrollian geometries which, under mild assumptions, enable to reduce the symmetry group down to the BMS group, or to Poincar\'e in the flat case. In particular, Strominger's matching conditions are naturally realised by restricting to Carrollian geometries compatible with a discrete symmetry of Spi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the kinetic wave equation, or phonon Boltzmann equation, set on the torus (physical system set on the lattice). We describe entropy maximizers for fixed mass and energy; our framework is very general, being valid in any dimension, for any dispersion relation, and even including the quantum kinetic wave equation. Of particular interest is the presence of condensation in certain regimes which we characterize.</description>

      <title>Full S-matrices and Witten diagrams with (relative) L-infinity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $L_\infty$-algebra approach to scattering amplitudes elegantly describes the nontrivial part of the $S$-matrix but fails to take into account the trivial part. We argue that the trivial contribution to the $S$-matrix should be accounted for by another, complementary $L_\infty$-algebra, such that a perturbative field theory is described by a cyclic relative $L_\infty$-algebra. We further demonstrate that this construction reproduces Witten diagrams that arise in AdS/CFT including, in particular, the trivial Witten diagrams corresponding to CFT two-point functions. We also discuss Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory on manifolds with boundaries using this approach.</description>

Abstract: The boundary structure of $3+1$-dimensional gravity (in the Palatini-Cartan formalism) coupled to to gauge (Yang-Mills) and matter (scalar and spinorial) fields is described through the use of the Kijowski-Tulczijew construction. In particular, the reduced phase space is obtained as the reduction of a symplectic space by some first class constraints and a cohomological description (BFV) of it is presented.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics</description>

      <title>Fluid dynamics duality and solution of decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a duality in the dynamics of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluids in three dimensions, leading to a reformulation of the problem as a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{Importantly, the momentum loop equation does not admit finite-time blow-up solutions.}
  The phenomenon of decaying turbulence emerges as a solution to this equation and can be interpreted as a string theory with a discrete target space composed of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom along their edges. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, which corresponds to a quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial, calculable background.
  As a result, the spectrum of decay exponents is derived analytically and exhibits excellent agreement with both experimental data and numerical simulations. Notably, the spectrum includes complex conjugate pairs of exponents associated with the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The classical Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by specific functions derived from number theory, exhibiting nonlinear behavior in log-log scale.
  In particular, we compare the theoretically predicted effective exponent for the second moment of the velocity difference with new DNS results. This comparison reveals a remarkable agreement, with deviations well within the small DNS error margin over a broad range of the scaling variable $r/\sqrt{t}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry and which treats position, momentum and time coordinates of a finite-dimensional integrable hierarchy on an equal footing. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation (encoding integrability). We argue that any Lagrangian one-form for a finite-dimensional system can be recast in our new framework. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a variational principle.</description>

      <title>The heat flow conjecture for polynomials and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the roots of a polynomial of degree $N$, when the polynomial itself is evolving according to the heat flow. We propose a general conjecture for the large-$N$ limit of this evolution. Specifically, we propose (1) that the log potential of the limiting root distribution should evolve according to a certain first-order, nonlinear PDE, and (2) that the limiting root distribution at a general time should be the push-forward of the initial distribution under a certain explicit transport map. These results should hold for sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.
  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a random matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem for the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix models. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is supported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect to time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE perspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE satisfied by the log potential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally converges to the desired PDE as $N\rightarrow \infty.$ We also present a "multiplicative" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.
  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the holomorphic moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise plays a pivotal role in understanding quantum transport phenomena, including current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this domain is $\Delta_T$ noise, which arises due to a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. This paper investigates $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions with insulators, where the average charge current is zero at zero voltage bias, through the measurement of quantum shot noise, i.e., $\Delta_T$ noise. Notably, we find that the $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor junctions is significantly larger than in metal-insulator-metal junctions. Furthermore, our results reveal that $\Delta_T$ noise initially increases with barrier strength, peaks, and then decreases, while it shows a steady increase with temperature bias, highlighting the nuanced interplay between barrier characteristics and thermal gradients.</description>

Abstract: The closure of a Diximier sheet is the image of a generalized Grothendieck's simultaneous resolution. We show that the associated variety of simple affine vertex algebras is contained in the closure of the Diximier sheet when a chiralization of generalized Grothendieck's simultaneous resolution exists. This generalizes in a conceptual manner the results obtained by the first named author and Anne Moreau and, in particular, allows to extend them to the types A_2, C_n, E_6, E_7.</description>

Abstract: Smooth modules for affine Kac-Moody algebras have a prime importance for the quantum field theory as they correspond to the representations of the universal affine vertex algebras. But, very little is known about such modules beyond the category of positive energy representations. We construct a new class of smooth modules over affine Kac-Moody algebras. In a particular case, these modules are isomorphic to those induced from generalized Whittaker modules for Takiff Lie algebras. We establish the irreducibility criterion for constructed modules in the case of the affine sl(2) Lie algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work deals with quantum transport in open quantum graphs. We consider the case of complete graphs on $n$ vertices with an edge removed and attached to two leads, to represent the entrance and exit channels, from where we calculate the transmission coefficient. We include the possibility of several vertices being connected or not and associate it with a randomization parameter $p$. To implement the calculation, we had to introduce the transmission coefficient of randomized quantum graphs (RQG), and we also proposed a procedure to obtain the exact and approximate but reliable results for such transmission coefficients. The main results show that the transport is importantly affected by the removal of connections between pairs of vertices, but they also indicate the presence of a region where the transmission is fully suppressed, even when the number of edge removal is not too small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist several good reasons why one may wish to add a total derivative to an interaction in quantum field theory, e.g., in order to improve the perturbative construction. Unlike in classical field theory, adding derivatives in general changes the theory. The analysis whether and how this can be prevented, is presently limited to perturbative orders $g^n$ , $n \leq 3$. We drastically simplify it by an all-orders formula, which also allows to answer some salient structural questions. The method is part of a larger program to (re)derive interactions of particles by quantum consistency conditions, rather than a classical principle of gauge invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in asymptotically flat spacetimes have a natural geometric interpretation on twistor space in terms of Poisson diffeomorphisms. Using this framework, we provide a first-principle derivation of the canonical generators associated with these symmetries starting from the Poisson BF twistor action for self-dual gravity. We express these charges as surface integrals over the celestial sphere in terms of spacetime data at null infinity. The connection between twistor space and spacetime expressions at $\mathscr{I}$ is achieved via an integral formula for the asymptotic Bianchi identities due to Bramson and Tod. Finally, we clarify how $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations are symmetries of gravity from a phase space perspective by showing the invariance of the asymptotic Bianchi identities.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>

Abstract: We analytically determine the large central charge asymptotic expansion of the Virasoro conformal blocks entering in four-point functions with external degenerate operators on a sphere in $2d$ CFTs, and study its resurgence properties as a function of the conformal cross-ratio $z$. We focus on the cases of four heavy $(2,1)$ degenerate operators, and two $(2,1)$ heavy degenerate ones plus two arbitrary light operators. The $1/c$ asymptotic series is Borel summable for generic values of $z$, but it jumps when a Stokes line is crossed. Starting from the $1/c$ series of the identity block, we show how a resurgent analysis allows us to completely determine the other Virasoro block and in fact to reconstruct the full correlator. We also show that forbidden singularities, known to exist in correlators with two heavy and two light operators, appear with four heavy operators as well. In both cases, they are turning points emanating Stokes lines, artefacts of the asymptotic expansion, and we show how they are non perturbatively resolved. More general correlators and implications for gravitational theories in $\text{AdS}_{3}$ are briefly discussed. Our results are based on new asymptotic expansions for large parameters $(a,b,c)$ of certain hypergeometric functions $\,_2 F_1(a,b,c;z)$ which can be useful in general.</description>

      <title>A purely geometrical Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply covariant affine integral quantization to study motion in the 2D punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), representing transformations of the plane composed of translations, rotations, and dilations. Near the punctured point, we observe that the topology influencing quantum fluctuations gives rise to an affine vector potential, which can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge potential generated by an infinite coil. This finding suggests that the AB effect originates from the topology enforced by the impenetrable coil, rather than from a classical gauge potential. Our results offer a novel perspective on the AB effect, emphasizing the fundamental role of topology in quantum mechanics.</description>
