      <title>The Pass-through of Retail Crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that retailers increase prices in response to organized retail crime, revealing a substantial aspect of retail crime's social costs. We match detailed information on store-level crimes to administrative scanner data from the universe of transactions for cannabis retailers in Washington state. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation from the timing of store-level robberies and burglaries, we find that crimes cause a 1.8% increase in retail prices at victimized stores. Nearby rivals of victimized stores increase prices by a similar amount with a two-month lag. Retailers' price responses are not driven by demand effects, increased wholesale costs, or strategic price responses. Instead, they are consistent with precautionary security expenditures. We find the largest pass-through rates for independent stores and in less concentrated markets. We estimate that crime imposes a 1% "hidden" unit tax on affected stores, implying an annual negative welfare effect of approximately $30.6 million, with consumers bearing two-thirds of this burden.</description>

      <title>Mapping Local Green Hydrogen Cost-Potentials by a Multidisciplinary Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fast-tracking climate change response, green hydrogen is key for achieving greenhouse gas neutral energy systems. Especially Sub-Saharan Africa can benefit from it enabling an increased access to clean energy through utilizing its beneficial conditions for renewable energies. However, developing green hydrogen strategies for Sub-Saharan Africa requires highly detailed and consistent information ranging from technical, environmental, economic, and social dimensions, which is currently lacking in literature. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive novel approach embedding the required range of disciplines to analyze green hydrogen cost-potentials in Sub-Saharan Africa. This approach stretches from a dedicated land eligibility based on local preferences, a location specific renewable energy simulation, locally derived sustainable groundwater limitations under climate change, an optimization of local hydrogen energy systems, and a socio-economic indicator-based impact analysis. The capability of the approach is shown for case study regions in Sub-Saharan Africa highlighting the need for a unified, interdisciplinary approach.</description>

      <title>The role of green ammonia in meeting challenges towards a sustainable development in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the adoption of a green ammonia economy in meeting challenges in China's sustainable development. First, key challenges in China's energy transition, industry decarbonziation and regional sustainable development are explored. The coal-dominated energy consumption has placed great obstacles in achieving energy transition and led to massive CO2 emission since the large-scale industrialization. The high dependency on oil and gas import has threatened the energy security. A DEA model is applied for obtaining green total factor productivities of China's six administrative regions, with which, imbalanced and unsustainable regional development is identified. Second, the role of green ammonia in meeting the sustainability challenges is analysed. Ammonia is examined to be a flexible and economic option for large-scale hydrogen transport and storage. Co-firing ammonia in coal power generation at 3% rate is evaluated as an option for achieving low-carbon transition by 2030. The adoption of a green ammonia economy in China is discussed from energy, environmental and economic aspects. The practice can decline fossil energy consumption, enhance energy security, and facilitate renewable energy delivery and storage, industry decarbonization, and regional development. We assume the findings and results contribute to addressing sustainability challenges and realizing a hydrogen economy in China.</description>

      <title>The heterogeneous impact of the EU-Canada agreement with causal machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a causal machine learning approach to investigate the impact of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). We propose a matrix completion algorithm on French customs data to obtain multidimensional counterfactuals at the firm, product and destination levels. We find a small but significant positive impact on average at the product-level intensive margin. On the other hand, the extensive margin shows product churning due to the treaty beyond regular entry-exit dynamics: one product in eight that was not previously exported substitutes almost as many that are no longer exported. When we delve into the heterogeneity, we find that the effects of the treaty are higher for products at a comparative advantage. Focusing on multiproduct firms, we find that they adjust their portfolio in Canada by reallocating towards their first and most exported product due to increasing local market competition after trade liberalization. Finally, multidimensional counterfactuals allow us to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of the CETA. Specifically, we observe trade diversion, as exports to other destinations are re-directed to Canada.</description>

      <title>Consumption Partial Insurance in the Presence of Tail Income Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the extent of consumption insurance to income shocks accounting for high-order moments of the income distribution. We derive a nonlinear consumption function, in which the extent of insurance varies with the sign and magnitude of income shocks. Using PSID data, we estimate an asymmetric pass-through of bad versus good permanent shocks -- 17% of a 3 sigma negative shock transmits to consumption compared to 9% of an equal-sized positive shock -- and the pass-through increases as the shock worsens. We find similar patterns for transitory shocks among the least wealthy. Households are willing to sacrifice more than 1/8 of lifetime consumption to eliminate tail income risk. Our results are consistent with surveys of consumption responses to hypothetical events and suggest that tail risk matters substantially for consumption.</description>
