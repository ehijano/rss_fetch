      <title>Negative feedback and oscillations in a model for mRNA translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ribosome flow model (RFM) is a phenomenological model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a 1D chain of $n$ sites. The RFM has been extensively used to study the dynamics of ribosome flow along a single mRNA molecule during translation. In this case, the particles model ribosomes and each site corresponds to a consecutive group of codons. Networks of interconnected RFMs have been used to model and analyze large-scale translation in the cell and, in particular, the effects of competition for shared resources. Here, we analyze the RFM with a negative feedback connection from the protein production rate to the initiation rate. This models, for example, the production of proteins that inhibit the translation of their own mRNA. Using tools from the theory of 2-cooperative dynamical systems, we provide a simple condition guaranteeing that the closed-loop system admits at least one non-trivial periodic solution. When this condition holds, we also explicitly characterize a large set of initial conditions such that any solution emanating from this set converges to a non-trivial periodic solution. Such a solution corresponds to a periodic pattern of ribosome densities along the mRNA, and to a periodic pattern of protein production.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods for Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12610</link>

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning techniques including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN inference are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Constrained Learning of Dynamics from Static Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics.\\ Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</description>
