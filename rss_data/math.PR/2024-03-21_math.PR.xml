      <title>Can a rudderless species survive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some species of salmon and sea turtle are famously good at finding their birth place to reproduce after having travelled vast expanses of ocean. In contrast, imagine now a species (maybe ancestral to the salmon or turtle) which has to find its birth place to reproduce but has no navigation skills and relies on chance alone. Would such an imaginary species survive? According to our (very simple) model it would survive if and only if the probability that a given individual find its birth place is strictly larger than 1/2.</description>

      <title>Multidisperse Random Sequential Adsorption and Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified study of the limiting density in one-dimensional random sequential adsorption (RSA) processes where segment lengths are drawn from a given distribution. In addition to generic bounds, we are also able to characterize specific cases, including multidisperse RSA, in which we draw from a finite set of lengths, and power-law RSA, in which we draw lengths from a power-law distribution.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the fourth-moment phenomenon of monochromatic subgraph counts via influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of monochromatic subgraph counts in random vertex $2$-colorings of large graphs. We give sufficient conditions for the asymptotic normality of these counts and demonstrate their essential necessity (particularly for monochromatic triangles). Our approach refines the fourth-moment theorem to establish new, local influence-based conditions for asymptotic normality; these findings more generally provide insight into fourth-moment phenomena for a broader class of Rademacher and Gaussian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Moderate Deviation and Berry-Esseen Bounds in the $p$-Spin Curie-Weiss Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limit theorems for the magnetization in the $p$-spin Curie-Weiss model, for $p \geq 3$, has been derived recently by Mukherjee et al. (2021). In this paper, we strengthen these results by proving Cram\'er-type moderate deviation theorems and Berry-Esseen bounds for the magnetization (suitably centered and scaled). In particular, we show that the rate of convergence is $O(N^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ when the magnetization has asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations, and it is $O(N^{-\frac{1}{4}})$ when the fluctuations are non-Gaussian. As an application, we derive a Berry-Esseen bound for the maximum pseudolikelihood estimate of the inverse temperature in $p$-spin Curie-Weiss model with no external field, for all points in the parameter space where consistent estimation is possible.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Volterra processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of continuous polynomial Volterra processes, which we define as solutions to stochastic Volterra equations driven by a continuous semimartingale with affine drift and quadratic diffusion matrix in the state of the Volterra process. To demonstrate the versatility of possible state spaces within our framework, we construct polynomial Volterra processes on the unit ball. This construction is based on a stochastic invariance principle for stochastic Volterra equations with possibly singular kernels. Similarly to classical polynomial processes, polynomial Volterra processes allow for tractable expressions of the moments in terms of the unique solution to a system of deterministic integral equations, which reduce to a system of ODEs in the classical case. By applying this observation to the moments of the finite-dimensional distributions we derive a uniqueness result for polynomial Volterra processes. Moreover, we prove that the moments are polynomials with respect to the initial condition, another crucial property shared by classical polynomial processes. The corresponding coefficients can be interpreted as a deterministic dual process and solve integral equations dual to those verified by the moments themselves. Additionally, we obtain a representation of the moments in terms of a pure jump process with killing, which corresponds to another non-deterministic dual process.</description>

      <title>Large and moderate deviations in Poisson navigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive large- and moderate-deviation results in random networks given as planar directed navigations on homogeneous Poisson point processes. In this non-Markovian routing scheme, starting from the origin, at each consecutive step a Poisson point is joined by an edge to its nearest Poisson point to the right within a cone. We establish precise exponential rates of decay for the probability that the vertical displacement of the random path is unexpectedly large. The proofs rest on controlling the dependencies of the individual steps and the randomness in the horizonal displacement as well as renewal-process arguments.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for stochastic differential equations driven by stochastic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for stochastic differential equations driven by stochastic integrals in one dimension. The result can be proved with a minimal use of rough path theory, and this implies the LDP for many class of rough volatility models, and it characterizes the asymptotic behavior of implied volatility. First, we introduce a new concept called $\alpha$-Uniformly Exponentially Tightness, and prove the LDP for stochastic integrals on H\"{o}lder spaces. Second, we apply this type of LDP to deduce the LDP for stochastic differential equations driven by stochastic integrals in one dimension.</description>

      <title>New bounds for normal approximation on product spaces with applications to monochromatic edges, random sums and an infinite de Jong CLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Malliavin theory for $L^2$-functionals on product probability spaces that has recently been developed by Decreusefond and Halconruy (2019) and by Duerinckx (2021), by characterizing the domains and investigating the actions of the three Malliavin operators in terms of the infinite Hoeffding decomposition in $L^2$, which we identify as the natural analogue of the famous Wiener-It\^{o} chaos decomposition on Gaussian and Poisson spaces. We further combine this theory with Stein's method for normal approximation in order to provide three different types of abstract Berry-Esseen and Wasserstein bounds: a) Malliavin-Stein bounds involving the Malliavin gradient $D$ and the pseudo-inverse of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck generator $L$, b) bounds featuring the carr\'{e}-du-champ operator $\Gamma$ and c) bounds making use of a Clark-Ocone type integration-by-parts formula. To demonstrate the flexibility of these abstract bounds, we derive quantitative central limit theorems for the number of monochromatic edges in a uniform random coloring of a graph sequence as well as for random sums and prove an infinite version of the quantitative de Jong CLT that has recently been proved by G. Peccati and the author (2017) and by the author (2023). As a further theoretical application, we deduce new abstract Berry-Esseen and Wasserstein bounds for functionals of a general independent Rademacher sequence.</description>

      <title>Analysing heavy-tail properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent by means of Stochastic Recurrence Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent works on the theory of machine learning, it has been observed that heavy tail properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can be studied in the probabilistic framework of stochastic recursions. In particular, G\"{u}rb\"{u}zbalaban et al. (arXiv:2006.04740) considered a setup corresponding to linear regression for which iterations of SGD can be modelled by a multivariate affine stochastic recursion $X_k=A_k X_{k-1}+B_k$, for independent and identically distributed pairs $(A_k, B_k)$, where $A_k$ is a random symmetric matrix and $B_k$ is a random vector. In this work, we will answer several open questions of the quoted paper and extend their results by applying the theory of irreducible-proximal (i-p) matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper to introduce a new model of evolvement of narratives (common opinions, information bubble) on networks. Our main tools come from invariant mean theory and graph theory. The case, when the root set of the network (influencers, news agencies, etc.) is ergodic is fully discussed. The other possibility, when the root contains more than one component is partially discussed and it could be a motivation for further research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Risk-Sensitive Scheduling Policies for Remote Estimation of Autoregressive Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design scheduling policies that minimize a risk-sensitive cost criterion for a remote estimation setup. Since risk-sensitive cost objective takes into account not just the mean value of the cost, but also higher order moments of its probability distribution, the resulting policy is robust to changes in the underlying system's parameters. The setup consists of a sensor that observes a discrete-time autoregressive Markov process, and at each time $t$ decides whether or not to transmit its observations to a remote estimator using an unreliable wireless communication channel after encoding these observations into data packets. We model the communication channel as a Gilbert-Elliott channel \cite{10384144}. Sensor probes the channel \cite{laourine2010betting} and hence knows the channel state at each time $t$ before making scheduling decision. The scheduler has to minimize the expected value of the exponential of the finite horizon cumulative cost that is sum of the following two quantities (i) the cumulative transmission power consumed, (ii) the cumulative squared estimator error. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the system state at time $t$ is composed of (i) the instantaneous error $\Delta(t):= x(t)-a\hat{x}(t-1)$, where $x(t),\hat{x}(t-1)$ are the system state and the estimate at time $t,t-1$ respectively, and (ii) the channel state $c(t)$. We show that there exists an optimal policy that has a threshold structure, i.e., at each time $t$, for each possible channel state $c$, there is a threshold $\D\ust(c)$ such that if the current channel state is $c$, then it transmits only when the error $\D(t)$ exceeds $\D\ust(c)$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Lattice Schr\"{o}dinger-Type Operators Associated with the Nonstationary Anderson Model and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research explores a high irregularity, commonly referred to as intermittency, of the solution to the non-stationary parabolic Anderson problem: \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \varkappa \mathcal{L}u(t,x) + \xi_{t}(x)u(t,x) \end{equation*} with the initial condition \(u(0,x) \equiv 1\), where \((t,x) \in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{Z}^d\). Here, \(\varkappa \mathcal{L}\) denotes a non-local Laplacian, and \(\xi_{t}(x)\) is a correlated white noise potential. The observed irregularity is intricately linked to the upper part of the spectrum of the multiparticle Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the moment functions \(m_p(t,x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_p) = \langle u(t,x_1)u(t,x_2)\cdots u(t,x_p)\rangle\).
  In the first half of the paper, a weak form of intermittency is expressed through moment functions of order $p\geq 3$ and established for a wide class of operators $\varkappa \mathcal{L}$ with a positive-definite correlator $B=B(x))$ of the white noise. In the second half of the paper, the strong intermittency is studied. It relates to the existence of a positive eigenvalue for the lattice Schr\"odinger type operator with the potential $B$. This operator is associated with the second moment $m_2$. Now $B$ is not necessarily positive-definite, but $\sum B(x)\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in random networks of identical phase oscillators: A graphon approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators have been used to model circadian rhythms, flashing fireflies, Josephson junction arrays, high-voltage electric grids, and many other kinds of self-organizing systems. Recently, several authors have sought to understand how coupled oscillators behave when they interact according to a random graph. Here we consider interaction networks generated by a graphon model known as a $W$-random network, and examine the dynamics of an infinite number of identical phase oscillators, following an approach pioneered by Medvedev. We show that with sufficient regularity on $W$, the solution to the dynamical system over a $W$-random network of size $n$ converges in the $L^{\infty}$ norm to the solution of the continuous graphon system, with high probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$. This result suggests a framework for studying synchronization properties in large but finite random networks. In this paper, we leverage our convergence result in the $L^{\infty}$ norm to prove synchronization results for two classes of identical phase oscillators on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. First, we show that the Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G(n, \alpha_n)$ achieves phase synchronization with high probability as $n$ goes to infinity, if the edge probability $\alpha_n$ exceeds $(\log n)/n$, the connectivity threshold of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Then we show that the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G(n, p)$ achieves frequency synchronization with high probability as $n$ goes to infinity, assuming a fixed edge probability $p\in(0,1]$ and a certain regime for the model's phase shift parameter. A notable feature of the latter result is that it holds for an oscillator model whose dynamics are not simply given by a gradient flow.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Uplink-Downlink Networked Control Systems with Energy Harvesting Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a wireless networked control system (WNCS) consisting of a plant, a battery-operated sensor, a controller, and an actuator. The battery in the sensor harvests energy from the environment. The sensor then uses this energy for packet transmissions. There are two types of wireless communication channels, (i) sensor--controller channel (also called uplink channel), and (ii) controller--actuator channel (also called downlink channel). The controller is \emph{half-duplex}, and this prevents it from simultaneously receiving an update from the sensor, and also transmitting a control packet to the actuator. Though frequent transmissions via uplink channel improve controller's estimate of the plant state, but this also reduces the timely control of the plant. Hence, in order to strike a balance between these two, we consider the problem of designing an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the expected cumulative infinite horizon discounted cost, where the instantaneous cost is equal to the square of the plant state. At each time $t$, the scheduler at the sensor has to decide whether it should activate the uplink channel, or downlink. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the state at time $t$ is composed of (i) the plant state $x(t)$, (ii) the age of the data packet available at the controller, denoted by $\tau(t)$, (iii) a binary variable $y(t)$ which indicates the availability of a control packet at the controller, and (iv) the energy level of the battery at the sensor $b(t)$. We show that there exists an optimal scheduling policy that exhibits a threshold structure, meaning that for each time $t$, if there is a control packet available with the controller, then the sensor activates the downlink channel in case $|x(t)|$ exceeds a threshold $x\ust(\tau(t),b(t))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of infinite horizon fully coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We propose a generalized monotonicity condition involving two flexible functions. Under this condition, we establish the well-posedness results for infinite horizon McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs by the method of continuation, including the unique solvability, an estimate of the solution, and the related continuous dependence property of the solution on the coefficients. Based on the solvability result, we study an infinite horizon mean field control problem. Moreover, by choosing appropriate form of the flexible functions, we can eliminate the different phenomenon between the linear-quadratic (LQ) problems on infinite horizon and finite horizon proposed in Wei and Yu (SIAM J. Control Optim. 59: 2594-2623, 2021).</description>

      <title>Instance-dependent uniform tail bounds for empirical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10053v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a uniform tail bound for empirical processes indexed by a class of functions, in terms of the individual deviations of the functions rather than the worst-case deviation in the considered class. The tail bound is established by introducing an initial "deflation" step to the standard generic chaining argument. The resulting tail bound is the sum of the complexity of the "deflated function class" in terms of a generalization of Talagrand's $\gamma$ functional, and the deviation of the function instance, both of which are formulated based on the natural seminorm induced by the corresponding Cram\'{e}r functions. We also provide certain approximations for the mentioned seminorm when the function class lies in a given (exponential type) Orlicz space, that can be used to make the complexity term and the deviation term more explicit.</description>

      <title>Replica-mean-field limit of continuous-time fragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many phenomena can be modeled as network dynamics with punctuate interactions. However, most relevant dynamics do not allow for computational tractability. To circumvent this difficulty, the Poisson Hypothesis regime replaces interaction times between nodes by independent Poisson processes, allowing for tractability in several cases, such as intensity-based models from computational neuroscience. This hypothesis is usually only conjectured, or numerically validated. In this work, we introduce a class of processes in continuous time called continuous fragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes, by analogy with previously introduced processes in discrete time. The state of each node, described by the stochastic intensity of an associated point process, aggregates arrivals from its neighbors and is fragmented upon departure. We consider the replica-mean-field version of such a process, which is a physical system consisting of randomly interacting copies of the network of interest. Generalizing results proved in discrete time and in the particular case of excitatory intensity-based neural dynamics, we prove that the Poisson Hypothesis holds at the limit of an infinite number of replicas.</description>

      <title>The friendship paradox for sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ be an undirected finite graph on $n\in\mathbb{N}$ vertices labelled by $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$. For $i \in [n]$, let $\Delta_{i,n}$ be the friendship bias of vertex $i$, defined as the difference between the average degree of the neighbours of vertex $i$ and the degree of vertex $i$ itself when $i$ is not isolated, and zero when $i$ is isolated. Let $\mu_n$ denote the friendship-bias empirical distribution, i.e., the measure that puts mass $\frac{1}{n}$ at each $\Delta_{i,n}$, $i \in [n]$. The friendship paradox says that if $G_n$ has no self-loops, then $\int_{\mathbb{R}} x\mu_n(\mathrm{d}x) \geq 0$, with equality if and only if in each connected component of $G_n$ all the degrees are the same.
  We show that if $(G_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of sparse random graphs that converges to a rooted random tree in the sense of convergence locally in probability, then $\mu_n$ converges weakly to a limiting measure $\mu$ that is expressible in terms of the law of the rooted random tree. We study $\mu$ for four classes of sparse random graphs: the homogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the configuration model and the preferential attachment model. In particular, we compute the first two moments of $\mu$, identify the right tail of $\mu$, and argue that $\mu([0,\infty))\geq\tfrac{1}{2}$, a property we refer to as friendship-paradox significance.</description>

      <title>Almost sure and moment convergence for triangular P\'olya urns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider triangular P\'olya urns and show under very weak conditions a general strong limit theorem of the form $X_{ni}/a_{ni}\to \mathcal{X}_i$ a.s., where $X_{ni}$ is the number of balls of colour $i$ after $n$ draws; the constants $a_{ni}$ are explicit and of the form $n^\alpha\log^\gamma n$; the limit is a.s. positive, and may be either deterministic or random, but is in general unknown.
  The result extends to urns with subtractions under weak conditions, but a counterexample shows that some conditions are needed.
  For balanced urns we also prove moment convergence in the main results if the replacements have the corresponding moments.
  The proofs are based on studying the corresponding continuous-time urn using martingale methods, and showing corresponding results there. We assume for convenience that all replacements have finite second moments.</description>

      <title>Study of measure-valued Markov processes. Explicit bounds for the convergence in distribution of mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to prove that the rates of convergence in distribution for $N$-particle mean-field models are the expected one: $N^{-1}$ in Law of Large Numbers regime, and $N^{-1/2}$ in Central Limit Theorem regime. These proofs require to study empirical measures of McKean-Vlasov particle systems, and conditional laws of McKean-Vlasov processes, as measure-valued Markov processes. In particular, the expressions of the infinitesimal generators of such processes are established for measure-valued processes with general jumps. The generators being differential operators, all the proofs rely on the analytical properties of measure-variable functions, and the differentiation of such functions.</description>

      <title>Neural Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Maximum Mean Discrepancies with Riesz Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals with non-smooth Riesz kernels show a rich structure as singular measures can become absolutely continuous ones and conversely. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of such flows. We propose to approximate the backward scheme of Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto for computing such Wasserstein gradient flows as well as a forward scheme for so-called Wasserstein steepest descent flows by neural networks (NNs). Since we cannot restrict ourselves to absolutely continuous measures, we have to deal with transport plans and velocity plans instead of usual transport maps and velocity fields. Indeed, we approximate the disintegration of both plans by generative NNs which are learned with respect to appropriate loss functions. In order to evaluate the quality of both neural schemes, we benchmark them on the interaction energy. Here we provide analytic formulas for Wasserstein schemes starting at a Dirac measure and show their convergence as the time step size tends to zero. Finally, we illustrate our neural MMD flows by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Consecutive Pattern Containment and c-Wilf Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive linear recurrences for avoiding non-overlapping consecutive patterns in both permutations and words and identify a necessary condition for establishing c-Wilf-equivalence between two non-overlapping patterns. Furthermore, we offer alternative, elementary proofs for several known results in consecutive pattern containment that were previously demonstrated using ideas from cluster algebra and analytical combinatorics. Lastly, we establish new general bounds on the growth rates of consecutive pattern avoidance in permutations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Empirical Optimal Transport in Unbounded Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In compact settings, the convergence rate of the empirical optimal transport cost to its population value is well understood for a wide class of spaces and cost functions. In unbounded settings, however, hitherto available results require strong assumptions on the ground costs and the concentration of the involved measures. In this work, we pursue a decomposition-based approach to generalize the convergence rates found in compact spaces to unbounded settings under generic moment assumptions that are sharp up to an arbitrarily small $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Hallmark properties of empirical optimal transport on compact spaces, like the recently established adaptation to lower complexity, are shown to carry over to the unbounded case.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic statistical test of the diffusion coefficient of stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop several statistical tests of the determinant of the diffusion coefficient of a stochastic differential equation, based on discrete observations on a time interval $[0,T]$ sampled with a time step $\Delta$. Our main contribution is to control the test Type I and Type II errors in a non asymptotic setting, i.e. when the number of observations and the time step are fixed. The test statistics are calculated from the process increments. In dimension 1, the density of the test statistic is explicit. In dimension 2, the test statistic has no explicit density but upper and lower bounds are proved. We also propose a multiple testing procedure in dimension greater than 2. Every test is proved to be of a given non-asymptotic level and separability conditions to control their power are also provided. A numerical study illustrates the properties of the tests for stochastic processes with known or estimated drifts.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling Based on Gradient Flows of the MMD with Negative Distance Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose conditional flows of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with the negative distance kernel for posterior sampling and conditional generative modeling. This MMD, which is also known as energy distance, has several advantageous properties like efficient computation via slicing and sorting. We approximate the joint distribution of the ground truth and the observations using discrete Wasserstein gradient flows and establish an error bound for the posterior distributions. Further, we prove that our particle flow is indeed a Wasserstein gradient flow of an appropriate functional. The power of our method is demonstrated by numerical examples including conditional image generation and inverse problems like superresolution, inpainting and computed tomography in low-dose and limited-angle settings.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Property B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If an $n$-uniform hypergraph can be 2-colored, then it is said to have property B. Erd\H{o}s (1963) was the first to give lower and upper bounds for the minimal size $m(n)$ of an $n$-uniform hypergraph without property B. His asymptotic upper bound $O(n^22^n)$ still is the best we know, his lower bound $2^{n-1}$ has seen a number of improvements, with the current best $\Omega$ $(2^n\sqrt{n/\log(n)})$ established by Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan (2000). Cherkashin and Kozik (2014) provided a simplified proof of this result, using Pluh\'ar's (2009) idea of a random greedy coloring. In the present paper, we use a refined version of this argument to obtain improved lower bounds on $m(n)$ for small values of $n$. We also study $m(n,v)$, the size of the smallest $n$-hypergraph without property B having $v$ vertices.</description>
