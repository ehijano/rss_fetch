      <title>Kicking Co and Rh atoms on a row-wise antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion on surfaces is a fundamental process in surface science, governing nanostructure and film growth, molecular self-assembly, and chemical reactions. Atom motion on non-magnetic surfaces has been studied extensively both theoretically and by real-space imaging techniques. For magnetic surfaces density functional theory (DFT) calculations have predicted strong effects of the magnetic state onto adatom diffusion, but to date no corresponding experimental data exists. Here, we investigate Co and Rh atoms on a hexagonal magnetic layer, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and DFT calculations. Experimentally, we "kick" atoms by local voltage pulses and thereby initiate strictly one-dimensional motion which is dictated by the row-wise antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Our calculations show that the one-dimensional motion of Co and Rh atoms results from conserving the Co spin direction during movement and avoiding high induced Rh spin moments, respectively. These findings demonstrate that magnetism can be a means to control adatom mobility.</description>

      <title>Metal Assisted Chemical Etching patterns at a Ge/Cr/Au interface modulated by the Euler instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solid state system which spontaneously generates remarkable engraving patterns on the surface of Ge. The layered construction, with a metal film on the Ge surface, results in coupling of the metal catalyzed etching reaction with the long range stress field at the Ge - metal interface. The etching patterns generated have similarities with Turing patterns, hydrodynamic patterns, crack propagation, and biological form. We describe spirals, radial patterns, and more disordered structures. Euler buckling of the metal layer generates a characteristic wavelength for some patterns.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of anatase-to-columbite TiO2 phase transformation via sheared phases: first-principles calculations and high-pressure torsion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-pressure torsion (HPT) can facilitate phase transformations in titanium dioxide (TiO2) and stabilize its high-pressure columbite phase, as an active photocatalyst, by shear straining under high pressure. This study aims to understand the mechanism underlying the acceleration of the anatase-to-columbite phase transformation by shear strain. A mechanism by considering sheared crystal structures as intermediate phases was proposed and examined using quantum mechanics in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and HPT experiments. DFT energy and phonon calculations demonstrated the viability of the sheared structures as intermediate phases. Furthermore, the sheared structures were observed experimentally as new metastable phases using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. These findings can explain the significant effect of shear strain on pressure-induced phase transitions, reported during severe plastic deformation of various metals and ceramics.</description>

      <title>Double-sided van der Waals epitaxy of topological insulators across an atomically thin membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) films provide a novel material platform for epitaxial growth of quantum heterostructures. However, unlike the remote epitaxial growth of three-dimensional bulk crystals, the growth of two-dimensional (2D) material heterostructures across atomic layers has been limited due to the weak vdW interaction. Here, we report the double-sided epitaxy of vdW layered materials through atomic membranes. We grow vdW topological insulators (TIs) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy on both surfaces of atomically thin graphene or hBN, which serve as suspended 2D vdW "$\textit{substrate}$" layers. Both homo- and hetero- double-sided vdW TI tunnel junctions are fabricated, with the atomically thin hBN acting as a crystal-momentum-conserving tunnelling barrier with abrupt and epitaxial interface. By performing field-angle dependent magneto-tunnelling spectroscopy on these devices, we reveal the energy-momentum-spin resonant tunnelling of massless Dirac electrons between helical Landau levels developed in the topological surface states at the interface.</description>

      <title>Large low-field magnetocaloric response in a ferromagnetic gadolinium orthophosphate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk magnetic and thermodynamic measurements, along with mean-field calculations, were conducted on the ferromagnetic K3Gd5(PO4)6 powders. No magnetic ordering was observed until 2 K, while the application of an external field B &gt; 1 T resulted in the splitting of the Gd3+ ground state multiplet and induced a non-cooperative Schottky effect. The average nearest-neighbor exchange strength |J1/kB| is determined to be 0.017 K, which leads to a remarkably large low field magnetic entropy change {\Delta}Sm = 36.2 J kg-1 K-1 under applied field change B = 2 T at temperature T = 2 K, as well as a maximum adiabatic temperature change Tad = 10.9 K. We contend that ferromagnetic gadolinium orthophosphates serve as a promising reservoir for exploring advanced magnetic refrigerants applicable under low magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Role of Stacking Faults in TlGaSe$_{2}$ on its Thermoelectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials are of great interest for heat energy harvesting applications. One such promising material is TlGaSe$_{2}$, a p-type semiconducting ternary chalcogenide. Recent reports show it can be processed as a thin film, opening the door for large-scale commercialization. However, TlGaSe$_{2}$ is prone to stacking faults along the [001] stacking direction and their role in its thermoelectric properties has not been understood to date. Herein, TlGaSe$_{2}$ is investigated via (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. Stacking faults are found to be present throughout the material, as density functional theory calculations reveal a lack of preferential stacking order. Electron transport calculations show an enhancement of thermoelectric power factors when stacking faults are present. This implies the presence of stacking faults is key to the material's excellent thermoelectric properties along the [001] stacking direction, which can be further enhanced by doping the material to hole carrier concentrations to approx. 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of crystal-field, Zeeman splitting, and spin-phonon excitations in the quantum supersolid Na2BaCo(PO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the recent breakthroughs in the \ce{Na_{2}BaCo(PO_{4})_{2}} quantum magnet, renowned for its spin supersolidity phase and its potential for revolutionary cooling applications, our study delves into the intricate interplay among lattice, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom within this intriguing compound. Using meticulous temperature, field, and pressure-dependent Raman scattering techniques, we present compelling experimental evidence revealing pronounced crystal-electric field (CEF) excitations, alongside the interplay of CEF-phonon interactions. Notably, our experiments elucidate all electronic transitions from $j_{1 / 2}$ to $j_{3 / 2}$ and from $j_{1 / 2}$ to $j_{5 / 2}$, with energy level patterns closely aligned with theoretical predictions based on point-charge models. Furthermore, the application of a magnetic field and pressure reveals Zeeman splittings characterized by Land\'e-g factors as well as the CEF-phonon resonances. The anomalous shift in coupled peak at low temperatures originates from the hybridization of CEF and phonon excitations due to their close energy proximity. These findings constitute a significant step towards unraveling the fundamental properties of this exotic quantum material for future research in fundamental physics or engineering application.</description>

      <title>Understanding magnetic hyperthermia performance within the "Brezovich criterion": beyond the uniaxial anisotropy description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Careful determination of the heating performance of magnetic nanoparticles under AC fields is critical for magnetic hyperthermia applications. However, most interpretations of experimental data are based on the uniaxial anisotropy approximation, which in first instance can be correlated with particle aspect ratio. This is to say, the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy is discarded, under the assumption that the shape contribution dominates. We show in this work that such premise, generally valid for large field amplitudes, does not hold for describing hyperthermia experiments carried out under small field values. Specifically, given its relevance for \textit{in vivo} applications, we focus our analysis on the so-called "Brezovich criterion", $H\cdot{f}=4.85\cdot{10^8}A/m\cdot{s}$. By means of a computational model, we show that the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy plays a critical role in defining the heat output; otherwise, the only-uniaxial anisotropy description reports essentially negligible heat loss values. Our results call therefore for an improvement in the theoretical models used to interpret magnetic hyperthermia performance.</description>

      <title>Isotope substitution and polytype control for point defects identification: the case of the ultraviolet color center in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in crystals can have a transformative effect on the properties and functionalities of solid-state systems. Dopants in semiconductors are core components in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The control of single color centers is at the basis of advanced applications for quantum technologies. Unintentional defects can also be detrimental to the crystalline structure and hinder the development of novel materials. Whatever the research perspective, the identification of defects is a key but complicated, and often long-standing issue. Here, we present a general methodology to identify point defects by combining isotope substitution and polytype control, with a systematic comparison between experiments and first-principles calculations. We apply this methodology to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and its ubiquitous color center emitting in the ultraviolet spectral range. From isotopic purification of the host hBN matrix, a local vibrational mode of the defect is uncovered, and isotope-selective carbon doping proves that this mode belongs to a carbon-based center. Then, by varying the stacking sequence of the host hBN matrix, we unveil different optical responses to hydrostatic pressure for the non-equivalent configurations of this ultraviolet color center. We conclude that this defect is a carbon dimer in the honeycomb lattice of hBN. Our results show that tuning the stacking sequence in different polytypes of a given crystal provides unique fingerprints contributing to the identification of defects in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Coexisting charge density waves in twisted bilayer NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of two-dimensional materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform for studying broken symmetry phases. While most interest has been focused on emergent states in systems whose constituent monolayers do not feature broken symmetry states, assembling monolayers that exhibit ordered states into twisted bilayers can also give rise to interesting phenomena. Here, we use large-scale first-principles density-functional theory calculations to study the atomic structure of twisted bilayer $\mathrm{{N}b{S}e_2}$ whose constituent monolayers feature a charge density wave. We find that different charge density wave states coexist in the ground state of the twisted bilayer: monolayer-like $3\times 3$ triangular and hexagonal charge density waves are observed in low-energy stacking regions, while stripe charge density waves are found in the domain walls surrounding the low-energy stacking regions. These predictions, which can be tested by scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, highlight the potential to create complex charge density wave ground states in twisted bilayer systems and can serve as a starting point for understanding superconductivity occurring at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Atomistic spin dynamics simulations of magnonic spin Seebeck and spin Nernst effects in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon band structures in altermagnets are characterized by an energy splitting of modes with opposite chirality, even in the absence of applied external fields and relativistic effects, due to an anisotropy in the Heisenberg exchange interactions. We perform quantitative atomistic spin dynamics simulations based on ab initio electronic structure calculations on rutile RuO$_2$, a prototypical "d-wave" altermagnet, to study magnon currents generated by thermal gradients. We report substantial spin Seebeck and spin Nernst effects, i.e., longitudinal or transverse spin currents, depending on the propagation direction of the magnons with respect to the crystal, together with a finite spin accumulation associated with non-linearities in the temperature profile. Our findings are consistent with the altermagnetic spin-group symmetry, as well as predictions from linear spin wave theory and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general, systematic theory of electromagnetism and chirality in crystalline solids. Symmetry is its fundamental guiding principle. We use the formal similarity between space inversion $i$ and time inversion $\theta$ to identify two complementary, comprehensive classification of crystals, based on five categories of electric and magnetic multipole order -- called polarizations -- and five categories of chirality. The five categories of polarizations (parapolar, electropolar, magnetopolar, antimagnetopolar, and multipolar) expand the familiar notion of electric dipolarization in ferroelectrics and magnetization in ferromagnets to higher-order multipole densities. The five categories of chirality (parachiral, electrochiral, magnetochiral, antimagnetochiral, and multichiral) expand the familiar notion of enantiomorphism due to non-superposable mirror images to the inversion symmetries $i$, $\theta$, and $i\theta$. In multichiral systems, all these inversion symmetries are absent so that these systems have four distinct enantiomorphs. Each category of chirality arises from distinct superpositions of electric and magnetic multipole densities. We provide a complete theory of minimal effective models characterizing the different categories of chirality in different systems. Jointly these two schemes yield a classification of all 122 magnetic crystallographic point groups into 15 types that treat the inversion symmetries $i$, $\theta$, and $i\theta$ on the same footing. The group types are characterized via distinct physical properties and characteristic features in the electronic band structure. At the same time, the formal similarities between the inversion symmetries $i$, $\theta$, and $i\theta$ imply striking correspondences between apparently dissimilar systems and their physical properties.</description>

      <title>snompy: a package for modelling scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) is a powerful technique for extreme subwavelength imaging and spectroscopy, with around 20 nm spatial resolution. But quantitative relationships between experiment and material properties requires modelling, which can be computationally and conceptually challenging. In this work, we present snompy an open-source Python library which contains implementations of two of the most common s-SNOM models, the finite dipole model (FDM) and the point dipole model (PDM). We show a series of typical uses for this package with demonstrations including simulating nano-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and recovering permittivity from experimental s-SNOM data. We also discuss the challenges faced with this sort of modelling, such as competing descriptions of the models in literature, and finite size effects. We hope that snompy will make quantitative s-SNOM modelling more accessible to the wider research community, which will further empower the use of s-SNOM for investigating nanoscale material properties.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope with Pulse Tube and Joule-Thomson cooling operating at sub-pm z-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system that does not need any external supply of cooling liquids. It achieves temperatures down to 1.5 K and a z-noise down to 300 fmRMS for the frequency range of 0.1 Hz - 5 kHz (feedback loop off). It employs a pulse tube cryocooler (PTC) and a Joule-Thomson (JT) stage inducing only small temperature oscillations at the STM with amplitude below 1 mK. The challenge to combine an effective vibrational decoupling from the PTC with sufficient thermal conduction is tackled by a multipartite approach. We realize a minimal stiffness of the UHV bellows that connect the PTC and the STM chamber. Fine Copper wires mechanically decouple the PTC stages from cooling plates that carry the thermal shields, the JT stage and the STM. Soft springs decouple the STM from the JT stage. Finally, the STM body has an optimized conical shape and is made of the light and stiff material Shapal Hi MSoft such that a strong reduction of low frequency vibrations results for the tunnel junction. The voltage noise in the tunnel junction is 0.12 mV and an RF antenna close to the tunnel junction provides radio frequency excitations up to 40 GHz with amplitudes up to 10 mV.</description>

      <title>Solving multi-pole challenges in the GW100 benchmark enables precise low-scaling GW calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation is a widely used method for computing electron addition and removal energies of molecules and solids. The computational effort of conventional $GW$ algorithms increases as $O(N^4)$ with the system size $N$, hindering the application of $GW$ to large and complex systems. Low-scaling $GW$ algorithms are currently very actively developed. Benchmark studies at the single-shot $G_0W_0$ level indicate excellent numerical precision for frontier quasiparticle energies, with mean absolute deviations $&lt;10$ meV with respect to standard implementations for the widely used $GW100$ test set. A notable challenge for low-scaling $GW$ algorithms remains in achieving high precision for five molecules within the $GW100$ test set, namely O$_3$, BeO, MgO, BN, and CuCN, for which the deviations are in the range of several hundred meV. This is due to a spurious transfer of spectral weight from the quasiparticle to the satellite spectrum in $G_0W_0$ calculations, resulting in multi-pole features in the self-energy and spectral function, which low-scaling algorithms fail to describe. We show in this work that including eigenvalue self-consistency in the Green's function ($\text{ev}GW_0$) achieves a proper separation between satellite and quasiparticle peak, leading to a single solution of the quasiparticle equation with spectral weight close to one. $\text{ev}GW_0$ quasiparticles energies from low-scaling $GW$ closely align with reference calculations; the mean absolute error is only 12 meV for the five molecules.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid Superconductor-Semiconductor (S-Sm) materials systems are promising candidates for quantum computing applications. Their integration into superconducting electronics has enabled on-demand voltage tunability at millikelvin temperatures. Ge quantum wells (Ge QWs) have been among the semiconducting platforms interfaced with superconducting Al to realize voltage tunable Josephson junctions. Here, we explore Nb as a superconducting material in direct contact with Ge channels by focusing on the solid-state reactions at the Nb/Ge interfaces. We employ Nb evaporation at cryogenic temperatures (100 K) to establish a baseline structure with atomically and chemically abrupt Nb/Ge interfaces. By conducting systematic photoelectron spectroscopy and transport measurements on Nb/Ge samples across varying annealing temperatures, we elucidated the influence of Ge out-diffusion on the ultimate performance of superconducting electronics. This study underlines the need for low-temperature growth to minimize chemical intermixing and band bending at the Nb/Ge interfaces.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence enhancement at the vertical van der Waals semiconductor-metal heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer intriguing new possibilities for optoelectronics with no analogues in bulk semiconductors. Yet, intrinsic defects in TMDCs limit the radiative exciton recombination pathways. As a result, the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) is limited. Methods like superacid treatment, electrical doping, and plasmonic engineering can inhibit nonradiative decay channels and enhance PL. Here, we show a more straightforward approach that allows PL enhancement. An engineered vertical van der Waals (vdW) metal-monolayer semiconductor junction (MSJ) results in PL enhancement of more than an order of magnitude at technologically relevant excitation powers. Such MSJ can be constructed by vertically stacking metals with suitable work function either above or below a monolayer semiconducting TMDC. Our experiments reveal that the underlying PL enhancement mechanism is to be the suppressed exciton quenching due to the absence of metal-induced gap states and weak Fermi level pinning, thanks to the vdW gapped interface between the metal and the TMDC. Our time-resolved PL measurements further indicate that reduced exciton-exciton annihilation, even at high generation rates, contributes to the observed PL enhancement. The PL intensity is further increased by the proximity of surface plasmons in the metal with the TMDC layer. Our findings shed light on the interaction at vdW metal-semiconductor interfaces and offer a path to improving the optoelectronic performance of semiconducting TMDCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical parameter, known as a topological index, is employed to represent the molecular structure of a compound by considering its graph-theoretical properties. In the study of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), topological indices are used to predict the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds. Graph entropies have evolved as information-theoretic tools to investigate the structural information of a molecular graph. In this research work, we compute the Nirmala index, the first and second inverse Nirmala index for terpyridine complex nanosheet $TCN_{n,m}$ with the help of its M-polynomial. Further, entropy measures based on Nirmala indices are calculated for terpyridine complex nanosheets. We expand this analysis to include visual comparisons, which could be useful in refining the structure for more effective implementation. Furthermore, using graphical and numerical methods, the correlation and comparison between the Nirmala indices and the corresponding entropy measurements are shown. The relationship between the Nirmala indices and associated entropy measurements is then examined using a regression model.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional magnetic conduction channels across zigzag graphene nanoribbon/hexagonal boron nitride heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the electronic structure of recently fabricated in-plane heterojunctions of zigzag graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride. We focus on hitherto unexplored interface configurations in which both edges of the nanoribbon are bonded to the same chemical species, either boron or nitrogen atoms. Using ab initio and mean-field Hubbard model calculations, we reveal the emergence of one-dimensional magnetic conducting channels at these interfaces. These channels originate from the energy shift of the magnetic interface states that is induced by charge transfer between the nanoribbon and hexagonal boron nitride. We further address the response of these heterojunctions to external electric and magnetic fields, demonstrating the tunability of energy and spin splittings in the electronic structure. Our findings establish that zigzag graphene nanoribbon/hexagonal boron nitride heterojunctions are a suitable platform for exploring and engineering spin transport in the atomically thin limit, with potential applications in integrated spintronic devices</description>

      <title>Edible microlasers for monitoring authenticity and quality of food and pharmaceuticals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traceability, security and freshness monitoring are crucial to the food and pharmaceutical industries. Currently, barcodes and sensors are almost exclusively located on product packaging. Making them edible and introducing them into edible products could significantly enhance their functions. Here, several types of microlasers made entirely out of edible substances were developed. It is striking that olive oil already contains enough chlorophyll to be used as a laser when dispersed in water as droplets. The edible lasers can be embedded directly into edible products and serve as barcodes and sensors. Due to their much narrower spectral lines compared to fluorescent or color-changing sensors, they are significantly more sensitive to various environmental factors. The edible lasers were employed to sense sugar concentration, pH, the presence of bacteria, and exposure to too-high temperatures. They can also encode tens of data bits, such as manufacturer's information and expiration date. The microlasers are entirely safe for consumption, do not change the appearance and taste of food considerably, and are environmentally friendly. The developed barcodes and sensors could also be applied to non-edible items, such as cosmetic and agricultural products, for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>A mathematical justification for nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic framework that rigorously generates nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain for elastic bodies. Each of these relations arises as the leading order relationship satisfied by a one-parameter family of nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and nonlinear strain. The asymptotic parameter limits the overall range of strains that satisfy the corresponding constitutive relation in the one-parameter family while the stresses can remain large (relative to a fixed stress scale). This differs from classical linearized elasticity where a fixed constitutive relation is assumed, and the magnitude of the displacement gradient serves as the asymptotic parameter. Also unlike classical approaches, the constitutive relations in our framework are expressed as implicit relationships between stress and strain rather than requiring stress explicitly expressed as a function of strain, adding conceptual simplicity and versatility. We demonstrate that our framework rigorously justifies nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain including those with density-dependent Young's moduli or derived from strain energies beyond quadratic forms.</description>

Abstract: Many problems intractable on classical devices could be solved by algorithms explicitly based on quantum mechanical laws, i.e. exploiting quantum information processing. As a result, increasing efforts from different fields are nowadays directed to the actual realization of quantum devices. Here we provide an introduction to Quantum Information Processing, focusing on a promising setup for its implementation, represented by molecular spin clusters known as Molecular Nanomagnets. We introduce the basic tools to understand and design quantum algorithms, always referring to their actual realization on a molecular spin architecture. We then examine the most important sources of noise in this class of systems and then one of their most peculiar features, i.e. the possibility to exploit many (more than two) available states to encode information and to self-correct it from errors via proper design of quantum error correction codes. Finally, we present some examples of quantum algorithms proposed and implemented on a molecular spin qudit hardware.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport Properties of Ferromagnetic/Antiferromagnetic Superlattices: Probing the role of induced magnetization in antiferromagnetic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic and transport properties of the $La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}$ (LSMO)/$Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3}$ (PCMO) like ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic superlattices in three dimensions using a two orbitals double exchange model incorporating the Jahn-Teller lattice distortions, superexchange interactions and long-range Coulomb interactions. In our simulations we primarily focus on periodic arrangement of $w_L$ planes of ferromagnetic LSMO and $w_P$ planes of antiferromagnetic PCMO manganites, and set $w_L$+$w_P$ = 10. The induced ferromagnetic correlations in the parent PCMO layer decreases monotonically with increasing the PCMO layer width $w_P$ at high temperatures for both half-doping ($n =0.5$) and off-half-doping ($n = 0.55$) scenarios. As we decrease the temperature further the induced ferromagnetic moments in PCMO layer disappears or decreases considerably at half-doping due to the onset of charge ordering in antiferromagnetic PCMO layers. Overall, the magnetization in PCMO layer decreases at low temperatures and the metal-insulator transition temperature of the LSMO/PCMO superlattices increases with increase of the PCMO layer width $w_P$, similar to the experiments. On the other hand, at off-half-doping, the induced ferromagnetic moment survives even at low temperatures due to weakened charge ordering in PCMO layer and interestingly, varies nonmonotonically with PCMO layer width, in agreement with experiments. The nonmonotonic trend of the conductivity of the superlattice with increase of the PCMO layer width $w_P$ shows an one-to-one correspondence between conductivity of the superlattice and the induced ferromagnetic moments in the PCMO layer. We highlight the key role of induced ferromagnetic moment in PCMO layer in analyzing the magnetotransport properties of the LSMO/PCMO superlattices.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Charge Transfer in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a charge transfer mechanism in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) quantum dots (QDs) is studied. A common dye, Rhodamine 6G (R6G), has been used as fluorescent molecule and QDs of molybdenum disulfide ($\rm{MoS_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\rm{WS_2}$) have been used as acceptors of electrons in the photo-induced charge transfer process. The MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs have been synthesized using ultrasonication method. These QDs have been characterized using transmission electron microscope (TEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and fluorimeter. The TEM images of these QDs show well dispersed particles of size $~$2 nm. These QDs show intense fluorescence emission when excited with light having wavelength, $\lambda &lt; $ 350 nm. In presence of light, the photons help in creating charges in fluorescent dye molecule, and TMDCs QDs felicitate the charge transfer in the process. The charge transfer phenomenon has been studied using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) set-up, which is a time resolved fluorescence spectroscopic technique. The time resolved fluorescence study shows a drastic change in the fluorescence (FL) lifetime of R6G molecules in the presence of QDs. This decrease in FL lifetime of R6G shows that the MoS$_2$, and WS$_2$ QDs provide additional path to the photo-generated electrons in the excited state of R6G. This study can be further extended to optoelectronic devices, where charge transfer plays an important role in the device efficiency and performance.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional electron liquids (2DELs) have increasing technological relevance for ultrafast electronics and spintronics, yet significant gaps in their fundamental understanding are exemplified on the prototypical SrTiO$_3$. We correlate the exact SrTiO$_3$(001) surface structure with distinct 2DELs through combined microscopic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy on truly bulk-terminated surfaces that alleviate structural uncertainties inherent to this long-studied system. The SrO termination is shown to develop a 2DEL following the creation of oxygen vacancies, unlike the intrinsically metallic TiO$_2$ termination. Differences in degeneracy of the 2DELs, that share the same band filling and identical band bending, are assigned to polar distortions of the Ti atoms in combination with spin order, supported with the extraction of fundamental electron-phonon coupling strength. These results not only resolve the ambiguities regarding 2DELs on SrTiO$_3$ thus far, but also pave the way to manipulating band filling and spin order in oxide 2DELs in general.</description>

      <title>Stacking-engineered ferroelectricity and multiferroic order in van der Waals magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit spontaneous magnetization, polarization or strain (referred to as ferroics) have the potential to revolutionize nanotechnology by enhancing the multifunctionality of nanoscale devices. However, multiferroic order is difficult to achieve, requiring complicated coupling between electron and spin degrees of freedom. We propose a universal method to engineer multiferroics from van der Waals magnets by taking advantage of the fact that changing the stacking between 2D layers can break inversion symmetry, resulting in ferroelectricity and possibly magnetoelectric coupling. We illustrate this concept using first-principles calculations in bilayer NiI$_2$, which can be made ferroelectric upon rotating two adjacent layers by $180^{\circ}$ with respect to the bulk stacking. Furthermore, we discover a novel multiferroic order induced by interlayer charge transfer which couples the interlayer spin order and electronic polarization. Our approach is not only general but also systematic, and can enable the discovery of a wide variety of 2D multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Emergent flat band and topological Kondo semimetal driven by orbital-selective correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands are expected to show proportionally enhanced electron correlations, which may generate a plethora of novel quantum phases and unusual low-energy excitations. They are increasingly being pursued in $d$-electron-based systems with crystalline lattices that feature destructive electronic interference, where they are often topological. Such flat bands, though, are generically located far away from the Fermi energy, which limits their capacity to partake in the low-energy physics. Here we show that electron correlations produce emergent flat bands that are pinned to the Fermi energy. We demonstrate this effect within a Hubbard model, in the regime described by Wannier orbitals where an effective Kondo description arises through orbital-selective Mott correlations. Moreover, the correlation effect cooperates with symmetry constraints to produce a topological Kondo semimetal. Our results motivate a novel design principle for Weyl Kondo semimetals in a new setting, viz. $d$-electron-based materials on suitable crystal lattices, and uncover interconnections among seemingly disparate systems that may inspire fresh understandings and realizations of correlated topological effects in quantum materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced insulator-to-metal transition in few-layer FePS$_3$ at 1.5 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials the application of pressure often induces a giant lattice collapse, which can subsequently drive an associated Mott transition. Here, we investigate room-temperature layer-dependent insulator-metal transition (IMT) and probable spin-crossover (SCO) in vdW magnet, FePS$_3$, under high-pressure using micro-Raman scattering. Experimentally obtained spectra, in agreement with the computed Raman modes, indicate evidence of IMT of FePS$_3$ started with a thickness-dependent critical pressure ($P_c$) which reduces to 1.5 GPa in trilayer flakes compared to 10.8 GPa for the bulk counterpart. Using a phenomenological model, we argue that strong structural anisotropy in few-layer flakes enhances the in-plane strain under applied pressure and is, therefore, ultimately responsible for reducing the critical pressure for the IMT with decreasing layer numbers. Reduction of the critical pressure for phase transition in vdW magnets to 1-2 GPa marks the possibility of using intercalated few-layers in the field-effect transistor device architecture, and thereby, avoiding the conventional use of the diamond anvil cell (DAC).</description>

      <title>Origin of spin-driven ferroelectricity and effect of external pressure on the complex magnetism of 6H-perovskite Ba3HoRu2O9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The compound Ba3HoRu2O9 magnetically orders at 50 K (TN1) followed by another complex magnetic ordering at 10.2 K (TN2). The 2nd magnetic phase transition was characterized by the co-existence of two competing magnetic ground states associated with two different magnetic wave vectors (K1=1/2 0 0 and K2=1/4 1/4 0). Here, we have discussed the origin of spin-driven ferroelectricity, which is not known yet. We demonstrate through time-of-flight Neutron diffraction and theoretical calculation that the non-collinear structure involving two different magnetic ions, Ru(4d) and Ho(4f), break the spatial inversion symmetry via inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) interaction through strong 4d-4f magnetic correlation, which shifts the oxygen atoms and results in non-zero polarization. Such an observation of inverse D-M interaction from two different magnetic ions which caused ferroelectricity is rarely observed. We have systematically studied the spin and dipolar dynamics, which exhibit intriguing behavior with shorter coherence lengths of 2nd magnetic phase associated with the k2-wave vector. The results manifest the development of finite-size magnetoelectric domains instead of true long-range ordering which justifies the experimentally obtained low value of ferroelectric polarization. The synchrotron XRD analysis predicts a non-centrosymmetric space group P-62c. Furthermore, we have investigated the effect of external pressure on this complex magnetism. The result reveals an enhancement of ordering temperature by the application of external pressure (1.6 K/GPa). The external pressure might favor stabilizing the magnetic ground state associated with 2nd magnetic phase. Our study shows an unconventional mechanism of spin-driven ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Robust Experimental Signatures of Phase Transitions in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is widely considered to be a promising candidate for a quantum-classical algorithm which could achieve near-term quantum advantage. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>3-center and 4-center 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals on modern accelerated processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) algorithm for 3-center and 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian atomic orbitals (AOs) with low and high angular momenta $l$ and varying degrees of contraction for graphical processing units (GPUs). This work builds upon our recent implementation of a matrix form of the MD algorithm that is efficient for GPU evaluation of 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian AOs of high angular momenta ($l\geq 4$) [$\mathit{J. Phys. Chem. A}\ \mathbf{127}$, 10889 (2023)]. The use of unconventional data layouts and three variants of the MD algorithm allow to evaluate integrals in double precision with sustained performance between 25% and 70% of the theoretical hardware peak. Performance assessment includes integrals over AOs with $l\leq 6$ (higher $l$ is supported). Preliminary implementation of the Hartree-Fock exchange operator is presented and assessed for computations with up to quadruple-zeta basis and more than 20,000 AOs. The corresponding C++ code is a part of the experimental open-source $\mathtt{LibintX}$ library available at $\mathbf{github.com:ValeevGroup/LibintX}$.</description>

      <title>Effects of alloying elements on carbon diffusion in the austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TThe effects of alloying elements on diffusion pathways and migration energies of interstitial carbon in austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) are studied using density functional theory first-principles calculations. The binding energies between carbon and alloying elements are determined through 6th nearest-neighbor (NN) distances. The elements studied are Ni, Mo, V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Al, Ti, and Si, relevant to most high-strength steels. Nickel, Mn, Al, and Si have repulsive binding energies; Mo, V, Cr, Cu, and Ti have attractive binding energies in austenite and ferrite. Alloying elements at 1st NN sites of a C atom in an octahedral site introduce asymmetry into the minimum energy diffusion pathway, causing up to about 1 eV changes in saddle-point energies. This pathway goes from one octahedral site to another via intermediate energy states, differing for austenite and ferrite. We find that the elements with attractive binding energies increase the energy barrier for C migration resulting in decelerated carbon diffusion, while the elements with repulsive binding energies decrease the energy barrier for C migration leading to accelerated C diffusion. The magnitude of changes in C migration energies is proportional to the binding energies between C and alloying elements. Among the three austenite stabilizers, Ni and Mn are C diffusion accelerators, while Cu decelerates C diffusion in austenite. Among the four ferrite stabilizers, Si is a C diffusion accelerator, while V and Ti serve as C diffusion decelerators in ferrite. Aluminum has no significant effect on C's diffusivity, while Mo and Cr decelerate C diffusion.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
