      <title>One task to rule them all: A closer look at traffic classification generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing website fingerprinting and traffic classification solutions do not work well when the evaluation context changes, as their performances often heavily rely on context-specific assumptions. To clarify this problem, we take three prior solutions presented for different but similar traffic classification and website fingerprinting tasks, and apply each solution's model to another solution's dataset. We pinpoint dataset-specific and model-specific properties that lead each of them to overperform in their specific evaluation context.
  As a realistic evaluation context that takes practical labeling constraints into account, we design an evaluation framework using two recent real-world TLS traffic datasets from large-scale networks. The framework simulates a futuristic scenario in which SNIs are hidden in some networks but not in others, and the classifier's goal is to predict destination services in one network's traffic, having been trained on a labelled dataset collected from a different network. Our framework has the distinction of including real-world distribution shift, while excluding concept drift. We show that, even when abundant labeled data is available, the best solutions' performances under distribution shift are between 30% and 40%, and a simple 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier's performance is not far behind. We depict all performances measured on different models, not just the best ones, for a fair representation of traffic models in practice.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Aided eVTOL Delay Sensitive Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rapid urbanization and increasing population density, urban traffic congestion has become a critical issue, and traditional ground transportation methods are no longer sufficient to address it effectively. To tackle this challenge, the concept of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) has emerged, aiming to utilize low-altitude airspace to establish a three-dimensional transportation system. Among various components of the AAM system, electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft plays a pivotal role due to their flexibility and efficiency. However, the immaturity of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) technologies poses significant challenges to safety-critical AAM operations. Specifically, existing Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM)-based eVTOL systems lack rigorous mathematical frameworks to quantify probabilistic delay bounds under dynamic air traffic patterns, a prerequisite for collision avoidance and airspace management. To bridge this gap, we employ network calculus tools to derive the probabilistic upper bound on communication delay in the AAM system for the first time. Furthermore, we formulate a complex non-convex optimization problem that jointly minimizes the probabilistic delay bound and the propagation delay. To solve this problem efficiently, we propose a solution based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm and Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) method. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how various factors impact regret and transmission rate, and explore the influence of varying load intensity and total delay on the probabilistic delay bound.</description>

      <title>Beyond Connectivity: An Open Architecture for AI-RAN Convergence in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications at the network edge demands a fundamental shift in RAN design, from merely consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI workloads. This paradigm shift presents a significant opportunity for network operators to monetize AI at the edge while leveraging existing infrastructure investments. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The proposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to be orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch processing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the orchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor interoperability.</description>

      <title>Learning To Communicate Over An Unknown Shared Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robots (edge-devices, agents) find uses in an increasing number of settings and edge-cloud resources become pervasive, wireless networks will often be shared by flows of data traffic that result from communication between agents and corresponding edge-cloud. In such settings, agent communicating with the edge-cloud is unaware of state of network resource, which evolves in response to not just agent's own communication at any given time but also to communication by other agents, which stays unknown to the agent. We address challenge of an agent learning a policy that allows it to decide whether or not to communicate with its cloud node, using limited feedback it obtains from its own attempts to communicate, to optimize its utility. The policy generalizes well to any number of other agents sharing the network and must not be trained for any particular network configuration. Our proposed policy is a DRL model Query Net (QNet) that we train using a proposed simulation-to-real framework. Our simulation model has just one parameter and is agnostic to specific configurations of any wireless network. It allows training an agent's policy over a wide range of outcomes that an agent's communication with its edge-cloud node may face when using a shared network, by suitably randomizing the simulation parameter. We propose a learning algorithm that addresses challenges observed in training QNet. We validate our simulation-to-real driven approach through experiments conducted on real wireless networks including WiFi and cellular. We compare QNet with other policies to demonstrate its efficacy. WiFi experiments involved as few as five agents, resulting in barely any contention for the network, to as many as fifty agents, resulting in severe contention. The cellular experiments spanned a broad range of network conditions, with baseline RTT ranging from a low of 0.07 second to a high of 0.83 second.</description>

      <title>SlimCaching: Edge Caching of Mixture-of-Experts for Distributed Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input. However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy, we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee. For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective. To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference latency compared to existing baselines.</description>

Abstract: Internet has significantly improved the quality of citizens across the world. Though the internet coverage is quite high, 40% of global population do not have access to broadband internet. This paper presents an analysis of a field survey of population in some areas of Kathmandu, Nepal, an emerging economy. This survey was triggered by intermittent severe congestion of internet in certain areas of the city. People from three different areas were asked about their present experience of internet usage, its impact on their lives and their aspirations for the future. Survey pointed to high speed, low cost, reliable and secure internet as a major aspiration of the respondents. Based on their inputs, this paper presents a sentiment analysis as well as demographic information. Keys insights from this analysis shows that overall sentiment to most queries are positive. The variances of positive sentiments are high whereas those for negative ones are low. Also, some correlations and clusters are observed among the attributes though no dominant component exists in the data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cognitive Networks: Reinforcement Learning Meets Energy Harvesting Over Cascaded Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to improve the physical layer security (PLS) of an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) over cascaded channels. These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks such as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims to intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver has full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals to confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter extracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power subsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and reliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized where multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each SU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal transmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we propose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting the interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user. According to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline strategies in terms of security and reliability.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Reliability in Overlay Radio Networks with Time Switching and Power Splitting Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are acknowledged for their ability to tackle the issue of spectrum under-utilization. In the realm of CRNs, this paper investigates the energy efficiency issue and addresses the critical challenge of optimizing system reliability for overlay CRN access mode. Randomly dispersed secondary users (SUs) serving as relays for primary users (PUs) are considered, in which one of these relays is designated to harvest energy through the time switching-energy harvesting (EH) protocol. Moreover, this relay amplifies-and-forwards (AF) the PU's messages and broadcasts them along with its own across cascaded $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading channels. The power splitting protocol is another EH approach utilized by the SU and PU receivers to enhance the amount of energy in their storage devices. In addition, the SU transmitters and the SU receiver are deployed with multiple antennas for reception and apply the maximal ratio combining approach. The outage probability is utilized to assess both networks' reliability. Then, an energy efficiency evaluation is performed to determine the effectiveness of EH on the system. Finally, an optimization problem is provided with the goal of maximizing the data rate of the SUs by optimizing the time switching and the power allocation parameters of the SU relay.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning-based MARL for Strengthening Physical-Layer Security in B5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of a federated learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enhance physical-layer security (PLS) in a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach. Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and complexity.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, there is increasing demand for real-time data collection using UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks. This paper investigates the problem of minimizing the age of information (AoI) in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks by optimizing the UAV flight routing. We formulate the AoI minimization task and propose a large language model (LLM)-assisted UAV routing algorithm (LAURA). LAURA employs an LLM as intelligent crossover operators within an evolutionary optimization framework to efficiently explore the solution space. Simulation results show that LAURA outperforms benchmark methods in reducing the maximum AoI, especially in scenarios with a large number of sensor nodes.</description>

      <title>WiLLM: an Open Framework for LLM Services over Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) services fundamentally differ from traditional Deep Neural Network (DNN) applications in wireless networks. We identify three critical distinctions: (1) unlike traditional DNNs with unidirectional data flows, LLM's multimodal interactions create bidirectional heavy loads with contrasting bottlenecks, requiring direction-aware resource scheduling; (2) while traditional DNNs exhibit fixed computational patterns, LLM's highly variable inference times interact complexly with network slicing, causing dynamic bottleneck migration; and (3) in contrast to predictable DNN traffic, LLM's token streams demonstrate unprecedented burstiness and state dependencies. These insights motivate WiLLM, the first open-source framework, implemented as a wireless platform, for LLM service research. Built on OpenAirInterface, WiLLM introduces several technical innovations: dynamic slice compatibility, universal UE compatibility through application-layer tunneling, multi-UE multi-slice scheduling, dual-mode resource allocation, and cross-layer APIs. In addition, WiLLM eliminates the need for specialized wireless expertise, enabling researchers and developers to experiment with LLM services over realistic cellular networks. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities through a smart glasses case study and provide a comprehensive dataset of \~1.6 million synchronized measurements. The complete system, dataset, and appendix are available at https://openwillm.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications has led to an increased demand for advanced analytics and machine learning techniques capable of handling the challenges associated with data privacy, security, and scalability. Federated learning (FL) and blockchain technologies have emerged as promising approaches to address these challenges by enabling decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving model training on distributed data sources. In this paper, we present a novel IoT solution that combines the incremental learning vector quantization algorithm (XuILVQ) with Ethereum blockchain technology to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing, model training, and prototype storage in a distributed environment. Our proposed architecture addresses the shortcomings of existing blockchain-based FL solutions by reducing computational and communication overheads while maintaining data privacy and security. We assess the performance of our system through a series of experiments, showcasing its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning tasks in IoT settings.</description>
