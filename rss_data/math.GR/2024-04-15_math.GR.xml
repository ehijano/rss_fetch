      <title>Products of free groups inside graph braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $\Gamma$ and a number $n$, the associated $n^{th}$ graph braid group $B_n(\Gamma)$ is the fundamental group of the unordered configuration space of $n$ points on $\Gamma$. \'{S}wi\k{a}tkowski showed that for a given $\Gamma$ and $n$ large enough, there is a free abelian subgroup of $B_n(\Gamma)$ of rank equal to the cohomological dimension of $B_n(\Gamma)$. In this note, we observe that at the cost of possibly adding additional points, we can find a subgroup of the same cohomological dimension which is a direct product of non-abelian free groups, and give some applications.</description>

      <title>Binary bi-braces and applications to cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a XOR-based alternating block cipher the plaintext is masked by a sequence of layers each performing distinct actions: a highly nonlinear permutation, a linear transformation, and the bitwise key addition. When assessing resistance against classical differential attacks (where differences are computed with respect to XOR), the cryptanalysts must only take into account differential probabilities introduced by the nonlinear layer, this being the only one whose differential transitions are not deterministic. The temptation of computing differentials with respect to another difference operation runs into the difficulty of understanding how differentials propagate through the XOR-affine levels of the cipher. In this paper we introduce a special family of braces that enable the derivation of a set of differences whose interaction with every layer of an XOR-based alternating block cipher can be understood. We show that such braces can be described also in terms of alternating binary algebras of nilpotency class two. Additionally, we present a method to compute the automorphism group of these structures through an equivalence between bilinear maps. By doing so, we characterise the XOR-linear permutations for which the differential transitions with respect to the new difference are deterministic, facilitating an alternative differential attack.</description>

      <title>Semi-group compactifications of Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for algebraic groups over local fields of characteristic zero, the following are equivalent: Every homomorphism has a closed image, every unitary representation decomposes into a direct sum of finite-dimensional and mixing representations, and that the matrix coefficients are dense within the algebra of weakly almost periodic functions over the group. In our proof, we employ methods from semi-group theory. We establish that algebraic groups are \emph{compactification-centric}, meaning $sG = Gs$ for any element $s$ in the weakly almost periodic compactification of the group $G$.</description>

      <title>Skew two-sided bracoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isabel Martin-Lyons and Paul J.Truman generalized the definition of a skew brace to give a new algebraic object, which they termed a skew bracoid. Their construction involves two groups interacting in a manner analogous to the compatibility condition found in the definition of a skew brace. They formulated tools for characterizing and classifying skew bracoids, and studied substructures and quotients of skew bracoids. In this paper we study two-sided bracoids. In \cite{WR07} Rump showed that if a left brace $(B, \star ,\cdot )$ is a two-sided brace and the operation $\ast : B \times B \longrightarrow B$ is defined by $a \ast b = a\cdot b \star \overline{a} \star \overline{b}$ for all $a, b \in B$ then $(B, \star ,\ast )$ is a Jacobson radical ring. Lau showed that if $(B, \star ,\cdot )$ is a left brace and the operation is asssociative, then $B$ is a two-sided brace. We will prove bracoid versions of this results.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow. Moreover, it is strongly mixing. We obtain a higher rank analogue of this theorem. Let $\Gamma$ be a relatively Anosov subgroup of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. For every linear form $\psi$ tangent to the growth indicator of $\Gamma$, there is a canonical one-dimensional flow space $(\Omega_\psi, m_\psi, \phi_t)$ such that the non-wandering set $\Omega_\Gamma$ for the diagonal flow is a $\ker\psi$-vector bundle over $\Omega_\psi$ and the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\Omega_\Gamma$ is the product $m_\psi \otimes \mathrm{Leb}_{\ker\psi}$. We show that $m_{\psi}$ is of finite measure and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the flow $\{\phi_t\}$. Moreover, $(\Omega_{\psi}, m_{\psi}, \phi_t)$ is strongly mixing. The main ingredient is our construction of a reparameterization of the flow $\{\phi_t\}$ on $\Omega_{\psi}$ by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning cusp space of $\Gamma$, which has an exponentially expanding property along unstable foliations.</description>

      <title>The Grunwald problem and homogeneous spaces with non-solvable stabilisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the Grunwald problem for new families of non-solvable finite groups G, away from the set of primes dividing |G|. Furthermore, we show that such G verify the condition (BM), that is, the Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation is the only one for quotients of SL_n by G. These new families include extensions of groups satisfying (BM) by kernels which are products of symmetric groups S_m, with $m\neq 2,6$, and alternating groups A_5. We also investigate (BM) for small groups by giving an explicit list of small order groups for which (BM) is unknown and we show that for many of them (BM) holds under Schinzel's hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Conformal blocks for Galois covers of algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.00118v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spaces of twisted conformal blocks attached to a $\Gamma$-curve $\Sigma$ with marked $\Gamma$-orbits and an action of $\Gamma$ on a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite group. We prove that if $\Gamma$ stabilizes a Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, then Propagation Theorem and Factorization Theorem hold. We endow a flat projective connection on the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks attached to a smooth family of pointed $\Gamma$-curves; in particular, it is locally free. We also prove that the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks on the stable compactification of Hurwitz stack is locally free.
  Let $\mathscr{G}$ be the parahoric Bruhat-Tits group scheme on the quotient curve $\Sigma/\Gamma$ obtained via the $\Gamma$-invariance of Weil restriction associated to $\Sigma$ and the simply-connected simple algebraic group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that the space of twisted conformal blocks can be identified with the space of generalized theta functions on the moduli stack of quasi-parabolic $\mathscr{G}$-torsors on $\Sigma/\Gamma$ when the level $c$ is divisible by $|\Gamma|$ (establishing a conjecture due to Pappas-Rapoport).</description>

Abstract: We present a uniform approach to the construction of the groups of type $\mathrm{E}_6$ over arbitrary fields without using Lie theory. This gives a simple description of the group generators and some of the subgroup structure. In the finite case our approach also permits relatively straightforward computation of the group order.</description>

      <title>On the action of relatively irreducible automorphisms on their train tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and let ${\mathcal G}$ be a free factor system of $G$, namely a free splitting of $G$ as $G=G_1*\dots*G_k*F_r$. In this paper, we study the set of train track points for ${\mathcal G}$-irreducible automorphisms $\phi$ with exponential growth (relatively to ${\mathcal G}$). Such set is known to coincide with the minimally displaced set $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ of $\phi$.
  Our main result is that $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is co-compact, under the action of the cyclic subgroup generated by $\phi$.
  Along the way we obtain other results that could be of independent interest. For instance, we prove that any point of $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is in uniform distance from $\operatorname{Min}(\phi^{-1})$. We also prove that the action of $G$ on the product of the attracting and the repelling trees for $\phi$, is discrete. Finally, we get some fine insight about the local topology of relative outer space.
  As an application, we generalise a classical result of Bestvina, Feighn and Handel for the centralisers of irreducible automorphisms of free groups, in the more general context of relatively irreducible automorphisms of a free product. We also deduce that centralisers of elements of $\operatorname{Out}(F_3)$ are finitely generated, which was previously unknown. Finally, we mention that an immediate corollary of co-compactness is that $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is quasi-isometric to a line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group is CSA, if all of its maximal abelian subgroups are malnormal. It is known that every non-abelian CSA group is an equational domain. We generalize this result in two directions: we show that for a non-nilpotent group $G$ and a fixed positive integer $k$, if all maximal elements in the set of class $k$ nilpotent subgroups of $G$ are malnormal, then $G$ is an equational domain. Also, we prove that if a group $G$ is not locally nilpotent and if every maximal locally nilpotent subgroup of $G$ is malnormal, then $G$ is an equational domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ of order $n.$ Denote the sum of the inverse-power of element orders in $G$ by $m(G).$ Let $\mathbb{Z}_n$ be the cyclic group of order $n.$ Suppose $G$ is a non-cyclic group of order $n$ then we show that $m(G)\geq \frac{5}{4}m(\mathbb{Z}_n).$ Our result improves the inequality $m(G)&gt;m(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ obtained by Baniasad Azad, M., and Khorsravi B. Moreover, this bound is best as for $n=4l, l$ odd, there exists a group $G$ of order $n$ satisfying $m(G)=\frac{5}{4}m(\mathbb{Z}_n)$. Moreover, we will establish that $\frac{1}{q-1}m(G)&lt; m(\mathbb{Z}_n)\leq \frac{4}{5}m(G),$ where $G$ is a non-cyclic group of odd order.</description>

      <title>Strong ergodicity phenomena for Bernoulli shifts of bounded algebraic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.04989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic dimension of a Polish permutation group $Q\leq \mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb{N})$ is the smallest $n\in\omega$, so that for all $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of size $n+1$, the orbit of every $a\in A$ under the pointwise stabilizer of $A\setminus\{a\}$ is finite. We study the Bernoulli shift $P\curvearrowright \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ for various Polish permutation groups $P$ and we provide criteria under which the $P$-shift is generically ergodic relative to the injective part of the $Q$-shift, when $Q$ has algebraic dimension $\leq n$. We use this to show that the sequence of pairwise $*$-reduction-incomparable equivalence relations defined in [KP21] is a strictly increasing sequence in the Borel reduction hierarchy. We also use our main theorem to exhibit an equivalence relation of pinned cardinal $\aleph_1^{+}$ which strongly resembles the equivalence relation of pinned cardinal $\aleph_1^{+}$ from [Zap11], but which does not Borel reduce to the latter. It remains open whether they are actually incomparable under Borel reductions.
  Our proofs rely on the study of symmetric models whose symmetries come from the group $Q$. We show that when $Q$ is "locally finite" -- e.g. when $Q=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{M})$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is a locally finite countable structure with no algebraicity -- the corresponding symmetric model admits a theory of supports which is analogous to that in the basic Cohen model.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Guarnieri and Vendramin on the number of braces of a given order whose multiplicative group is a generalised quaternion group.
