      <title>Zigzagging Diffusion and Non-Standard Transport in Particle-laden Nanopores Under Extreme Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding transport subject to molecular-scale confinement is key to advancing nanofluidics, yet classical hydrodynamic laws often fail at these scales. Here, we study a model system: transport of toluene as a solvent and small fullerenes as model particles confined within alumina slit nanopores using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that toluene organizes into discrete layers whose commensurability with the pore width leads to a striking, non-monotonic, zig-zag dependence of transport coefficients on confinement. This layering drives oscillations not only in solvent diffusivity but also in flow velocity and permeability under pressure-driven conditions, breaking the expected scaling relations between diffusion, viscosity, and flow. Surprisingly, introducing a nanoparticle does not wash out these effects - although the fullerene perturbs local layering, the nanoparticle diffusivity retains a zig-zag dependence on pore width. Our results demonstrate how structural commensurability and interfacial effects dominate transport in nanoconfined liquids, and lead to important deviations from continuum expectations. These findings establish a microscopic basis for size-dependent transport in nanopores and highlight the need for beyond-hydrodynamic models in confined soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling the glassy dynamics of active particles: Tunable fragility and reentrance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles, a model system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Crossover in growth law in the vapor-liquid phase separation inside complex porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the domain morphology and growth kinetics of a vapor-liquid system embedded within a complex porous medium. By systematically varying the pore structure, we analyze the scaling behavior of correlation functions, structure factors, and domain growth exponents. The structure factor confirms the breakdown of Porod law and the emergence of fractal-like domain boundaries. Our key finding is the clear crossover in the domain growth law, from the classical power-law behavior observed in bulk fluids to a slower, logarithmic regime in highly confined systems. This transition is driven by energy barriers introduced by the porous geometry, which inhibit coarsening dynamics at later time. We provide a scaling analysis which further confirms this crossover and quantitatively connects the growth behavior with the average pore size.</description>

      <title>Influence of preparation and architecture on the elastic modulus of polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic modulus $G$ of a polymer network depends notably on parameters such as the initial concentration of the monomers before the synthesis ($\rho_0$), the density of the cross-linker, or the topology of the network. Understanding how these factors influence the stiffness of the sample is hampered by the fact that in experiments it is difficult to tune them individually. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study how these quantities, as well as excluded volume interactions, affect the elastic modulus of the network. We find that for a regular diamond network, $G$ is independent of the initial monomer concentration, while for disordered networks (monodisperse or polydisperse) the modulus increases with $\rho_0$, at odds with the classical predictions for rubber elasticity. Analysis of the network structure reveals that, for the disordered networks, defects contribute only weakly to the observed increase, and that instead the $\rho_0$-dependence of $G$ can be rationalized by the presence of a pre-strain in the sample. This pre-strain can be quantified by the topological factor introduced in the affine network theory (ANT). Comparison of the disordered networks with their phantom counterparts reveals that weakly crosslinked systems show a stronger $\rho_0$-dependence of $G$ due to an increase in entanglements at higher $\rho_0$, and that the polydisperse networks contain more entanglements than the monodisperse ones with the same average strand length. Finally we discuss the quantitative application of ANT to the simulated real networks and their phantom counterparts and conclude that the presence of excluded volume effects must be comprehensively taken into account for reaching a qualitative understanding of the mechanical modulus of the disordered networks.</description>

      <title>Binary Mixtures of Intelligent Active Brownian Particles with Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective properties of a binary mixture of A- and B-type self-steering particles endowed with visual perception are studied by computer simulations. Active Brownian particles are employed with an additional steering mechanism, which enables them to adjust their propulsion direction relative to the instantaneous positions of neighboring particles, depending on the species, either steering toward or away from them. Steering can be nonreciprocal between the A- and B-type particles. The underlying dynamical and structural properties of the system are governed by the strength and polarity of the maneuverabilities associated with the vision-induced steering. The model predicts the emergence of a large variety of nonequilibrium behaviors, which we systematically characterize for all nine principal sign combinations of AA, BB, AB and BA maneuverabilites. In particular, we observe the formation of multimers, encapsulated aggregates, honeycomb lattices, and predator-prey pursuit. Notably, for a predator-prey system, the maneuverability and vision angle employed by a predator significantly impacts the spatial distribution of the surrounding prey particles. For systems with electric-charge-like interactions and non-stochiometric composition, we obtain at intermediate activity levels an enhanced diffusion compared to non-steering active Brownian particles.</description>

      <title>The Stress-Force-Fabric relation across shear bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of granular materials is highly dependent on grain connectivity (fabric), force transmission, and frictional mobilization at the particle scale. Furthermore, these bulk properties are strongly dependent on the geometry and history of loading. It is well established that anisotropy in fabric and force transmission through a granular packing directly relates to the bulk scale strength of the packing via the Stress-Force-Fabric (SFF) relation. We have recently verified the validity of this framework for a broad variety of loading histories and geometries in experimental granular packings, using photoelastic disks to measure individual interparticle contact forces. By tracking both particle positions and interparticle contact force vectors, we mapped the anisotropy of the fabric and forces to the macroscale stress and strain and found excellent agreement between the anisotropic particle-scale measures and the macroscale responses in experiments. Here, we present an analysis of the effect of strong spatial gradients (shear bands) using the SFF framework in a sheared annular geometry, finding that there are strong variations in contact orientation depending on the location within or outside the shear band, even though the principal loading direction is uniform. This highlights that the fabric connectivity significantly changes across the shear band but does not contribute to the direct loading of the material. We disentangle the effects of packing fraction gradients and boundary constraints on the differences in fabric orientation.</description>

      <title>Surface Induced Frustration of Inherent Dipolar Order in Nanoconfined Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface effects could play a dominant role in modifying the natural liquid order. In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate inwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite surfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under nano-confinement. The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules that give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn owe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed by surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the one from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide. This can give rise to short-to-intermediate range solvent-mediated interaction between two surfaces. Here we study the effects of such interactions on the dielectric constant of nano-confined liquids, not just water but also ordering at protein surfaces. The surfaces work at two levels: (i) induce orientational realignment, and (ii) alter the cross-correlations between water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analyses are used to address these aspects in confinement of slit pores, nano tube/cylinder, and nano sphere. In addition, we consider the hydration layers of multiple proteins with vastly different structural features. These studies give us a measure of the extent or the length scale of cross-correlations between dipole moments of water molecules. We find an interesting orientational arrangement in the protein hydration layers, giving rise to long-range molecular cross-correlations. To decouple the effect of HB from the effect of geometry, we additionally study acetonitrile under nanoconfinement. Importantly, while a protein's interior is characterized by a small dielectric constant, the dipole moment of a peptide bond is large, and thus susceptible to fluctuations in water.</description>

      <title>Surface phase behavior, not hydrogen bonding, governs hydrophobic attraction between extended solutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrophobic interactions are central to biological self-assembly and soft matter organization, yet their microscopic origins remain debated. Traditional explanations often attribute the increase in attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature to entropy changes resulting from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here, we present a different perspective based on the physics of surface phase transitions, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated potential of mean force between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water model (mW), the SPC/E water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model grounded in a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and deviations from vapor-liquid coexistence, rather than specific hydrogen-bonding effects. Our results reproduce the characteristic inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity and demonstrate that such behavior arises generically due to a rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell, independent of hydrogen bonding. This work reframes hydrophobic interactions between extended solutes as a universal solvophobic phenomenon governed by surface phase behavior.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse-Interface Marangoni Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel Marangoni-induced instability that arises exclusively in diffuse fluid interfaces, absent in classical sharp-interface models. Using a validated phase-field Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn framework, we linearize the governing equations to analyze the onset and development of interfacial instability driven by solute-induced surface tension gradients. A critical interfacial thickness scaling inversely with the Marangoni number, $\delta_\mathrm{cr} \sim Ma^{-1}$, emerges from the balance between advective and diffusive transport. Unlike sharp-interface scenarios where matched viscosity and diffusivity stabilize the interface, finite thickness induces asymmetric solute distributions and tangential velocity shifts that destabilize the system. We identify universal power-law scalings of velocity and concentration offsets with a modified Marangoni number $Ma^\delta$, independent of capillary number and interfacial mobility. A critical crossover at $Ma^\delta \approx 590$ distinguishes diffusion-dominated stabilization from advection-driven destabilization. These findings highlight the importance of diffuse-interface effects in multiphase flows, with implications for miscible fluids, soft matter, and microfluidics where interfacial thickness and coupled transport phenomena are non-negligible.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of water's glass transition and a possible liquid-liquid transition within its supercooled state is hampered by its inevitable crystallization in a temperature range, termed "no-man's land". Here we report dielectric-spectroscopy and calorimetry measurements of pure water and various aqueous LiCl solutions, part of the latter being quenched to avoid crystallization. By investigating solutions of relatively low salt content and by covering an exceptionally broad frequency range up to THz, we find strong hints at a crossover in water from a strong to a fragile liquid, characterized by different glass-transition temperatures and different non-Arrhenius temperature dependences of the molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.</description>

Abstract: Conical microfluidic channels filled with electrolytes exhibit volatile memristive behavior, offering a promising platform for energy-efficient, neuromorphic computing. Here, we integrate these iontronic channels as additional nonlinear elements in nonlinear Shinriki-inspired oscillators and demonstrate that they exhibit alternating chaotic and non-chaotic dynamics across a broad frequency range. Exploiting this behavior, we construct XOR and NAND gates by coupling three Memriki oscillators, and we further realize the full set of standard logic gates through combinations of NAND gates. Our results establish a new paradigm for iontronic computing and open avenues for scalable, low-power logical operations in microfluidic and bio-inspired systems.</description>

      <title>Packing3D: An Open-Source Analytical Framework for Computing Packing Density and Mixing Indices Using Partial Spherical Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurement of packing density. We introduce Packing3D, an open-source Julia package providing analytic, partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. Our goals were to (1) eliminate boundary-artifact jumps, (2) maintain high throughput on large datasets, and (3) deliver standard mixing metrics via a unified API. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. A short-circuit bounding-sphere test shortens computations: fully inside or outside spheres are handled in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, and only near-boundary spheres invoke the analytic kernels. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. Packing3D converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and processes up to $10^8$ sphere-cell intersections per second in single-threaded Julia with linear scaling in particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). Packing3D provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimisation in granular process engineering.

      <title>Fluctuations of driven probes reveal nonequilibrium transitions in complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs, typical of active microrheology setups, exhibit poorly understood nonequilibrium behaviors because of the intricate self-organization of their mesoscopic constituents. In this work we show how to identify changes in the microstructural conformation of the fluid by monitoring the variance of the probe position, based on a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem. To illustrate our method, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of an effective model of micellar solution, and we link the different scaling regimes in the variance of the probe's position to the transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes the accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind the nonlinear friction curves recently measured in micellar solutions, pointing at a mechanism for the observed multi-step rheology. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method, applicable in experiments, to detect nonequilibrium transitions in the structure of complex fluids.</description>
