      <title>Indecomposable continua for unbounded itineraries of exponential maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the exponential maps $E_\lambda: \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ defined by $E_\lambda(z) = \lambda e^z$, where $\lambda &gt; \frac{1}{e}$. We prove that for itineraries of a certain form, the set of all points sharing the given itinerary, together with the point at infinity, is an indecomposable continuum in the Riemann sphere. These itineraries contain infinitely many blocks of zeros whose lengths increase, and they may be unbounded. We prove that in every such continuum, there exists exactly one point whose $\omega$-limit set contains the repelling fixed point of $E_\lambda$. For every other point, the $\omega$-limit set is equal either to the point at infinity, or to the forward orbit of $0$ together with the point at infinity. Thus, we generalize the results of R. Devaney and X. Jarque concerning indecomposable continua for bounded itineraries.</description>

      <title>Global smooth rigidity for toral automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity of a conjugacy between a hyperbolic or partially hyperbolic toral automorphism $L$ and a $C^\infty$ diffeomorphism $f$ of the torus. For a very weakly irreducible hyperbolic automorphism $L$ we show that any $C^1$ conjugacy is $C^\infty$. For a very weakly irreducible ergodic partially hyperbolic automorphism $L$ we show that any $C^{1+\text{H\"older}}$ conjugacy is $C^\infty$. As a corollary, we improve regularity of the conjugacy to $C^\infty$ in prior local and global rigidity results.</description>

      <title>Existence of Trust-field in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) play a crucial role in enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency by enabling communication between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I). Robust trust management is necessary to ensure the reliability of information in decentralized systems. This paper presents the notion of a ``Trust Field" in VANETs, conceptualized as the behavior of the nodes that represents trust levels evolving in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Using the LogitTrust model, we provide empirical evidence of how trust fields in vehicular networks change over time in different scenarios, including when malicious nodes are present. The results of our study demonstrate that the trust domain can adjust to fluctuations in network conditions, thereby offering a comprehensive metric for assessing the reliability of nodes. This innovative method improves the dependability of VANET applications by efficiently detecting and mitigating malicious actions.</description>

      <title>Reduced Data-Driven Turbulence Closure for Capturing Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, stochastic, a-posteriori, turbulence closure model based on a reduced subgrid scale term. This subgrid scale term is tailor-made to capture the statistics of a small set of spatially-integrate quantities of interest (QoIs), with only one unresolved scalar time series per QoI. In contrast to other data-driven surrogates the dimension of the ``learning problem" is reduced from an evolving field to one scalar time series per QoI. We use an a-posteriori, nudging approach to find the distribution of the scalar series over time. This approach has the advantage of taking the interaction between the solver and the surrogate into account. A stochastic surrogate parametrization is obtained by random sampling from the found distribution for the scalar time series. Compared to an a-priori trained convolutional neural network, evaluating the new method is computationally much cheaper and gives similar long-term statistics.</description>

      <title>Priestley duality and representations of recurrent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary dynamical system there is a strong relationship between global dynamics and the order structure of an appropriately constructed Priestley space. This connection provides an order-theoretic framework for studying global dynamics. In the classical setting, the chain recurrent set, introduced by C. Conley, is an example of an ordered Stone space or Priestley space. Priestley duality can be applied in the setting of dynamics on arbitrary topological spaces and yields a notion of Hausdorff compactification of the (chain) recurrent set.</description>

      <title>On postcritical sets of quadratic polynomials with a neutral fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of postcritical sets of quadratic polynomials with a neutral fixed point is a main ingredient in the remarkable work of Buff and Ch\'eritat to construct quadratic Julia sets with positive area. Based on the Inou-Shishikura theory, they obtained the control for the case of rotation numbers of bounded high type. Later, Cheraghi developed several elaborate analytic techniques based on Inou-Shishikura's results and obtained the control for the case of rotation numbers of high type. In this paper, based on the pseudo-Siegel disk theory of Dudko and Lyubich, we obtained the control for the general case.</description>

      <title>Online learning of Koopman operator using streaming data from different dynamical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a framework for online learning of the Koopman operator using streaming data. Many complex systems for which data-driven modeling and control are sought provide streaming sensor data, the abundance of which can present computational challenges but cannot be ignored. Streaming data can intermittently sample dynamically different regimes or rare events which could be critical to model and control. Using ideas from subspace identification, we present a method where the Grassmannian distance between the subspace of an extended observability matrix and the streaming segment of data is used to assess the `novelty' of the data. If this distance is above a threshold, it is added to an archive and the Koopman operator is updated if not it is discarded. Therefore, our method identifies data from segments of trajectories of a dynamical system that are from different dynamical regimes, prioritizes minimizing the amount of data needed in updating the Koopman model and furthermore reduces the number of basis functions by learning them adaptively. Therefore, by dynamically adjusting the amount of data used and learning basis functions, our method optimizes the model's accuracy and the system order.</description>

      <title>On rigidity properties of time-changes of unipotent flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time-changes of unipotent flows on finite volume quotients of semisimple linear groups, generalising previous work by Ratner on time-changes of horocycle flows. Any measurable isomorphism between time-changes of unipotent flows gives rise to a non-trivial joining supported on its graph. Under a spectral gap assumption on the groups, we show the following rigidity result: either the only limit point of this graph joining under the action of a one-parameter renormalising subgroup is the trivial joining, or the isomorphism is "affine", namely it is obtained composing an algebraic isomorphism with a (non-constant) translation along the centraliser.</description>

      <title>Identification Methods for Ordinal Potential Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12963v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two new identification methods for linear quadratic (LQ) ordinal potential differential games (OPDGs). Potential games are notable for their benefits, such as the computability and guaranteed existence of Nash Equilibria. While previous research has analyzed ordinal potential static games, their applicability to various engineering applications remains limited. Despite the earlier introduction of OPDGs, a systematic method for identifying a potential game for a given LQ differential game has not yet been developed. To address this gap, we propose two identification methods to provide the quadratic potential cost function for a given LQ differential game. Both methods are based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The first method aims to minimize the condition number of the potential cost function's parameters, offering a faster and more precise technique compared to earlier solutions. In addition, we present an evaluation of the feasibility of the structural requirements of the system. The second method, with a less rigid formulation, can identify LQ OPDGs in cases where the first method fails. These novel identification methods are verified through simulations, demonstrating their advantages and potential in designing and analyzing cooperative control systems.</description>

      <title>Geodesic tracking and the shape of ergodic rotation sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a structure theorem for ergodic homological rotation sets of homeomorphisms isotopic to the identity on a closed orientable hyperbolic surface: this set is made of a finite number of pieces that are either one-dimensional or almost convex. The latter ones give birth to horseshoes; in the case of a zero-entropy homeomorphism we show that there exists a geodesic lamination containing the directions in which generic orbits with respect to ergodic invariant probabilities turn around the surface under iterations of the homeomorphism. The proof is based on the idea of $\textit{geodesic tracking}$ of orbits that are typical for some invariant measure by geodesics on the surface, that allows to get links between the dynamics of such points and the one of the geodesic flow on some invariant subset of the unit tangent bundle of the surface.</description>

      <title>Properties of Immersions for Systems with Multiple Limit Sets with Implications to Learning Koopman Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear immersions (such as Koopman eigenfunctions) of a nonlinear system have wide applications in prediction and control. In this work, we study the properties of linear immersions for nonlinear systems with multiple omega-limit sets. While previous research has indicated the possibility of discontinuous one-to-one linear immersions for such systems, it has been unclear whether continuous one-to-one linear immersions are attainable. Under mild conditions, we prove that any continuous immersion to a class of systems including finite-dimensional linear systems collapses all the omega-limit sets, and thus cannot be one-to-one. Furthermore, we show that this property is also shared by approximate linear immersions learned from data as sample size increases and sampling interval decreases. Multiple examples are studied to illustrate our results.</description>
