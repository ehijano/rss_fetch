      <title>Jailbreak-Tuning: Models Efficiently Learn Jailbreak Susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However, this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks, underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Evasion Under Blockchain Sanctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sanctioning blockchain addresses has become a common regulatory response to malicious activities. However, enforcement on permissionless blockchains remains challenging due to complex transaction flows and sophisticated fund-obfuscation techniques. Using cryptocurrency mixing tool Tornado Cash as a case study, we quantitatively assess the effectiveness of U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions over a 957-day period, covering 6.79 million Ethereum blocks and 1.07 billion transactions. Our analysis reveals that while OFAC sanctions reduced overall Tornado Cash deposit volume by 71.03% to approximately 2 billion USD, attackers still relied on Tornado Cash in 78.33% of Ethereum-related security incidents, underscoring persistent evasion strategies.
  We identify three structural limitations in current sanction enforcement practices: (i) the susceptibility of binary sanction classifications to dusting attacks; (ii) fragmented censorship by blockchain producers; and (iii) the complexity of obfuscation services exploited by users. To address these gaps, we introduce a more practical algorithm for scoring and tracking, grounded in quantitative impurity. On average, our algorithm processes Ethereum blocks within 0.07 $\pm$ 0.03 seconds and achieves 97.61% precision and 74.08% recall when evaluated on the Bybit exploit. Our findings contribute to ongoing discussions around regulatory effectiveness in Decentralized Finance by providing empirical evidence, clarifying enforcement challenges, and informing future compliance strategies in response to sanctions and blockchain-based security risks.</description>

      <title>Space Cybersecurity Testbed: Fidelity Framework, Example Implementation, and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber threats against space infrastructures, including satellites and systems on the ground, have not been adequately understood. Testbeds are important to deepen our understanding and validate space cybersecurity studies. The state of the art is that there are very few studies on building testbeds, and there are few characterizations of testbeds. In this paper, we propose a framework for characterizing the fidelity of space cybersecurity testbeds. The framework includes 7 attributes for characterizing the system models, threat models, and defenses that can be accommodated by a testbed. We use the framework to guide us in building and characterizing a concrete testbed we have implemented, which includes space, ground, user, and link segments. In particular, we show how the testbed can accommodate some space cyber attack scenarios that have occurred in the real world, and discuss future research directions.</description>

      <title>How To Mitigate And Defend Against DDoS Attacks In IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly prevalent and dangerous in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, primarily due to the low-security configurations of many connected devices. This paper analyzes the nature and impact of DDoS attacks such as those launched by the Mirai botnet, and proposes layered mitigation strategies tailored to IoT environments. Key solutions explored include IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULA), edge computing, software-defined networking (SDN), honeypot deception, and machine learning-based intrusion detection systems. The paper aims to help engineers and researchers understand and implement practical countermeasures to protect IoT infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Challenges in GenAI and Authentication: a scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authentication and authenticity have been a security challenge since the beginning of information sharing, especially in the context of digital information. With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence, these challenges have evolved, demanding a more up-to-date analysis of their impacts on society and system security. This work presents a scoping review that analyzed 88 documents from the IEEExplorer, Scopus, and ACM databases, promoting an analysis of the resulting portfolio through six guiding questions focusing on the most relevant work, challenges, attack surfaces, threats, proposed solutions, and gaps. Finally, the portfolio articles are analyzed through this guiding research lens and also receive individualized analysis. The results consistently outline the challenges, gaps, and threats related to images, text, audio, and video, thereby supporting new research in the areas of authentication and generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Usability Challenges in Web Privacy Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing concerns around privacy and the enforcement of data privacy laws, many websites now provide users with privacy controls. However, locating these controls can be challenging, as they are frequently hidden within multiple settings and layers. Moreover, the lack of standardization means these controls can vary widely across services. The technical or confusing terminology used to describe these controls further complicates users' ability to understand and use them effectively. This paper presents a large-scale empirical analysis investigating usability challenges of web privacy controls across 18,628 websites. While aiming for a multi-scenario view, our automated data collection faced significant hurdles, particularly in simulating sign-up and authenticated user visits, leading to more focused insights on guest visit scenarios and challenges in automated capture of dynamic user interactions. Our heuristic evaluation of three different user visit scenarios identifies significant website usability issues. Our results show that privacy policies are most common across all visit scenarios, with nudges and notices being prevalent in sign-up situations. We recommend designing privacy controls that: enhance awareness through pop-up nudges and notices; offer a table of contents as navigational aids and customized settings links in policies for more informed choice; and ensure accessibility via direct links to privacy settings from nudges.</description>

      <title>Effective Fine-Tuning of Vision Transformers with Low-Rank Adaptation for Privacy-Preserving Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-rank adaptation method for training privacy-preserving vision transformer (ViT) models that efficiently freezes pre-trained ViT model weights. In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that of full-time tuning.</description>

      <title>Expanding ML-Documentation Standards For Better Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the current state of ML-security and of the documentation of ML-based systems, models and datasets in research and practice based on an extensive review of the existing literature. It shows a generally low awareness of security aspects among ML-practitioners and organizations and an often unstandardized approach to documentation, leading to overall low quality of ML-documentation. Existing standards are not regularly adopted in practice and IT-security aspects are often not included in documentation. Due to these factors, there is a clear need for improved security documentation in ML, as one step towards addressing the existing gaps in ML-security. To achieve this, we propose expanding existing documentation standards for ML-documentation to include a security section with specific security relevant information. Implementing this, a novel expanded method of documenting security requirements in ML-documentation is presented, based on the existing Model Cards and Datasheets for Datasets standards, but with the recommendation to adopt these findings in all ML-documentation.</description>

      <title>IDFace: Face Template Protection for Efficient and Secure Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy becomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's face template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered from the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as homomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS, HE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In particular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is basically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined shape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and the system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based face template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain systems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based secure and efficient face identification method with template protection. IDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching on a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The first technique is a template representation transformation that sharply reduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient encoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving the number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show that IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted templates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification over plaintexts.</description>

      <title>Toward an Intent-Based and Ontology-Driven Autonomic Security Response in Security Orchestration Automation and Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms must rapidly adapt to continuously evolving cyber attacks. Intent-Based Networking has emerged as a promising paradigm for cyber attack mitigation through high-level declarative intents, which offer greater flexibility and persistency than procedural actions. In this paper, we bridge the gap between two active research directions: Intent-Based Cyber Defense and Autonomic Cyber Defense, by proposing a unified, ontology-driven security intent definition leveraging the MITRE-D3FEND cybersecurity ontology. We also propose a general two-tiered methodology for integrating such security intents into decision-theoretic Autonomic Cyber Defense systems, enabling hierarchical and context-aware automated response capabilities. The practicality of our approach is demonstrated through a concrete use case, showcasing its integration within next-generation Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platforms.</description>

      <title>A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Advertising Personalization Incorporating Federated Learning and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate privacy leakage and performance issues in personalized advertising, this paper proposes a framework that integrates federated learning and differential privacy. The system combines distributed feature extraction, dynamic privacy budget allocation, and robust model aggregation to balance model accuracy, communication overhead, and privacy protection. Multi-party secure computing and anomaly detection mechanisms further enhance system resilience against malicious attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves dual optimization of recommendation accuracy and system efficiency while ensuring privacy, providing both a practical solution and a theoretical foundation for applying privacy protection technologies in advertisement recommendation.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Jailbreaking Vulnerabilities in Generative AI to Bypass Ethical Safeguards for Facilitating Phishing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of advanced Generative AI (GenAI) models such as DeepSeek and ChatGPT has significantly reshaped the cybersecurity landscape, introducing both promising opportunities and critical risks. This study investigates how GenAI powered chatbot services can be exploited via jailbreaking techniques to bypass ethical safeguards, enabling the generation of phishing content, recommendation of hacking tools, and orchestration of phishing campaigns. In ethically controlled experiments, we used ChatGPT 4o Mini selected for its accessibility and status as the latest publicly available model at the time of experimentation, as a representative GenAI system. Our findings reveal that the model could successfully guide novice users in executing phishing attacks across various vectors, including web, email, SMS (smishing), and voice (vishing). Unlike automated phishing campaigns that typically follow detectable patterns, these human-guided, AI assisted attacks are capable of evading traditional anti phishing mechanisms, thereby posing a growing security threat. We focused on DeepSeek and ChatGPT due to their widespread adoption and technical relevance in 2025. The study further examines common jailbreaking techniques and the specific vulnerabilities exploited in these models. Finally, we evaluate a range of mitigation strategies such as user education, advanced authentication mechanisms, and regulatory policy measures and discuss emerging trends in GenAI facilitated phishing, outlining future research directions to strengthen cybersecurity defenses in the age of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Efficient Control Flow Attestation by Speculating on Control Flow Path Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Flow Attestation (CFA) allows remote verification of run-time software integrity in embedded systems. However, CFA is limited by the storage/transmission costs of generated control flow logs (CFlog). Recent work has proposed application-specific optimizations by speculating on likely sub-paths in CFlog and replacing them with reserved symbols at runtime. Albeit effective, prior approaches do not consider the representation of addresses in a control flow path for speculation. This work proposes RESPEC-CFA, an architectural extension for CFA allowing for speculation on (1) the locality of control flows and (2) their Huffman encoding. Alone, RESPEC-CFA reduces CFlog sizes by up to 90.1%. Combined with prior methods, RESPEC-CFA yields reductions of up to 99.7%, representing a significant step toward practical CFA.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the confidential cloud through a unified low-level abstraction for composable isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing sensitive cloud workloads requires composing confidential virtual machines (CVMs) with nested enclaves or sandboxes. Unfortunately, each new isolation boundary adds ad-hoc access control mechanisms, hardware extensions, and trusted software. This escalating complexity bloats the TCB, complicates end-to-end attestation, and leads to fragmentation across platforms and cloud service providers (CSPs).
  We introduce a unified isolation model that delegates enforceable, composable, and attestable isolation to a single trusted security monitor: Tyche. Tyche provides an API for partitioning, sharing, attesting, and reclaiming resources through its core abstraction, trust domains (TDs). To provide fine-grain isolation, TDs can recursively create and manage sub-TDs. Tyche captures these relationships in attestations, allowing cloud tenants to reason about end-to-end security. TDs serve as the building blocks for constructing composable enclaves, sandboxes, and CVMs.
  Tyche runs on commodity x86_64 without hardware security extensions and can maintain backward compatibility with existing software. We provide an SDK to run and compose unmodified workloads as sandboxes, enclaves, and CVMs with minimal overhead compared to native Linux execution. Tyche supports complex cloud scenarios, such as confidential inference with mutually distrustful users, model owners, and CSPs. An additional RISC-V prototype demonstrates Tyche's portability across platforms.</description>

      <title>On One-Shot Signatures, Quantum vs Classical Binding, and Obfuscating Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot signatures (OSS) were defined by Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC'20). These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open.
  We give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming (sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also gives the first standard-model separation between classical and collapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open problem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional security relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model construction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations (permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs involving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs. In particular, obfuscating permutable PRPs gives a trapdoor one-way permutation that is \emph{full-domain}, solving another decade-old-problem of constructing this object from (sub-exponential) iO and one-way functions.</description>

      <title>Obfuscation of Unitary Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.
  In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.</description>

      <title>LLAMA: Multi-Feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing Framework with LLM-Guided Seed Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart contracts play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, and fuzzing remains an important approach to securing smart contracts. Even though mutation scheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers have primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation scheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work. In this work, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing framework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and hybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid initial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select high-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that simultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation scheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an evolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator probabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to escape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage and vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage and 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities across diverse categories. These results highlight LLAMA's effectiveness, adaptability, and practicality in real-world smart contract security testing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Adversarial Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.</description>

      <title>Thought Purity: Defense Paradigm For Chain-of-Thought Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.</description>

      <title>Bounding the asymptotic quantum value of all multipartite compiled non-local games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-local games are a powerful tool to distinguish between correlations possible in classical and quantum worlds. Kalai et al. (STOC'23) proposed a compiler that converts multipartite non-local games into interactive protocols with a single prover, relying on cryptographic tools to remove the assumption of physical separation of the players. While quantum completeness and classical soundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games, quantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.
  In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing that any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond to quantum commuting strategies.
  Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on a characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby generalising several previous results. On the way, we construct universal C*-algebras of sequential PVMs and prove a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Incentive Mechanism for Poison-Resilient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model. Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3 percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries. This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light, budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Balancing Confidentiality and Transparency for Blockchain-based Process-Aware Information Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain enables novel, trustworthy Process-Aware Information Systems (PAISs) by enforcing the security, robustness, and traceability of operations. In particular, transparency ensures that all information exchanges are openly accessible, fostering trust within the system. Although this is a desirable property to enable notarization and auditing activities, it also represents a limitation for such cases where confidentiality is a requirement since interactions involve sensitive data. Current solutions rely on obfuscation techniques or private infrastructures, hindering the enforcement capabilities of smart contracts and the public verifiability of transactions. Against this background, we propose CONFETTY, an architecture for blockchain-based PAISs to preserve confidentiality and transparency. Smart contracts enact, enforce and store public interactions, while attribute-based encryption techniques are adopted to specify access grants to confidential information. We assess the security of our solution through a systematic threat model analysis and evaluate its practical feasibility by gauging the performance of our implemented prototype in different scenarios from the literature.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Unreliable for Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.</description>

      <title>What's Pulling the Strings? Evaluating Integrity and Attribution in AI Training and Inference through Concept Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Cryptanalytic Time-Space Lower Bounds via a Shearer-like Inequality for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power of adaptivity in algorithms has been intensively studied in diverse areas of theoretical computer science. In this paper, we obtain a number of sharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant extra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited) preprocessing time.
  Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic group of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the problem has time complexity $T=O(\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ bits of space (up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability.
  We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string of $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that depend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element).
  We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of the baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string is more than $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the classical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit preprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp lower bounds for several other cryptanalytic problems.
  To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing non-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision problems in a unified way. Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in our model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, our proof uses a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe, Cordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011). This seems to be the first time a variant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessments for Offensive Cybersecurity Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.</description>

      <title>ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Scalable Differentially Private Sketches under Continual Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sketches are a fundamental tool in data stream analytics. They are notable for supporting both approximate frequency queries and heavy hitter detection with bounded trade-offs for error and memory. Importantly, on streams that contain sensitive information, sketches can be easily privatized with the injection of a suitable amount of noise. This process is efficient in the single-release model, where the output is released only at the end of the stream. In this setting, it suffices to add noise to the sketch once.
  In contrast, in the continual observation model, where the output is released at every time-step, noise needs to be added to the sketch before each release. This creates an additional computational overhead. To address this, we introduce Lazy Sketch, a novel differentially private sketching method, in the continual observation model, that employs lazy updates, perturbing and modifying only a small portion of the sketch at each step. Compared to prior work, we reduce the update complexity by a factor of $O(w)$, where $w$ is the width of the sketch. Experiments demonstrate that our method increases throughput by up to 250x over prior work, making continual observation differential privacy practical for high-speed streaming applications.
  In addition, for heavy hitter detection, we present a new sketch-based algorithm that leverages lazy updates to achieve a per-update complexity of $O(d \log T/w + \log w)$, for sketches with dimension $d\times w$ and streams of length $T$. This marks a significant improvement over prior approaches in the streaming continual observation model, which require recomputing frequency estimates for every item in the input domain at each time step.</description>

      <title>When and Where do Data Poisons Attack Textual Inversion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of diffusion models (DMs). In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

      <title>Sharing is CAIRing: Characterizing Principles and Assessing Properties of Universal Privacy Evaluation for Synthetic Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data sharing is a necessity for innovative progress in many domains, especially in healthcare. However, the ability to share data is hindered by regulations protecting the privacy of natural persons. Synthetic tabular data provide a promising solution to address data sharing difficulties but does not inherently guarantee privacy. Still, there is a lack of agreement on appropriate methods for assessing the privacy-preserving capabilities of synthetic data, making it difficult to compare results across studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to identify properties that constitute good universal privacy evaluation metrics for synthetic tabular data. The goal of universally applicable metrics is to enable comparability across studies and to allow non-technical stakeholders to understand how privacy is protected. We identify four principles for the assessment of metrics: Comparability, Applicability, Interpretability, and Representativeness (CAIR). To quantify and rank the degree to which evaluation metrics conform to the CAIR principles, we design a rubric using a scale of 1-4. Each of the four properties is scored on four parameters, yielding 16 total dimensions. We study the applicability and usefulness of the CAIR principles and rubric by assessing a selection of metrics popular in other studies. The results provide granular insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing metrics that not only rank the metrics but highlight areas of potential improvements. We expect that the CAIR principles will foster agreement among researchers and organizations on which universal privacy evaluation metrics are appropriate for synthetic tabular data.</description>

      <title>Protecting Copyrighted Material with Unique Identifiers in Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary concern regarding training large language models (LLMs) is whether they abuse copyrighted online text. With the increasing training data scale and the prevalence of LLMs in daily lives, two problems arise: \textbf{1)} false positive membership inference results misled by similar examples; \textbf{2)} membership inference methods are usually too complex for end users to understand and use. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detect} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{\textbf{ghost sentences}} and a user-friendly last-$k$ words test, allowing end users to chat with LLMs for membership inference. Ghost sentences consist primarily of unique passphrases of random natural words, which can come with customized elements to bypass possible filter rules. The last-$k$ words test requires a significant repetition time of ghost sentences~($\ge10$). For cases with fewer repetitions, we designed an extra perplexity test, as LLMs exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. We also conduct a comprehensive study on the memorization and membership inference of ghost sentences, examining factors such as training data scales, model sizes, repetition times, insertion positions, wordlist of passphrases, alignment, \textit{etc}. Our study shows the possibility of applying ghost sentences in real scenarios and provides instructions for the potential application.</description>

      <title>Nanopass Back-Translation of Call-Return Trees for Mechanized Secure Compilation Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers aim to build secure compilation chains enforcing that if there is no attack a source context can mount against a source program then there is also no attack an adversarial target context can mount against the compiled program. Proving that these compilation chains are secure is, however, challenging, and involves a non-trivial back-translation step: for any attack a target context mounts against the compiled program one has to exhibit a source context mounting the same attack against the source program. We describe a novel back-translation technique, which results in simpler proofs that can be more easily mechanized in a proof assistant. Given a finite set of finite trace prefixes, capturing the interaction recorded during an attack between a target context and the compiled program, we build a call-return tree that we back-translate into a source context producing the same trace prefixes. We use state in the generated source context to record the current location in the call-return tree. The back-translation is done in several small steps, each adding to the tree new information describing how the location should change depending on how the context regains control. To prove this back-translation correct we give semantics to every intermediate call-return tree language, using ghost state to store information and explicitly enforce execution invariants. We prove several small forward simulations, basically seeing the back-translation as a verified nanopass compiler. Thanks to this modular structure, we are able to mechanize this complex back-translation and its correctness proof in the Rocq prover without too much effort.</description>

      <title>How does Watermarking Affect Visual Language Models in Document Understanding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have become foundational models for document understanding tasks, widely used in the processing of complex multimodal documents across domains such as finance, law, and academia. However, documents often contain noise-like information, such as watermarks, which inevitably leads us to inquire: \emph{Do watermarks degrade the performance of VLMs in document understanding?} To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to investigate the effect of visible watermarks on VLMs performance. We takes into account various factors, including different types of document data, the positions of watermarks within documents and variations in watermark content. Our experimental results reveal that VLMs performance can be significantly compromised by watermarks, with performance drop rates reaching up to 36\%. We discover that \emph{scattered} watermarks cause stronger interference than centralized ones, and that \emph{semantic contents} in watermarks creates greater disruption than simple visual occlusion. Through attention mechanism analysis and embedding similarity examination, we find that the performance drops are mainly attributed to that watermarks 1) force widespread attention redistribution, and 2) alter semantic representation in the embedding space. Our research not only highlights significant challenges in deploying VLMs for document understanding, but also provides insights towards developing robust inference mechanisms on watermarked documents.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Protection in the (Generative) Artificial Intelligence Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.</description>

      <title>From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.</description>

      <title>"Is it always watching? Is it always listening?" Exploring Contextual Privacy and Security Concerns Toward Domestic Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality.</description>
