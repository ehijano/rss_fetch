      <title>Partially Identified Heterogeneous Treatment Effect with Selection: An Application to Gender Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the sample selection model within the context of the gender gap problem, where even random treatment assignment is affected by selection bias. By offering a robust alternative free from distributional or specification assumptions, we bound the treatment effect under the sample selection model with an exclusion restriction, an assumption whose validity is tested in the literature. This exclusion restriction allows for further segmentation of the population into distinct types based on observed and unobserved characteristics. For each type, we derive the proportions and bound the gender gap accordingly. Notably, trends in type proportions and gender gap bounds reveal an increasing proportion of always-working individuals over time, alongside variations in bounds, including a general decline across time and consistently higher bounds for those in high-potential wage groups. Further analysis, considering additional assumptions, highlights persistent gender gaps for some types, while other types exhibit differing or inconclusive trends. This underscores the necessity of separating individuals by type to understand the heterogeneous nature of the gender gap.</description>

      <title>Forecasting short-term inflation in Argentina with Random Forest Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the performance of Random Forest models in forecasting short-term monthly inflation in Argentina, based on a database of monthly indicators since 1962. It is found that these models achieve forecast accuracy that is statistically comparable to the consensus of market analysts' expectations surveyed by the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) and to traditional econometric models. One advantage of Random Forest models is that, as they are non-parametric, they allow for the exploration of nonlinear effects in the predictive power of certain macroeconomic variables on inflation. Among other findings, the relative importance of the exchange rate gap in forecasting inflation increases when the gap between the parallel and official exchange rates exceeds 60%. The predictive power of the exchange rate on inflation rises when the BCRA's net international reserves are negative or close to zero (specifically, below USD 2 billion). The relative importance of inflation inertia and the nominal interest rate in forecasting the following month's inflation increases when the nominal levels of inflation and/or interest rates rise.</description>

      <title>Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.</description>

      <title>Smaller Confidence Intervals From IPW Estimators via Data-Dependent Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse propensity-score weighted (IPW) estimators are prevalent in causal inference for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies. Under unconfoundedness, given accurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, the size of confidence intervals of IPW estimators scales down with $n$, and, several of their variants improve the rate of scaling. However, neither IPW estimators nor their variants are robust to inaccuracies: even if a single covariate has an $\varepsilon&gt;0$ additive error in the propensity score, the size of confidence intervals of these estimators can increase arbitrarily. Moreover, even without errors, the rate with which the confidence intervals of these estimators go to zero with $n$ can be arbitrarily slow in the presence of extreme propensity scores (those close to 0 or 1).
  We introduce a family of Coarse IPW (CIPW) estimators that captures existing IPW estimators and their variants. Each CIPW estimator is an IPW estimator on a coarsened covariate space, where certain covariates are merged. Under mild assumptions, e.g., Lipschitzness in expected outcomes and sparsity of extreme propensity scores, we give an efficient algorithm to find a robust estimator: given $\varepsilon$-inaccurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, its confidence interval size scales with $\varepsilon+1/\sqrt{n}$. In contrast, under the same assumptions, existing estimators' confidence interval sizes are $\Omega(1)$ irrespective of $\varepsilon$ and $n$. Crucially, our estimator is data-dependent and we show that no data-independent CIPW estimator can be robust to inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>EM Estimation of Conditional Matrix Variate $t$ Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional matrix variate student $t$ distribution was introduced by Battulga (2024a). In this paper, we propose a new version of the conditional matrix variate student $t$ distribution. The paper provides EM algorithms, which estimate parameters of the conditional matrix variate student $t$ distributions, including general cases and special cases with Minnesota prior.</description>

      <title>New Tests of Equal Forecast Accuracy for Factor-Augmented Regressions with Weaker Loadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the theoretical foundation for the recently proposed tests of equal forecast accuracy and encompassing by Pitarakis (2023a) and Pitarakis (2023b), when the competing forecast specification is that of a factor-augmented regression model, whose loadings are allowed to be homogeneously/heterogeneously weak. This should be of interest for practitioners, as at the moment there is no theory available to justify the use of these simple and powerful tests in such context.</description>
