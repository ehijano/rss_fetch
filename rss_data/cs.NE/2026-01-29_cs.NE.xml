      <title>Hardware-Aware Model Design and Training of Silicon-based Analog Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon-based analog neural networks physically embody the ideal neural network model in an approximate way. We show that by retraining the neural network using a physics-informed hardware-aware model one can fully recover the inference accuracy of the ideal network model even in the presence of significant non-idealities. This is way more promising for scalability and integration density than the default option of improving the fidelity of the analog neural network at the cost of significant energy, area, and design overhead, through extensive calibration and conservative analog design.
  We first present a physics-informed hardware-aware model for a time-domain vector-matrix multiplier implemented with single-transistor floating-gate memory cells that explicitly accounts for two dominant non-idealities of the physical implementation - capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop - and integrates seamlessly with modern deep-learning workflows. The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips.</description>

      <title>Emergent Specialization in Learner Populations: Competition as the Source of Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can populations of learners develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives? We demonstrate that competition alone is sufficient to induce emergent specialization -- learners spontaneously partition into specialists for different environmental regimes through competitive dynamics, consistent with ecological niche theory. We introduce the NichePopulation algorithm, a simple mechanism combining competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking. Validated across six real-world domains (cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality), our approach achieves a mean Specialization Index of 0.75 with effect sizes of Cohen's d &gt; 20. Key findings: (1) At lambda=0 (no niche bonus), learners still achieve SI &gt; 0.30, proving specialization is genuinely emergent; (2) Diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5% through method-level division of labor; (3) Our approach outperforms MARL baselines (QMIX, MAPPO, IQL) by 4.3x while being 4x faster.</description>

      <title>NeuroAI and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made significant progress in the past few years but have only been loosely inter-connected. Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.</description>

      <title>Governing Strategic Dynamics: Equilibrium Stabilization via Divergence-Driven Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box coevolution in mixed-motive games is often undermined by opponent-drift non-stationarity and noisy rollouts, which distort progress signals and can induce cycling, Red-Queen dynamics, and detachment. We propose the \emph{Marker Gene Method} (MGM), a curriculum-inspired governance mechanism that stabilizes selection by anchoring evaluation to cross-generational marker individuals, together with DWAM and conservative marker-update rules to reduce spurious updates. We also introduce NGD-Div, which adapts the key update threshold using a divergence proxy and natural-gradient optimization. We provide theoretical analysis in strictly competitive settings and evaluate MGM integrated with evolution strategies (MGM-E-NES) on coordination games and a resource-depletion Markov game. MGM-E-NES reliably recovers target coordination in Stag Hunt and Battle of the Sexes, achieving final cooperation probabilities close to $(1,1)$ (e.g., $0.991\pm0.01/1.00\pm0.00$ and $0.97\pm0.00/0.97\pm0.00$ for the two players). In the Markov resource game, it maintains high and stable state-conditioned cooperation across 30 seeds, with final cooperation of $\approx 0.954/0.980/0.916$ in \textsc{Rich}/\textsc{Poor}/\textsc{Collapsed} (both players; small standard deviations), indicating welfare-aligned and state-dependent behavior. Overall, MGM-E-NES transfers across tasks with minimal hyperparameter changes and yields consistently stable training dynamics, showing that top-level governance can substantially improve the robustness of black-box coevolution in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Robust MAE-Driven NAS: From Mask Reconstruction to Architecture Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) relies heavily on labeled data, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method based on an unsupervised paradigm, specifically Masked Autoencoders (MAE), thereby eliminating the need for labeled data. By replacing the supervised learning objective with an image reconstruction task, our approach enables the efficient discovery of network architectures without compromising performance and generalization ability. Additionally, we address the problem of performance collapse encountered in the widely-used Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) in the unsupervised setting by designing a hierarchical decoder. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, offering empirical evidence of its superiority over the counterparts.</description>

      <title>Spiking Brain Compression: Post-Training Second-order Compression for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computational resources, parameter pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve the efficiency of SNNs. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot post-training compression framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based objective found in the common layer-wise compression method with a spike-train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to compress parameters and analytically rescale the rest. Applying SBC to SNN pruning and quantization across event-based and static datasets (up to ImageNet), including SEW-ResNet152 and spike-driven Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art one-shot post-training compression for SNNs, with single- to double-digit accuracy gains over ANN compression baselines ported to SNNs. We further report a synaptic-operation-based energy proxy and a calibration-size ablation, demonstrating robust performance under sub-one-sample-per-class calibration.</description>

      <title>QUASAR: An Evolutionary Algorithm to Accelerate High-Dimensional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge in computational science. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality. QUASAR expands upon the core principles of Differential Evolution (DE), introducing quasi-adaptive mechanisms to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation in its search. Inspired by the behavior of quantum particles, the algorithm utilizes three highly stochastic mechanisms that augment standard DE: 1) probabilistic mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying covariance reinitializations.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 test functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (367) using the Friedman test, outperforming DE (735) and L-SHADE (452). Geometric mean comparisons show average final solution quality improvements of $3.85 \times$ and $2.07 \times$ compared to DE and L-SHADE, respectively ($p \ll 0.001$), with average optimization speed averaging $1.40 \times$ and $5.16 \times$ faster. QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, efficient, and user-friendly evolutionary algorithm for complex high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Actionable Interpretability Must Be Defined in Terms of Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that interpretability research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally ill-posed as existing definitions of interpretability fail to describe how interpretability can be formally tested or designed for. We posit that actionable definitions of interpretability must be formulated in terms of *symmetries* that inform model design and lead to testable conditions. Under a probabilistic view, we hypothesise that four symmetries (inference equivariance, information invariance, concept-closure invariance, and structural invariance) suffice to (i) formalise interpretable models as a subclass of probabilistic models, (ii) yield a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion, and (iii) provide a formal framework to verify compliance with safety standards and regulations.</description>
