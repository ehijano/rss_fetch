      <title>CLARA: A Modular Framework for Unsupervised Transit Detection Using TESS Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). All computations were performed on a personal, CPU-only desktop with an Intel Core i3-8100 processor and 32 GB RAM, using parallelized scoring and classification routines across four physical cores. CLARA processed over 87,000 TESS SPOC light curves (Sectors 1-5) without GPU acceleration in Part-II.</description>

      <title>Development of PANOSETI Telescopes for Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-High-Energy (UHE, E $&gt;100$ TeV) gamma rays are one of the few channels to search for and study Galactic PeVatrons. Among the most promising PeVatron candidates are the many UHE gamma-ray sources that have recently been identified on the Galactic Plane. Ground-based particle detectors see these sources as extended rather than point-like, and current generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) struggle to study them with effective areas and background rejection that are suboptimal at UHE. A cost-efficient way of constructing an array of IACTs explicitly designed for UHE sensitivity is to sparsely separate many small telescopes. We have simulated, prototyped, and twice deployed a pathfinder array that is instrumented with telescopes designed by the Panoramic Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) team. These 0.5-meter Fresnel lens telescopes are purpose-built for imaging optical transients on nanosecond timescales and are equipped with a $10^\circ\times10^\circ$ silicon photomultiplier camera. Three PANOSETI telescopes were deployed twice in the same temporary configuration at Lick Observatory in March and October 2024. Here we give a brief description of the instrument and present a comparison of simulations with the data collected, including an analysis of the Crab Nebula. We also report on the ongoing deployment of PANOSETI telescopes for the Dark100 array that is planned to operate for five years at Palomar Observatory.</description>

      <title>A semi-coherent search for optical pulsations from Scorpius X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of semi-coherent strategies in the search for optical pulsations from binary systems, which resulted in the tightest constraints on pulsations from Sco X-1. We analysed observations from the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the TNG spread across four years, for a total of $\sim$56 ks divided in two datasets. The great efficiency of semi-coherent techniques when only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available allowed us to set an upper limit at $9.23 \cdot 10^{-5}$ in pulsed amplitude for this source, improving on previous results by a factor of 4. Reaching the same upper limit with fully coherent searches would have required a number of trials more than two orders of magnitude larger. We also applied the same algorithm to an optical observation of a system containing a known pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, ignoring the refined knowledge of the orbital parameters that was allowed by the identification of the pulsar itself in the radio band: through this analysis, we proved that detection of the pulsar would have followed even with data in the optical band alone.</description>

      <title>Supervised Machine Learning Methods with Uncertainty Quantification for Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals from Transmission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission spectroscopy, while well understood and widely used, are generally computationally expensive. In the era of the JWST and other upcoming observatories, machine learning approaches have emerged as viable alternatives that are both efficient and robust. In this paper we present a systematic study of several existing machine learning regression techniques and compare their performance for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission spectra. We benchmark the performance of the different algorithms on the accuracy, precision, and speed. The regression methods tested here include partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), voting (VOTE), stacking (STACK), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We also investigate the impact of different preprocessing methods of the training data on the model performance. We quantify the model uncertainties across the entire dynamical range of planetary parameters. The best performing combination of ML model and preprocessing scheme is validated on a the case study of JWST observation of WASP-39b.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes with an effective-one-body template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational wave astronomy has entered an era of routine detections, it becomes increasingly important to precisely measure the physical parameters of individual events and infer population properties. Eccentricity is a key observable, suggesting that binaries form in a dense stellar environment through dynamical encounters. This work performs the first matched-filtering search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes (BBHs) covering the mass range $[5, 200]~M_\odot$ and eccentricity at 20 Hz up to 0.5 with a newly developed effective-one-body waveform model. Throughout the third observation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a false alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported in the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates between once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection campaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline. Assuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous searches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs in the mass range [5, 30] $M_\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\odot$ BBH with eccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume compared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without using templates.</description>

      <title>DAWN. I. Simulating the formation and early evolution of stellar clusters with Phantom N-Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is numerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and their surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims. This paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early stellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework which is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling statistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics community, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been added to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded cluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star formation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is consistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region expansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run testcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from the cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their function by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel implementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that massive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics of the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and the strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the cloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming low-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical studies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient simulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the statistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of embedded star clusters.</description>

      <title>Synthesizer: a Software Package for Synthetic Astronomical Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables. The code is publicly available at https://synthesizer-project.github.io/</description>

      <title>Mitigating Eddington and Malmquist Biases in Latent-Inclination Inference of the Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tully-Fisher relation is a vital distance indicator, but its precise inference is challenged by selection bias, statistical bias, and uncertain inclination corrections. This study presents a Bayesian framework that simultaneously addresses these issues. To eliminate the need for individual inclination corrections, inclination is treated as a latent variable with a known probability distribution. To correct for the distance-dependent Malmqvist bias arising from sample selection, the model incorporates Gaussian scatter in the dependent variable, the distribution of the independent variable, and the observational selection function into the data likelihood. To mitigate the statistical bias -- termed the ``general Eddington bias'' -- caused by Gaussian scatter and the non-uniform distribution of the independent variable, two methods are introduced: (1) analytical bias corrections applied to the dependent variable before likelihood computation, and (2) a dual-scatter model that accounts for Gaussian scatter in the independent variable within the likelihood function. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using simulated datasets. By rigorously addressing selection and statistical biases in a latent-variable regression analysis, this work provides a robust approach for unbiased distance estimates from standardizable candles, which is critical for improving the accuracy of Hubble constant determinations.</description>

      <title>Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) for heliospheric imager data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are space weather phenomena capable of causing significant disruptions to both space- and ground-based infrastructure. The timely and accurate detection and prediction of CMEs is a crucial steps towards implementing strategies to minimize the impacts of such events. CMEs are commonly observed using coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HIs), with some forecasting methods relying on manually tracking CMEs across successive images in order to provide an estimate of their arrival time and speed. This process is time-consuming and results may exhibiting considerable interpersonal variation.
  We investigate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to the problem of automated CME detection, focusing on data from the HI instruments aboard the STEREO spacecraft. HI data facilitates the tracking of CMEs through interplanetary space, providing valuable information on their evolution. Building on advances in image segmentation, we present the Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) model. STRUDL is designed to automatically detect and segment CME fronts in HI data. We address the challenges inherent to this task and evaluate the model's performance across a range of solar activity conditions. To complement segmentation, we implement a basic tracking algorithm that links CME detections across successive frames, thus allowing us to automatically generate time-distance profiles.
  Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying ML-based segmentation techniques to HI data, while highlighting areas for future improvement, particularly regarding the accurate segmentation and tracking of faint and interacting CMEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.</description>
