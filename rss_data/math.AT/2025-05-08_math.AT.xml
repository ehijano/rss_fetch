      <title>Nishida Relations in Bordism and Homology (extended abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second of a series of Compte Rendus. In the first [1] we have presented a theory of Dyer-Lashof operations in unoriented bordism. Here we shall discuss the (Nishida) relations between Dyer-Lashof and Landweber-Novikov operations. They are used to represent the algebra $N_*\Sigma$ of covering manifolds in terms of their homology characteristic numbers. The proofs are based on the properties of the covering space operations and the notions of D-ring and Q-ring introduced in [1].</description>

      <title>Combination of open covers with $\pi_1$-constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let~$G$ be a group and let~$\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subgroups of~$G$. The generalised Lusternik--Schnirelmann category~$\operatorname{cat}_\mathcal{F}(G)$ is the minimal cardinality of covers of~$BG$ by open subsets with fundamental group in~$\mathcal{F}$. We prove a combination theorem for~$\operatorname{cat}_\mathcal{F}(G)$ in terms of the stabilisers of contractible $G$-CW-complexes. As applications for the amenable category, we obtain vanishing results for the simplicial volume of gluings of manifolds (along not necessarily amenable boundaries) and of cyclic branched coverings. Moreover, we deduce an upper bound for Farber's topological complexity, generalising an estimate for amalgamated products of Dranishnikov--Sadykov.</description>

      <title>Correction to: Curvature growth of some 4-dimensional gradient Ricci soliton singularity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note corrects an error in the proof of Proposition 13 in arXiv:1903.09181 and simultaneously establishes a more general result. We prove that if $M$ is a compact 4-manifold with boundary $\partial M$ a rational homology 3-sphere, and if an unbounded number of disjoint copies of $M$ embed in a compact 4-manifold $N$, then $H_1(\partial M;\mathbb{Z})$ is a direct double. This partially generalizes a theorem of Hantzsche in the case of rational homology 3-spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the calculations of cellular $\mathbb{A}^1$-homology for smooth toric varieties, along with an explicit description of pure shellable cases. Consequently, we derive the (Milnor-Witt) motivic decomposition for these pure shellable cases. Furthermore, we obtain an additive basis for the Chow groups of general smooth toric varieties.</description>

      <title>The Deligne-Mumford operad as a trivialization of the circle action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.10734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the tree-like Deligne-Mumford operad is a homotopical model for the trivialization of the circle in the higher-genus framed little discs operad. Our proof is based on a geometric argument involving nodal annuli. We use as a model for the higher-genus framed little discs an operad of Riemann surfaces with analytically parametrized boundary. We develop the formalism of topological moduli problems as a framework to accommodate the orbifold nature of the Deligne-Mumford operad.</description>

      <title>Functor calculus via non-cubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study versions of Goodwillie's calculus of functors for indexing diagrams other than cubes. We in particular construct universal excisive approximations for a larger class of diagrams, which yields an extension of the Taylor tower. We prove that the limit of this extension agrees with the limit of the Taylor tower using criteria for the existence of maps between excisive approximations. Lastly we investigate in which cases our new notions of excision coincide with classical ones.</description>

      <title>Absolute algebras, contramodules, and duality squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absolute algebras are a new type of algebraic structures, endowed with a meaningful notion of infinite sums of operations without supposing any underlying topology. Opposite to the usual definition of operadic calculus, they are defined as algebras over cooperads. The goal of this article is to develop this new theory. First, we relate the homotopy theory of absolute algebras to the homotopy theory of usual algebras via a duality square. It intertwines bar-cobar adjunctions with linear duality adjunctions. In particular, we show that linear duality functors between types of coalgebras and types of algebras are Quillen functors and that they induce equivalences between objects with finiteness conditions on their homology. We give general comparison results between absolute types of algebras and their classical counterparts. We work out examples of this theory such as absolute associative algebras and absolute Lie algebras, and show that it includes the theory of contramodules. Campos--Petersen--Robert-Nicoud--Wierstra showed that two nilpotent Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are isomorphic as associative algebras must be isomorphic. As an application of our results, we generalize their theorem to the setting of absolute Lie algebras and absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Higher structures in rational homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes are based on a series of three lectures given (online) by the first named author at the workshop "Higher Structures and Operadic Calculus" at CRM Barcelona in June 2021. The aim is to give a concise introduction to rational homotopy theory through the lens of higher structures.
  The rational homotopy type of a simply connected space of finite type is modeled by a $C_\infty$-algebra structure on the rational cohomology groups, or alternatively an $L_\infty$-algebra structure on the rational homotopy groups. The first lecture is devoted to explaining these models and their relation to the classical models of Quillen and Sullivan.
  The second lecture discusses the relation between Koszul algebras, formality and coformality. The main result is that a space is formal if and only if the rational homotopy $L_\infty$-algebra is Koszul and, dually, a space is coformal if and only if the cohomology $C_\infty$-algebra is Koszul. For spaces that are both formal and coformal, this collapses to classical Koszul duality between Lie and commutative algebras.
  In the third lecture, we discuss certain higher structure in the rational homotopy theory of automorphisms of high dimensional manifolds, discovered by Berglund and Madsen. The higher structure in question is Kontsevich's Lie graph complex and variants of it.</description>

      <title>Topology and Diffeology via Metric-like Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates spaces equipped with a family of metric-like functions satisfying certain axioms. These functions provide a unified framework for defining topology, uniformity, and diffeology. The framework is based on a family of metric-like functions originally introduced for spaces of submanifolds. We show that the topologies, uniformities, and diffeologies of these spaces can be systematically derived from the proposed axioms. Furthermore, the framework covers examples such as spaces with compact-open topologies, tiling spaces, and spaces of graphs, which have appeared in different contexts. These results support the study of spaces with metric-like structures from both topological and diffeological perspectives.</description>
