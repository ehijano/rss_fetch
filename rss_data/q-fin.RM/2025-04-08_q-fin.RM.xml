      <title>Coherent risk measures and uniform integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a profound connection between coherent risk measures, a prominent object in quantitative finance, and uniform integrability, a fundamental concept in probability theory. Instead of working with absolute values of random variables, which is convenient in studying integrability, we work directly with random loses and gains, which have clear financial interpretation. We introduce a technical tool called the folding score of distortion risk measures. The analysis of the folding score allows us to convert some conditions on absolute values to those on gains and losses. As our main results, we obtain three sets of equivalent conditions for uniform integrability. In particular, a set is uniformly integrable if and only if one can find a coherent distortion risk measure that is bounded on the set, but not finite on $L^1$.</description>

      <title>Quantifying firm-level risks from nature deterioration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the loss of value that companies might suffer from nature overexploitation. We find that global equities shed 26.8% in a scenario of unabated nature decline, while the worst-performing firms lose ~75% of their value. Our risk framework considers five environmental hazards: biodiversity loss, land degradation, climate change, human population and nature capital. We also introduce two metrics to assess nature-related risks: a Country Degradation Index that tracks the damage caused by environmental hazards in specific territories, including nonlinear dynamics and tipping points; and a Nature Risk Score that summarizes the risk that companies face due to the decline of nature and its services.</description>

      <title>Interconnected Markets: Exploring the Dynamic Relationship Between BRICS Stock Markets and Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to examine the intricate dynamics between BRICS traditional stock assets and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. Using a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model (TVP-VAR), we have analyzed data from the BRICS stock market index, cryptocurrencies, and indicators from January 6, 2015, to June 29, 2023. The results show that three out of the five BRICS stock markets serve as primary sources of shocks that subsequently affect the financial network. The transcontinental (TCI) value derived from the dynamic conditional connectedness using the TVP-VAR model demonstrates a higher explanatory power than the static connectedness observed using the standard VAR model. The discoveries from this study offer valuable insights for corporations, investors, and regulators concerning systematic risk and investment strategies.</description>

      <title>A note on Refracted Skew Brownian Motion with an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For refracted skew Brownian motion (skew Brownian motion with two-valued drift), adopting a perturbation approach we find expressions of its potential densities. As applications, we recover its transition density and study its long-time asymptotic behaviors. In addition, we also compare with previous results on transition densities for skew Brownian motions. We propose two approaches for generating quasi-random samples by approximating the cumulative distribution function and discuss their risk measurement application.</description>
