      <title>Reverse Degree-Based Topological Indices and QSPR Analysis of Cancer Drugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological index of a graph $G$ is a numerical quantity that describes its topology. Reverse degree-based topological indices play an important role in finding topological descriptors. Azacitidine, Decitabine, and Guadecitabine are hypomethylating agents which are used for the treatment of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia which are not suitable for in-depth treatments such as induction chemotherapy. In this article, some reverse degree-based topological indices of the three said drugs are computed. Furthermore, QSPR analysis of the said topological indices is discussed and it is shown that these topological indices are highly correlated with the physical properties of the three cancer drugs. These findings may help chemists and people working in the pharmaceutical industry to predict the properties of cancer drugs without experimenting.</description>

      <title>IDP-Bert: Predicting Properties of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) constitute a large and structure-less class of proteins with significant functions. The existence of IDPs challenges the conventional notion that the biological functions of proteins rely on their three-dimensional structures. Despite lacking well-defined spatial arrangements, they exhibit diverse biological functions, influencing cellular processes and shedding light on the disease mechanisms. However, it is expensive to run experiments or simulations to characterize this class of proteins. Consequently, we designed an ML model that relies solely on amino acid sequences. In this study, we introduce IDP-Bert model, a deep-learning architecture leveraging Transformers and Protein Language Models (PLMs) to map sequences directly to IDPs properties. Our experiments demonstrate accurate predictions of IDPs properties, including Radius of Gyration, end-to-end Decorrelation Time, and Heat Capacity.</description>

      <title>Expanding Chemical Representation with k-mers and Fragment-based Fingerprints for Molecular Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach, combining substruct counting, $k$-mers, and Daylight-like fingerprints, to expand the representation of chemical structures in SMILES strings. The integrated method generates comprehensive molecular embeddings that enhance discriminative power and information content. Experimental evaluations demonstrate its superiority over traditional Morgan fingerprinting, MACCS, and Daylight fingerprint alone, improving chemoinformatics tasks such as drug classification. The proposed method offers a more informative representation of chemical structures, advancing molecular similarity analysis and facilitating applications in molecular design and drug discovery. It presents a promising avenue for molecular structure analysis and design, with significant potential for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>FABind+: Enhancing Molecular Docking through Improved Pocket Prediction and Pose Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, these methods are often slow and costly. The advent of deep learning-based approaches has shown significant promise, offering increases in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an enhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and propose a novel methodology that significantly refines pocket prediction, thereby streamlining the docking process. Furthermore, we introduce modifications to the docking module to enhance its pose generation capabilities. In an effort to bridge the gap with conventional sampling/generative methods, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a confidence model, requiring only minor adjustments to the regression framework of FABind. Experimental results and analysis reveal that FABind+ remarkably outperforms the original FABind, achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance, and delivers insightful modeling strategies. This demonstrates FABind+ represents a substantial step forward in molecular docking and drug discovery. Our code is in https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind.</description>

      <title>Mol-AIR: Molecular Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Intrinsic Rewards for Goal-directed Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing techniques for discovering molecular structures with desired properties is crucial in artificial intelligence(AI)-based drug discovery. Combining deep generative models with reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective strategy for generating molecules with specific properties. Despite its potential, this approach is ineffective in exploring the vast chemical space and optimizing particular chemical properties. To overcome these limitations, we present Mol-AIR, a reinforcement learning-based framework using adaptive intrinsic rewards for effective goal-directed molecular generation. Mol-AIR leverages the strengths of both history-based and learning-based intrinsic rewards by exploiting random distillation network and counting-based strategies. In benchmark tests, Mol-AIR demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches in generating molecules with desired properties without any prior knowledge, including penalized LogP, QED, and celecoxib similarity. We believe that Mol-AIR represents a significant advancement in drug discovery, offering a more efficient path to discovering novel therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Fossil and present-day stromatolite ooids contain a meteoritic polymer of glycine and iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hemoglycin, a space polymer of glycine and iron, has been identified in the carbonaceous chondritic meteorites Allende, Acfer 086, Kaba, Sutters Mill and Orgueil. Its core form has a mass of 1494Da and is basically an antiparallel pair of polyglycine strands linked at each end by an iron atom. The polymer forms two- and three- dimensional lattices with an inter-vertex distance of 4.9nm. Here the extraction technique for meteorites is applied to a 2.1Gya fossil stromatolite to reveal the presence of hemoglycin by mass spectrometry. Intact ooids from a recent (3,000Ya) stromatolite exhibited the same visible hemoglycin fluorescence in response to x-rays as an intact crystal from the Orgueil meteorite. X-ray analysis confirmed the existence in ooids of an internal 3-dimensional lattice of 4.9nm inter-vertex spacing, matching the spacing of lattices in meteoritic crystals. FTIR measurements of acid-treated ooid and a Sutters Mill meteoritic crystal both show the presence, via the splitting of the Amide I band, of an extended anti-parallel beta sheet structure. It seems probable that the copious in-fall of carbonaceous meteoritic material, from Archaean times onward, has left traces of hemoglycin in sedimentary carbonates and potentially has influenced ooid formation.</description>
