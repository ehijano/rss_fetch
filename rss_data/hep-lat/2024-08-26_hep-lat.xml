      <title>Parton Distribution Function of a Deuteron-like Dibaryon System from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a lattice QCD calculation of the parton distribution function (PDF) of a deuteron-like dibaryon system using large-momentum effective theory. The calculation is done on three Wilson Clover ensembles with a fixed lattice spacing a=0.105 fm and two pion masses. The lattice matrix elements are computed at proton momenta up to 2.46 GeV with the signal of high momentum modes being improved by applying the momentum smearing technique. The state-of-the-art renormalization, matching and extrapolation are then applied to obtain the final result of the light-cone PDF. A comparison between the result of the dibaryon system and the sum of the proton and neutron PDFs is also given.</description>

      <title>Colour-electric and colour-magnetic confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic properties of the confinement mechanism in QCD -- the temperature dependence of the spatial and temporal string tensions ($\sigma_s(T)$ and $\sigma_E(T)$) -- are studied in the framework of the Field Correlator Method (FCM). It is shown that both functions are connected respectively to the spatial and temporal parts of the vacuum gluon energy $\epsilon_s$ and $\epsilon_E$ which define their equal values at $T=0$. However at $T&gt;0$ the spatial part is growing with $T$ while the temporal part is destroyed by the hadronic pressure at $T=T_c$ (the deconfinement). Both properties are derived within the same method and are in a good agreement with the corresponding lattice data.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Constructed Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE in the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements of simulating periodic systems on quantum computers, we develop a new approach, (SC)$^2$-ADAPT-VQE, to further advance the simulation of these systems. Our approach extends the scalable circuits ADAPT-VQE framework, which builds an ansatz from a pool of coordinate-invariant operators defined for arbitrarily large, though not arbitrarily small, volumes. Our method uses a classically tractable ``Surrogate Constructed'' method to remove irrelevant operators from the pool, reducing the minimum size for which the scalable circuits are defined. Bringing together the scalable circuits and the surrogate constructed approaches forms the core of the (SC)$^2$ methodology. Our approach allows for a wider set of classical computations, on small volumes, which can be used for a more robust extrapolation protocol. While developed in the context of lattice models, the surrogate construction portion is applicable to a wide variety of problems where information about the relative importance of operators in the pool is available. As an example, we use it to compute properties of the Schwinger model - quantum electrodynamics for a single, massive fermion in $1+1$ dimensions - and show that our method can be used to accurately extrapolate to the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the resonance X(4630) at non-zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spectroscopic parameters of resonance $X(4630)$ observed in the process $B^{+}\rightarrow J/\Psi \phi K^{+}$ by at the LHCb experiments at CERN by means of thermal QCD sum rule method at non-zero temperature. The exotic vector $X(4630)$ is assigned as the diquark-antidiquark state $[cs][\overline{cs}]$ with spin-parity $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$. Employing the two-point QCD sum rule approach up to the sixth order of the operator dimension by including non-perturbative contribution, we calculate the mass and decay constant of $X(4630)$ at $T\neq0$. The numerical analyses demonstrate that the values of the mass and decay constant of $X(4630)$ near the deconfinement temperature decrease up to $9.8\%$ and $60\%$ of their vacuum values. At $T\rightarrow0$, the obtained results for the mass $m_{X(4630)}=(4649\pm40)$ MeV and decay constant $\lambda_{X(4630)}=(10.07\pm0.8)\times10^{-3} $ MeV are in excellent agreement with the results reported by LHCb experiments and other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Study of the effects of external imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential on quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of quark matter with both external electric field and chiral chemical potential is theoretically and experimentally interesting to consider. In this paper, the case of simultaneous presence of imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential is investigated using the lattice QCD approach with $N_f=1+1$ dynamical staggered fermions. We find that overall both the imaginary electric field and the chiral chemical potential can exacerbate chiral symmetry breaking, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. However we also find a non-monotonic behavior of chiral condensation at specific electric field strengths and chiral chemical potentials. In addition to this, we find that the behavior of Polyakov loop in the complex plane is not significantly affected by chiral chemical potential in the region of the parameters consider in this paper.</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>
