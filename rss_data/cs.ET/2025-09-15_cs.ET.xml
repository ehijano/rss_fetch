      <title>SoilSound: Smartphone-based Soil Moisture Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil moisture monitoring is essential for agriculture and environmental management, yet existing methods require either invasive probes disturbing the soil or specialized equipment, limiting access to the public. We present SoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system that can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the built-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to accurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that use transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic reflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture sensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic chirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan, which are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for on-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or power overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes in the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the evaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels ranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and users; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling widespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen scientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Analog Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Interference-Based Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider analog over-the-air federated learning, where devices harvest energy from in-band and out-band radio frequency signals, with the former also causing co-channel interference (CCI). To mitigate the aggregation error, we propose an effective denoising policy that does not require channel state information (CSI). We also propose an adaptive scheduling algorithm that dynamically adjusts the number of local training epochs based on available energy, enhancing device participation and learning performance while reducing energy consumption. Simulation results and convergence analysis confirm the robust performance of the algorithm compared to conventional methods. It is shown that the performance of the proposed denoising method is comparable to that of conventional CSI-based methods. It is observed that high-power CCI severely degrades the learning performance, which can be mitigated by increasing the number of active devices, achievable via the adaptive algorithm.</description>

      <title>Echo State and Band-pass Networks with aqueous memristors: leaky reservoir computing with a leaky substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are extensively employed for processing sequential data such as time series. Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive platform for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. We accomplish this by employing established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Efficient Motion Sickness Assessment: Recreation of On-Road Driving on a Compact Test Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to engage in other activities during the ride is considered by consumers as one of the key reasons for the adoption of automated vehicles. However, engagement in non-driving activities will provoke occupants' motion sickness, deteriorating their overall comfort and thereby risking acceptance of automated driving. Therefore, it is critical to extend our understanding of motion sickness and unravel the modulating factors that affect it through experiments with participants. Currently, most experiments are conducted on public roads (realistic but not reproducible) or test tracks (feasible with prototype automated vehicles). This research study develops a method to design an optimal path and speed reference to efficiently replicate on-road motion sickness exposure on a small test track. The method uses model predictive control to replicate the longitudinal and lateral accelerations collected from on-road drives on a test track of 70 m by 175 m. A within-subject experiment (47 participants) was conducted comparing the occupants' motion sickness occurrence in test-track and on-road conditions, with the conditions being cross-randomized. The results illustrate no difference and no effect of the condition on the occurrence of the average motion sickness across the participants. Meanwhile, there is an overall correspondence of individual sickness levels between on-road and test-track. This paves the path for the employment of our method for a simpler, safer and more replicable assessment of motion sickness.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Machine Learning Models for Enhanced Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Advancing Security with Digital Twins: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of electronic devices has greatly transformed every aspect of human life, such as communication, healthcare, transportation, and energy. Unfortunately, the global electronics supply chain is vulnerable to various attacks, including piracy of intellectual properties, tampering, counterfeiting, information leakage, side-channel, and fault injection attacks, due to the complex nature of electronic products and vulnerabilities present in them. Although numerous solutions have been proposed to address these threats, significant gaps remain, particularly in providing scalable and comprehensive protection against emerging attacks. Digital twin, a dynamic virtual replica of a physical system, has emerged as a promising solution to address these issues by providing backward traceability, end-to-end visibility, and continuous verification of component integrity and behavior. In this paper, we comprehensively present the latest digital twin-based security implementations, including their role in cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, cryptographic systems, detection of counterfeit electronics, intrusion detection, fault injection, and side-channel leakage. This work considers these critical security use cases within a single study to offer researchers and practitioners a unified reference for securing hardware with digital twins. The paper also explores the integration of large language models with digital twins for enhanced security and discusses current challenges, solutions, and future research directions.</description>
