      <title>The Genetic Code Paradox: Extreme Conservation Despite Demonstrated Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal genetic code presents a fundamental paradox in molecular biology. Recent advances in synthetic biology have demonstrated that the code is remarkably flexible--organisms can survive with 61 codons instead of 64, natural variants have reassigned codons 38+ times, and fitness costs of recoding stem primarily from secondary mutations rather than code changes themselves. Yet despite billions of years of evolution and this proven flexibility, approximately 99% of life maintains an identical 64-codon genetic code. This extreme conservation cannot be fully explained by current evolutionary theory, which predicts far more variation given the demonstrated viability of alternatives. I propose that this paradox--evolutionary flexibility coupled with mysterious conservation--reveals unrecognized constraints on biological information systems. This paper presents testable predictions to distinguish between competing explanations: extreme network effects, hidden optimization parameters, or potentially, computational architecture constraints that transcend standard evolutionary pressures.</description>

      <title>Universal features of epidemic and vaccine models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model that includes an additional immigration process. In the presence of multiplicative noise, generated by environmental perturbations, the model exhibits noise-induced transitions. The bifurcation diagram has two distinct regions of unimodality and bimodality in which the steady-state probability distribution has one and two peaks, respectively. Apart from first-order transitions between the two regimes, a critical-point transition occurs at a cusp point with the transition belonging to the mean-field Ising universality class. The epidemic model shares these features with the well-known Horsthemke-Lefever model of population genetics. The effect of vaccination on the spread/containment of the epidemic in a stochastic setting is also studied. We further propose a general vaccine-hesitancy model, along the lines of Kirman's ant model, with the steady-state distribution of the fraction of the vaccine-willing population given by the Beta distribution. The distribution is shown to give a good fit to the COVID-19 data on vaccine hesitancy and vaccination. We derive the steady-state probability distribution of the basic reproduction number, a key parameter in epidemiology, based on a beta-distributed fraction of the vaccinated population. Our study highlights the universal features that epidemic and vaccine models share with other dynamical models.</description>

      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating nationwide coupled disease and fear spread in an agent-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human cognitive responses, behavioral responses, and disease dynamics co-evolve over the course of any disease outbreak, and can result in complex feedbacks. We present a dynamic agent-based model that explicitly couples the spread of disease with the spread of fear surrounding the disease, implemented within the EpiCast simulation framework. EpiCast models transmission across a realistic synthetic population, capturing individual-level interactions. In our model, fear propagates through both in-person contact and broadcast media, prompting individuals to adopt protective behaviors that reduce disease spread. In order to better understand these coupled dynamics, we create and compare a range of compartmental surrogate models to analyze the impact of including various disease states. Additionally, we compare a range of behavioral scenarios within EpiCast, varying the level and intensity of fear and behavioral change. Our results show that the addition of asymptomatic, exposed, and pre-symptomatic disease states can impact both the rate at which an outbreak progresses and its overall trajectory. Moreover, the combination of non-local fear spread via broadcasters and strong behavioral responses by fearful individuals generally leads to multiple epidemic waves, an outcome that occurs only within a narrow parameter range when fear spreads purely through local contact. Accounting for the coupled spread of fear and disease is critical for understanding disease dynamics and designing timely, targeted responses to emerging infectious threats.</description>
