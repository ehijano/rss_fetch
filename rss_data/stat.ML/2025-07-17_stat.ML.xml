      <title>LLMs are Bayesian, in Expectation, not in Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable in-context learning capabilities, adapting to new tasks without parameter updates. While this phenomenon has been successfully modeled as implicit Bayesian inference, recent empirical findings reveal a fundamental contradiction: transformers systematically violate the martingale property, a cornerstone requirement of Bayesian updating on exchangeable data. This violation challenges the theoretical foundations underlying uncertainty quantification in critical applications.
  Our theoretical analysis establishes four key results: (1) positional encodings induce martingale violations of order $\Theta(\log n / n)$; (2) transformers achieve information-theoretic optimality with excess risk $O(n^{-1/2})$ in expectation over orderings; (3) the implicit posterior representation converges to the true Bayesian posterior in the space of sufficient statistics; and (4) we derive the optimal chain-of-thought length as $k^* = \Theta(\sqrt{n}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ with explicit constants, providing a principled approach to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance. Empirical validation on GPT-3 confirms predictions (1)-(3), with transformers reaching 99\% of theoretical entropy limits within 20 examples. Our framework provides practical methods for extracting calibrated uncertainty estimates from position-aware architectures and optimizing computational efficiency in deployment.</description>

      <title>Choosing the Better Bandit Algorithm under Data Sharing: When Do A/B Experiments Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study A/B experiments that are designed to compare the performance of two recommendation algorithms. Prior work has shown that the standard difference-in-means estimator is biased in estimating the global treatment effect (GTE) due to a particular form of interference between experimental units. Specifically, units under the treatment and control algorithms contribute to a shared pool of data that subsequently train both algorithms, resulting in interference between the two groups. The bias arising from this type of data sharing is known as "symbiosis bias". In this paper, we highlight that, for decision-making purposes, the sign of the GTE often matters more than its precise magnitude when selecting the better algorithm. We formalize this insight under a multi-armed bandit framework and theoretically characterize when the sign of the expected GTE estimate under data sharing aligns with or contradicts the sign of the true GTE. Our analysis identifies the level of exploration versus exploitation as a key determinant of how symbiosis bias impacts algorithm selection.</description>

      <title>Newfluence: Boosting Model interpretability and Understanding in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models has created a pressing need for tools that help scientists, engineers, and policymakers interpret and refine model decisions and predictions. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, have emerged as a popular approach for this purpose.
  However, the heuristic foundations of influence functions rely on low-dimensional assumptions where the number of parameters $p$ is much smaller than the number of observations $n$. In contrast, modern AI models often operate in high-dimensional regimes with large $p$, challenging these assumptions.
  In this paper, we examine the accuracy of influence functions in high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that influence functions cannot reliably fulfill their intended purpose. We then introduce an alternative approximation, called Newfluence, that maintains similar computational efficiency while offering significantly improved accuracy.
  Newfluence is expected to provide more accurate insights than many existing methods for interpreting complex AI models and diagnosing their issues. Moreover, the high-dimensional framework we develop in this paper can also be applied to analyze other popular techniques, such as Shapley values.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Fairness Constraints into Archetypal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Archetypal Analysis (AA) is an unsupervised learning method that represents data as convex combinations of extreme patterns called archetypes. While AA provides interpretable and low-dimensional representations, it can inadvertently encode sensitive attributes, leading to fairness concerns. In this work, we propose Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA), a modified formulation that explicitly reduces the influence of sensitive group information in the learned projections. We also introduce FairKernelAA, a nonlinear extension that addresses fairness in more complex data distributions. Our approach incorporates a fairness regularization term while preserving the structure and interpretability of the archetypes. We evaluate FairAA and FairKernelAA on synthetic datasets, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-group scenarios, demonstrating their ability to reduce group separability -- as measured by mean maximum discrepancy and linear separability -- without substantially compromising explained variance. We further validate our methods on the real-world ANSUR I dataset, confirming their robustness and practical utility. The results show that FairAA achieves a favorable trade-off between utility and fairness, making it a promising tool for responsible representation learning in sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Uncertainty-Aware Virtual Sensing via Conformalized Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains. Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Adversarial Preferences in Tabular MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs (PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the numerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead observes preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices being compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the reward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a regret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we present a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ for episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is the number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret lower bound of $\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda scores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that achieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global optimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all occupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from suboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and computational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization algorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the unknown-transition setting.</description>

      <title>Model averaging in the space of probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the problem of model averaging in the context of measure-valued data. Specifically, we study aggregation schemes in the space of probability distributions metrized in terms of the Wasserstein distance. The resulting aggregate models, defined via Wasserstein barycenters, are optimally calibrated to empirical data. To enhance model performance, we employ regularization schemes motivated by the standard elastic net penalization, which is shown to consistently yield models enjoying sparsity properties. The consistency properties of the proposed averaging schemes with respect to sample size are rigorously established using the variational framework of $\Gamma$-convergence. The performance of the methods is evaluated through carefully designed synthetic experiments that assess behavior across a range of distributional characteristics and stress conditions. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a real-world dataset of insurance losses - characterized by heavy-tailed behavior - to estimate the claim size distribution and the associated tail risk.</description>

      <title>Approaching Optimality for Solving Dense Linear Systems with Low-Rank Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new high-accuracy randomized algorithms for solving linear systems and regression problems that are well-conditioned except for $k$ large singular values. For solving such $d \times d$ positive definite system our algorithms succeed whp. and run in time $\tilde O(d^2 + k^\omega)$. For solving such regression problems in a matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ our methods succeed whp. and run in time $\tilde O(\mathrm{nnz}(\mathbf{A}) + d^2 + k^\omega)$ where $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent and $\mathrm{nnz}(\mathbf{A})$ is the number of non-zeros in $\mathbf{A}$. Our methods nearly-match a natural complexity limit under dense inputs for these problems and improve upon a trade-off in prior approaches that obtain running times of either $\tilde O(d^{2.065}+k^\omega)$ or $\tilde O(d^2 + dk^{\omega-1})$ for $d\times d$ systems. Moreover, we show how to obtain these running times even under the weaker assumption that all but $k$ of the singular values have a suitably bounded generalized mean. Consequently, we give the first nearly-linear time algorithm for computing a multiplicative approximation to the nuclear norm of an arbitrary dense matrix. Our algorithms are built on three general recursive preconditioning frameworks, where matrix sketching and low-rank update formulas are carefully tailored to the problems' structure.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Powered by Encoder Embedding for Improved Node Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines. These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.</description>

      <title>Fiducial Matching: Differentially Private Inference for Categorical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of statistical inference, which includes the building of confidence intervals and tests for parameters and effects of interest to a researcher, is still an open area of investigation in a differentially private (DP) setting. Indeed, in addition to the randomness due to data sampling, DP delivers another source of randomness consisting of the noise added to protect an individual's data from being disclosed to a potential attacker. As a result of this convolution of noises, in many cases it is too complicated to determine the stochastic behavior of the statistics and parameters resulting from a DP procedure. In this work, we contribute to this line of investigation by employing a simulation-based matching approach, solved through tools from the fiducial framework, which aims to replicate the data generation pipeline (including the DP step) and retrieve an approximate distribution of the estimates resulting from this pipeline. For this purpose, we focus on the analysis of categorical (nominal) data that is common in national surveys, for which sensitivity is naturally defined, and on additive privacy mechanisms. We prove the validity of the proposed approach in terms of coverage and highlight its good computational and statistical performance for different inferential tasks in simulated and applied data settings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Bandits: Almost Optimal Regret with One-Pass Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD) estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator, even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient optimistic method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Signal Proportion Estimation Through Leveraging Arbitrary Covariance Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the proportion of true signals among a large number of variables is crucial for enhancing the precision and reliability of scientific research. Traditional signal proportion estimators often assume independence among variables and specific signal sparsity conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where such assumptions may not hold. This paper introduces a novel signal proportion estimator that leverages arbitrary covariance dependence information among variables, thereby improving performance across a wide range of sparsity levels and dependence structures. Building on previous work that provides lower confidence bounds for signal proportions, we extend this approach by incorporating the principal factor approximation procedure to account for variable dependence. Our theoretical insights offer a deeper understanding of how signal sparsity, signal intensity, and covariance dependence interact. By comparing the conditions for estimation consistency before and after dependence adjustment, we highlight the advantages of integrating dependence information across different contexts. This theoretical foundation not only validates the effectiveness of the new estimator but also guides its practical application, ensuring reliable use in diverse scenarios. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art estimators in both estimation accuracy and the detection of weaker signals that might otherwise go undetected.</description>

      <title>Designing Algorithms for Entropic Optimal Transport from an Optimisation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a collection of novel methods for the entropic-regularised optimal transport problem, which are inspired by existing mirror descent interpretations of the Sinkhorn algorithm used for solving this problem. These are fundamentally proposed from an optimisation perspective: either based on the associated semi-dual problem, or based on solving a non-convex constrained problem over subset of joint distributions. This optimisation viewpoint results in non-asymptotic rates of convergence for the proposed methods under minimal assumptions on the problem structure. We also propose a momentum-equipped method with provable accelerated guarantees through this viewpoint, akin to those in the Euclidean setting. The broader framework we develop based on optimisation over the joint distributions also finds an analogue in the dynamical Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.</description>

      <title>Fast Variational Bayes for Large Spatial Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent variational Bayes methods for geospatial regression, proposed as an alternative to computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, have leveraged Nearest Neighbor Gaussian processes (NNGP) to achieve scalability. Yet, these variational methods remain inferior in accuracy and speed compared to spNNGP, the state-of-the-art MCMC-based software for NNGP. We introduce spVarBayes, a suite of fast variational Bayesian approaches for large-scale geospatial data analysis using NNGP. Our contributions are primarily computational. We replace auto-differentiation with a combination of calculus of variations, closed-form gradient updates, and linear response corrections for improved variance estimation. We also accommodate covariates (fixed effects) in the model and offer inference on the variance parameters. Simulation experiments demonstrate that we achieve comparable accuracy to spNNGP but with reduced computational costs, and considerably outperform existing variational inference methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. Analysis of a large forest canopy height dataset illustrates the practical implementation of proposed methods and shows that the inference results are consistent with those obtained from the MCMC approach. The proposed methods are implemented in publicly available Github R-package spVarBayes.</description>

      <title>Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes with Neural Network Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure. Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling for uncertainty quantification in nonlinear dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of complex systems in engineering often involves significant uncertainty about operating conditions, such as external loads, environmental effects, and manufacturing variability. As a result, uncertainty quantification (UQ) has become a critical tool in modeling-based engineering, providing methods to identify, characterize, and propagate uncertainty through computational models. However, the stochastic nature of UQ typically requires numerous evaluations of these models, which can be computationally expensive and limit the scope of feasible analyses. To address this, surrogate models, i.e., efficient functional approximations trained on a limited set of simulations, have become central in modern UQ practice. This book chapter presents a concise review of surrogate modeling techniques for UQ, with a focus on the particularly challenging task of capturing the full time-dependent response of dynamical systems. It introduces a classification of time-dependent problems based on the complexity of input excitation and discusses corresponding surrogate approaches, including combinations of principal component analysis with polynomial chaos expansions, time warping techniques, and nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX models). Each method is illustrated with simple application examples to clarify the underlying ideas and practical use.</description>

      <title>ROC-n-reroll: How verifier imperfection affects test-time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve. Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level of accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different versions of Llama and Qwen to generate and verify solutions.</description>

      <title>Prominent Roles of Conditionally Invariant Components in Domain Adaptation: Theory and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) is a statistical learning problem that arises when the distribution of the source data used to train a model differs from that of the target data used to evaluate the model. While many DA algorithms have demonstrated considerable empirical success, blindly applying these algorithms can often lead to worse performance on new datasets. To address this, it is crucial to clarify the assumptions under which a DA algorithm has good target performance. In this work, we focus on the assumption of the presence of conditionally invariant components (CICs), which are relevant for prediction and remain conditionally invariant across the source and target data. We demonstrate that CICs, which can be estimated through conditional invariant penalty (CIP), play three prominent roles in providing target risk guarantees in DA. First, we propose a new algorithm based on CICs, importance-weighted conditional invariant penalty (IW-CIP), which has target risk guarantees beyond simple settings such as covariate shift and label shift. Second, we show that CICs help identify large discrepancies between source and target risks of other DA algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating CICs into the domain invariant projection (DIP) algorithm can address its failure scenario caused by label-flipping features. We support our new algorithms and theoretical findings via numerical experiments on synthetic data, MNIST, CelebA, Camelyon17, and DomainNet datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Properties of Generative Adversarial Models for Low Intrinsic Data Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the theoretical guarantees for their statistical accuracy remain rather pessimistic. In particular, the data distributions on which GANs are applied, such as natural images, are often hypothesized to have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure in a typically high-dimensional feature space, but this is often not reflected in the derived rates in the state-of-the-art analyses. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of GANs and their bidirectional variant, Bi-directional GANs (BiGANs), by deriving statistical guarantees on the estimated densities in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the data and the latent space. We analytically show that if one has access to $n$ samples from the unknown target distribution and the network architectures are properly chosen, the expected Wasserstein-1 distance of the estimates from the target scales as $O\left( n^{-1/d_\mu } \right)$ for GANs and $\tilde{O}\left( n^{-1/(d_\mu+\ell)} \right)$ for BiGANs, where $d_\mu$ and $\ell$ are the upper Wasserstein-1 dimension of the data-distribution and latent-space dimension, respectively. The theoretical analyses not only suggest that these methods successfully avoid the curse of dimensionality, in the sense that the exponent of $n$ in the error rates does not depend on the data dimension but also serve to bridge the gap between the theoretical analyses of GANs and the known sharp rates from optimal transport literature. Additionally, we demonstrate that GANs can effectively achieve the minimax optimal rate even for non-smooth underlying distributions, with the use of interpolating generator networks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Venn and Venn-Abers Calibration with Applications in Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring model calibration is critical for reliable prediction, yet popular distribution-free methods such as histogram binning and isotonic regression offer only asymptotic guarantees. We introduce a unified framework for Venn and Venn-Abers calibration that extends Vovk's approach beyond binary classification to a broad class of prediction problems defined by generic loss functions. Our method transforms any perfectly in-sample calibrated predictor into a set-valued predictor that, in finite samples, outputs at least one marginally calibrated point prediction. These set predictions shrink asymptotically and converge to a single conditionally calibrated prediction, capturing epistemic uncertainty. We further propose Venn multicalibration, a new approach for achieving finite-sample calibration across subpopulations. For quantile loss, our framework recovers group-conditional and multicalibrated conformal prediction as special cases and yields novel prediction intervals with quantile-conditional coverage.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis of Posterior Sampling-Based Expected Improvement for Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for optimizing an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In particular, the effectiveness of expected improvement (EI) has been demonstrated in a wide range of applications. However, theoretical analyses of EI are limited compared with other theoretically established algorithms. This paper analyzes a randomized variant of EI, which evaluates the EI from the maximum of the posterior sample path. We show that this posterior sampling-based random EI achieves the sublinear Bayesian cumulative regret bounds under the assumption that the black-box function follows a Gaussian process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>From Observational Data to Clinical Recommendations: A Causal Framework for Estimating Patient-level Treatment Effects and Learning Policies</title>

Abstract: We propose a framework for building patient-specific treatment recommendation models, building on the large recent literature on learning patient-level causal models and inspired by the target trial paradigm of Hernan and Robins. We focus on safety and validity, including the crucial issue of causal identification when using observational data. We do not provide a specific model, but rather a way to integrate existing methods and know-how into a practical pipeline. We further provide a real world use-case of treatment optimization for patients with heart failure who develop acute kidney injury during hospitalization. The results suggest our pipeline can improve patient outcomes over the current treatment regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.10455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study computational and statistical consequences of problem geometry in stochastic and online optimization. By focusing on constraint set and gradient geometry, we characterize the problem families for which stochastic- and adaptive-gradient methods are (minimax) optimal and, conversely, when nonlinear updates -- such as those mirror descent employs -- are necessary for optimal convergence. When the constraint set is quadratically convex, diagonally pre-conditioned stochastic gradient methods are minimax optimal. We provide quantitative converses showing that the ``distance'' of the underlying constraints from quadratic convexity determines the sub-optimality of subgradient methods. These results apply, for example, to any $\ell_p$-ball for $p &lt; 2$, and the computation/accuracy tradeoffs they demonstrate exhibit a striking analogy to those in Gaussian sequence models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for particle gradient descent, and extensions of the log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD, Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that the flow converges exponentially fast to the free energy's minimizers for models satisfying a condition that generalizes both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively). We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying the extension to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I extension holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error and obtain the non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features, in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multi-component approach, in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multi-layer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multi-component structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis for Randomized Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) is a theoretically established algorithm for Bayesian optimization (BO), where we assume the objective function $f$ follows a GP. One notable drawback of GP-UCB is that the theoretical confidence parameter $\beta$ increases along with the iterations and is too large. To alleviate this drawback, this paper analyzes the randomized variant of GP-UCB called improved randomized GP-UCB (IRGP-UCB), which uses the confidence parameter generated from the shifted exponential distribution. We analyze the expected regret and conditional expected regret, where the expectation and the probability are taken respectively with $f$ and noise and with the randomness of the BO algorithm. In both regret analyses, IRGP-UCB achieves a sub-linear regret upper bound without increasing the confidence parameter if the input domain is finite. Furthermore, we show that randomization plays a key role in avoiding an increase in confidence parameter by showing that GP-UCB using a constant confidence parameter can incur linearly growing expected cumulative regret. Finally, we show numerical experiments using synthetic and benchmark functions and real-world emulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01008v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tweedie exponential dispersion family is a popular choice among many to model insurance losses that consist of zero-inflated semicontinuous data. In such data, it is often important to obtain credibility (inference) of the most important features that describe the endogenous variables. Post-selection inference is the standard procedure in statistics to obtain confidence intervals of model parameters after performing a feature extraction procedure. For a linear model, the lasso estimate often has non-negligible estimation bias for large coefficients corresponding to exogenous variables. To have valid inference on those coefficients, it is necessary to correct the bias of the lasso estimate. Traditional statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing or standard confidence interval construction might lead to incorrect conclusions during post-selection, as they are generally too optimistic. Here we discuss a few methodologies for constructing confidence intervals of the coefficients after feature selection in the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) family with application to insurance data.</description>

      <title>MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks--and more recently, large models demands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin. The implementation of MARS is available at https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS.</description>

      <title>Variational Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo for Bayesian Phylogenetics in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic space naturally encodes hierarchical structures such as phylogenies (binary trees), where inward-bending geodesics reflect paths through least common ancestors, and the exponential growth of neighborhoods mirrors the super-exponential scaling of topologies. This scaling challenge limits the efficiency of Euclidean-based approximate inference methods. Motivated by the geometric connections between trees and hyperbolic space, we develop novel hyperbolic extensions of two sequential search algorithms: Combinatorial and Nested Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo (\textsc{Csmc} and \textsc{Ncsmc}). Our approach introduces consistent and unbiased estimators, along with variational inference methods (\textsc{H-Vcsmc} and \textsc{H-Vncsmc}), which outperform their Euclidean counterparts. Empirical results demonstrate improved speed, scalability and performance in high-dimensional phylogenetic inference tasks.</description>

      <title>The late-stage training dynamics of (stochastic) subgradient descent on homogeneous neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent (SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent for Non-Homogeneous Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic implicit bias of gradient descent (GD) for generic non-homogeneous deep networks under exponential loss. Specifically, we characterize three key properties of GD iterates starting from a sufficiently small empirical risk, where the threshold is determined by a measure of the network's non-homogeneity. First, we show that a normalized margin induced by the GD iterates increases nearly monotonically. Second, we prove that while the norm of the GD iterates diverges to infinity, the iterates themselves converge in direction. Finally, we establish that this directional limit satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem. Prior works on implicit bias have focused exclusively on homogeneous networks; in contrast, our results apply to a broad class of non-homogeneous networks satisfying a mild near-homogeneity condition. In particular, our results apply to networks with residual connections and non-homogeneous activation functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed by Ji and Telgarsky (2020).</description>

      <title>A Thorough Assessment of the Non-IID Data Impact in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning (ML) model training among decentralized clients' information, ensuring data privacy. The decentralized nature of FL deals with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This open problem has notable consequences, such as decreased model performance and more significant convergence times. Despite its importance, experimental studies systematically addressing all types of data heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IIDness) remain scarce. We aim to fill this gap by assessing and quantifying the non-IID effect through a thorough empirical analysis. We use the Hellinger Distance (HD) to measure differences in distribution among clients. Our study benchmarks four state-of-the-art strategies for handling non-IID data, including label, feature, quantity, and spatiotemporal skewness, under realistic and controlled conditions. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal skew effect in FL. Our findings highlight the significant impact of label and spatiotemporal skew non-IID types on FL model performance, with notable performance drops occurring at specific HD thresholds. Additionally, the FL performance is heavily affected mainly when the non-IIDness is extreme. Thus, we provide recommendations for FL research to tackle data heterogeneity effectively. Our work represents the most extensive examination of non-IIDness in FL, offering a robust foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: Approximation and Learning Guarantees for Functions and their Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.</description>

      <title>NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as learning the transition from the historical function family to the future function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the transition path in function space from the historical function family to the future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead. Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family perspective.</description>
