      <title>From Extraterrestrial Microbes to Alien Intelligence: Rebalancing Astronomical Research Priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the funding disparity in astronomical research priorities: the Habitable Worlds Observatory is planned to receive over $10 billion over the next two decades whereas extraterrestrial intelligence research receives nearly zero federal funding. This imbalance is in contrast to both scientific value and public interest, as 65% of Americans and 58.2% of surveyed astrobiologists believe extraterrestrial intelligence exists. Empirical psychological research demonstrates that humanity possesses greater resilience toward extraterrestrial contact than historically recognized. Contemporary studies reveal adaptive responses rather than mass panic, conflicting with the rationale for excluding extraterrestrial intelligence research from federal funding since 1993. The response to the recent interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exemplifies consequences of this underinvestment: despite discovery forecasts of a new interstellar object every few months for the coming decade, no funded missions exist to intercept or closely study these visitors from outside the Solar System. We propose establishing a comprehensive research program to explore both biosignatures and technosignatures on interstellar objects. This program would address profound public interest while advancing detection capabilities and enabling potentially transformative discoveries in the search for extraterrestrial life. The systematic exclusion of extraterrestrial intelligence research represents institutional bias rather than scientific limitation, requiring immediate reconsideration of funding priorities.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Unsupervised Learning Approach for Large, Multicolor, Photometric Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational astronomy has undergone a significant transformation driven by large-scale surveys, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Gaia Mission. These programs yield large, complex datasets that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, and as a result, many different machine learning techniques are being tested and deployed. We introduce a new approach to analyzing multiband photometry by using a long-short term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE). This model views mean measurements of multicolor photometry as a sequence in wavelength in order to encode patterns present in the stars' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into a two-dimensional latent space. We showcase this by using Pan-STARRS grizy mean magnitudes, and we use globular clusters, labels from SIMBAD, Gaia DR3 parallaxes, and PanSTARRS images to aid our analysis and understanding of the latent space. For 3,112,259 stars in an annulus around the North Galactic Cap, 99.51% have their full SED shape reconstructed--that is the absolute difference between the observed and the model predicted magnitude in every band--within five hundredths of a magnitude. We show that the model likely denoises photometric data, potentially improving the quality of measurements. Lastly, we show that the detection of rare stellar types can be performed by analyzing poorly reconstructed photometry.</description>

      <title>XRISM Pre-Pipeline and Singularity: Container-Based Data Processing for the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission and High-Performance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is the seventh Japanese X-ray observatory whose development and operation are in collaboration with universities and research institutes in Japan, the United States, and Europe, including JAXA, NASA, and ESA. The telemetry data downlinked from the satellite are reduced to scientific products using pre-pipeline (PPL) and pipeline (PL) software running on standard Linux virtual machines (VMs) for the JAXA and NASA sides, respectively. OBSIDs identified the observations, and we had 80 and 161 OBSIDs to be reprocessed at the end of the commissioning period and performance verification and calibration period, respectively. The combination of the containerized PPL utilizing Singularity of a container platform running on the JAXA's "TOKI-RURI" high-performance computing (HPC) system and working disk images formatted to ext3 accomplished a 33x speedup in PPL tasks over our regular VM. Herein, we briefly describe the data processing in XRISM and our porting strategies for PPL in the HPC environment.</description>

      <title>Performance Study of the IceCube Upgrade Camera System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade Camera System is a novel calibration system designed to calibrate the IceCube detector by measuring the optical properties of the Antarctic ice. The system comprises nearly 2,000 cameras and illumination LEDs, which are present on every D-Egg and mDOM, the newly designed optical modules for the IceCube Upgrade. These units, deployed across the IceCube Upgrade volume, will capture transmission and reflection images that can be used to characterize the optical properties of both the refrozen ice within drill holes and the bulk ice between strings. Additionally, the images can aid in determining the positions of the optical modules the camera systems are mounted on. To maximize the systems performance, various image analysis methodologies have been explored, ranging from classical maximum likelihood estimation to AI-based approaches using neural networks. In this study, we present preliminary results on the performance of these methods based on images generated by a simulation tool developed specifically for this system.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Distribution of the Galactic Center Excess' Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources. Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier point-source analyses of the GCE.</description>

      <title>One Year of ASPEX-STEPS Operation: Characteristic Features, Observations and Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS), a subsystem of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) onboard India's Aditya-L1 satellite, is designed to study different aspects of energetic particles in the interplanetary medium from the Sun-Earth L1 point using six detector units oriented in different directions. This article presents details of the one-year operation (08 January 2024 - 28 February 2025) of the AL1-ASPEX-STEPS after the insertion of the satellite into the final halo orbit around the L1 point with emphasis on performance, science observations, and scientific potentials. Four out of six AL1-ASPEX-STEPS units exhibit a stable detector response throughout the observation period, confirming operational robustness. This work also includes the temporal variation of particle fluxes, spectra of ions during selected quiet times and transient events, and cross-comparisons with existing instruments at the L1 point. A strong correlation (with coefficient of determination, R2 ~ 0.9) is observed in the cross-comparison study, establishing the reliability of the AL1- ASPEX-STEPS observations. AL1-ASPEX-STEPS also captures different forms of energetic ion spectra similar to those observed by previous missions. These results underscore the instrument's potential to contribute significantly to the study of energetic particle acceleration, transport, and long-term space weather monitoring from the Sun-Earth L1 vantage point.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Redundancy of Time-Delay Interferometry Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions, as it suppresses laser frequency noise and achieve the required sensitivity. Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of second-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different combinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying time spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly correlated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the low-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are nearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies, where the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime, shorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate waveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast, configurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the Michelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation effects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and analysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become effectively equivalent. Considering the usability in both frequency and time domain, the short-span PD4L scheme, which exhibits minimal nulls and superior performance in high frequencies, emerges as a promising candidate for future space-based GW mission designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) is the closest and one of the brightest high-frequency peaked blazars, located at a redshift of z = 0.031. It is a strong source of gamma rays, and its broadband emission has been extensively studied over the years through multi-wavelength observations from various telescopes. Mrk 421 has been a target of observational campaigns conducted by the SST-1M telescopes - two single-mirror small-size Cherenkov telescopes at Ondrejov Observatory, Prague, Czech Republic. These telescopes operate in mono and stereoscopic modes, utilizing the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT) to detect Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays in the 1-300 TeV energy range. We present recent SST-1M observations, data analysis, and the results of preliminary physical modeling of Mrk 421's emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Searching for Gravitational Waves with Gaia and its Cross-Correlation with PTA: Absolute vs Relative Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric missions like Gaia provide exceptionally precise measurements of stellar positions and proper motions. Gravitational waves traveling between the observer and distant stars can induce small, correlated shifts in these apparent positions, a phenomenon known as astrometric deflection. The precision and scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a stochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the two-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although Gaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal plane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit the precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can be mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which effectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute the astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative astrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the literature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of relative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis shows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is limited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs with large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are practically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate that combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays leads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than approximately 10^-7 Hz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) generate hundreds of thousands to millions of alerts, demanding automatic, unified classification of transients and variable stars for efficient follow-up. We present AppleCiDEr (Applying Multimodal Learning to Classify Transient Detections Early), a novel framework that integrates four key data modalities (photometry, image cutouts, metadata, and spectra) to overcome limitations of single-modality classification approaches. Our architecture introduces (i) two transformer encoders for photometry, (ii) a multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) with domain-specialized metadata towers and Mixture-of-Experts fusion for combining metadata and images, and (iii) a CNN for spectra classification. Training on ~ 30,000 real ZTF alerts, AppleCiDEr achieves high accuracy, allowing early identification and suggesting follow-up for rare transient spectra. The system provides the first unified framework for both transient and variable star classification using real observational data, with seamless integration into brokering pipelines, demonstrating readiness for the LSST era.</description>

Abstract: The Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment successfully detected sub-PeV $\gamma$-rays from the Crab nebula using a Surface Array and underground muon detector. Considering this, we are building in Bolivia a new experiment to explore the Southern Hemisphere, looking for the origins of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The name of this project is Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy (ALPACA). A prototype array called ALPAQUITA, with $1/4$ the total area of the full ALPACA, started observations in September $2022$. In this paper we introduce the status of ALPAQUITA and the plans to extend the array. We also report the results of the observation of the moon shadow in cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational wave signals using a single event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$, or roughly -0.26 radians. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,2) and (3,3) modes to vary separately and introducing a new waveform parameter to represent the phase offset between the two. We use simulated, asymmetric mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the $-\pi/12$ phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR $\gtrsim$ 40 and $\mathcal{M} \leq 30$. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization, measuring the offset to be $0.13^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$ for GW190412 and $-0.05^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ for GW190814. We also measure the Bayes factor in support of zero phase offset, $\log_{10} \mathcal{B}_{\Delta \varphi = 0}$, to be $-0.14$ for GW190412 and $0.21$ for GW190814. This implies our results are not strong enough to confidently argue if either event is a type II image, and is consistent with our statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei</title>

Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts, but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGNs (SDSS DR16). We report preliminary evidence of an excess of lower-luminosity ($10^{44.5} \lesssim L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as lower-Eddington ratio ($0.01 \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results support the theoretical speculation that some LVK events come from lower-luminosity or lower-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.</description>

      <title>Extending the micro-Hertz detection horizons via orbital resonance effect for geocentric gravitational wave antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mu$Hz gravitational wave band holds crucial insights into coalescing supermassive black hole binaries and stochastic backgrounds but remains inaccessible due to technical challenges. We demonstrate that geocentric space-based GW detectors (e.g., TianQin, gLISA, GADFLI) can bridge this gap by considering orbital resonance effects, circumventing the need for prohibitively long baselines. When GW frequencies match with integer multiples of a satellite's orbital frequency, sustained tidal forces induce cumulative orbital deviations through resonant effects, which, combined with orbital modulation, improve detector sensitivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the $\mu$Hz band. Consequently, geocentric missions can detect SMBHBs across significantly expanded mass-redshift parameter space and track their inspiral-merger-ringdown evolution. Crucially, such observations could synergize with pulsar timing array data of the same binaries at earlier inspiral stages, enabling unprecedented joint tests of strong-field gravity and binary evolution. Our findings establish geocentric antennas as a cost-effective, near-term precursor for unlocking the $\mu$Hz GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object. This object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.1$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.36$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 58$ km s$^{-1}$. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Very Large Telescope that resolve a compact coma. Using images obtained from several smaller ground-based telescopes, we find minimal light curve variation for the object over a $\sim4$ day time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is 17.1$\pm$0.2 %/100 nm, comparable to other interstellar objects and primitive solar system small bodies (comets and D-type asteroids). 3I/ATLAS will be observable through early September 2025, then unobservable by Earth-based observatories near perihelion due to low solar elongation. It will be observable again from the ground in late November 2025. Although this limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed Earth-based observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak, spacecraft at Mars could be used to make valuable observations at this time.</description>

      <title>Search for Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory: New Triggers, Methods, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector (SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE) range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle range of $60^{\circ} &lt; \theta &lt; 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$ search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be presented for the angular range explored.</description>
