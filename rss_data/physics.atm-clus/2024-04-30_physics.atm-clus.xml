      <title>Tensor hypercontraction for fully self-consistent imaginary-time GF2 and GWSOX methods: theory, implementation, and role of the Green's function second-order exchange for intermolecular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply tensor hypercontraction (THC) to reduce the computational scaling of expensive fully self-consistent Green's function methods. We present an efficient MPI-parallel algorithm and its implementation for evaluating the correlated second-order exchange term (SOX). This approach enabled us to conduct the largest fully self-consistent calculations with over 1100 atomic orbitals (AOs), with negligible errors attributed to THC fitting. Utilizing our THC implementation for scGW, scGF2, and scGWSOX (GW plus the SOX term iterated to achieve full Green's function self-consistency), we evaluated energies of intermolecular interactions. This approach allowed us to circumvent issues related to reference dependence and ambiguity in energy evaluation, which are common challenges in non-self-consistent calculations. We demonstrate that scGW exhibits a slight overbinding tendency for large systems, contrary to the underbinding observed with non-self-consistent RPA. Conversely, scGWSOX exhibits a slight underbinding tendency for such systems. This behavior is both physical and systematic and is caused by exclusion-principle violating diagrams or corresponding corrections. Our analysis elucidates the role played by these different diagrams, which is crucial for the construction of rigorous, accurate, and systematic methods. Finally, we explicitly show that all perturbative fully self-consistent Green's function methods are size-extensive.</description>

      <title>Trapping polar molecules by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to trap polar molecules with the electrical force induced by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) on piezoelectric materials. In this approach, the electrical force is perpendicular to the moving direction of the polar molecules, and is used to control the positions of trapped polar molecules in the direction orthogonal to the acoustic transmission. By virtue of an external electrical force, the SAW-induced electrical field can trap the polar molecules into single-layer or multi-layer lattices. The arrangement of molecules can affect the binding energy and localization of the molecule array. Then the one- or two-dimensional trapped polar molecule arrays can be used to construct the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, whose energy and dynamics are affected by the localizations of the trapped molecules. We find that the phase transitions between the superfluid and Mott insulator based on trapped polar molecule BH model can be modulated by the SAW induced electrical potential.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Two-component density functional theory study of quantized muons in solids"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [Phys. Rev. B 107, 094433 (2023)], Deng et al. have proposed an electron-muon correlation functional within the context of the two-component density functional theory (TC-DFT) for crystals/molecules containing positively charged muons. In order to verify its performance, we applied the functional in conjunction with the B3LYP, as a hybrid electronic exchange-correlation functional, to a benchmark set of molecules. The results demonstrate that the proposed functional is not capable of reproducing the correct one-muon densities as well as some other key properties like muon's kinetic energy, the total energies and the mean muonic bond lengths. Using the muonium atom in a double-harmonic trap as a model we also demonstrate that the successful reproduction of the electron-muon contact hyperfine coupling constants by Deng et al. is probably the result of error cancellations. We also discuss some theoretical intricacies with the very definition of the electron-muon correlation energy within the context of the TC-DFT that must be taken into account in future efforts to design electron-muon correlation functionals.</description>
