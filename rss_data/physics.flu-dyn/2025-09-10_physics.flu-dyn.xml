      <title>Onset of vortex shedding in flow past Rankine ovals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rankine oval is a classical geometry in potential flow, formed by superimposing a uniform stream with velocity U and a source-sink pair separated by distance 2a with strength m, resulting in a closed stagnation streamline whose shape is governed by the dimensionless parameter Ua/m. Although the Rankine body serves as a cornerstone for the classical theory of potential flow, its behavior in viscous flow remains unexplored. The Rankine oval is streamlined in inviscid flow but behaves as a bluff body in viscous flow. The onset of vortex shedding is a critical phenomenon in flows past a bluff body, mapping the transition from steady to periodic wakes. This study systematically investigates the onset of vortex shedding in Rankine oval flows and its associated fluid dynamics by performing direct numerical simulations of incompressible flow past Rankine ovals over Reynolds numbers from 10 to 200 and Ua/m from 0 to 1. The investigation reveals a linear relationship between Ua/m and the critical Reynolds number. This study further characterizes the lift and drag coefficients and Strouhal number, analyzes the vortex formation, and performs a data-driven dimensional analysis. This analysis identifies the dimensionless quantities and empirical formula that determine St and the friction drag coefficient as a function of Re, independent of Ua/m. For sufficiently large Ua/m, the pressure drag can be estimated using potential flow solutions, enabling reliable predictions of the total drag without numerical simulations. These conclusions collectively provide insights into the fluid dynamics of Rankine ovals across diverse flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Using Optimal Transport Aligned Latent Embeddings for Separated Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying differences between flow fields is a key challenge in fluid mechanics, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of flow control. Traditional vector metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, provide straightforward pointwise comparisons but can fail to distinguish distributional changes in flow fields. To address this limitation, we employ optimal transport (OT) theory, which is a mathematical framework built on probability and measure theory. By aligning Euclidean distances between flow fields in a latent space learned by an autoencoder with the corresponding OT geodesics, we seek to learn low-dimensional representations of flow fields that are interpretable from the perspective of unbalanced OT. As a demonstration, we utilize this OT-based analysis on controlled, separated flows past a NACA 0012 airfoil with a chord-based Reynolds number of 23,000 and a freestream Mach number of 0.3 for two angles of attack of $6^\circ$ and $9^\circ$. For each angle of attack, we identify a two-dimensional embedding that succinctly captures the different effective regimes of flow responses and control performance, characterized by the degree of suppression of the separation bubble and secondary effects from laminarization and trailing-edge separation. The interpretation of the latent representation was found to be consistent across the two angles of attack, suggesting that the OT-based latent encoding was capable of extracting physical relationships that are common across the different suites of cases. This study demonstrates the potential utility of optimal transport in the analysis and interpretation of complex flow fields.</description>

      <title>Effect of a horizontal magnetic field on the melting of low Prandtl number liquid metal in a phase-change Rayleigh-B\'enard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the low Prandtl number Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) system with a melting top boundary under horizontal magnetic fields. This study is crucial to gain physical insights into the melting dynamics of thermal storage systems, which will help in controlling them. A three-dimensional solid-liquid phase change Rayleigh-B\'enard system of gallium was numerically simulated using the enthalpy-porosity method in a cubic domain. In the absence of a magnetic field, the melting process was clearly divided into four regimes: conduction, stable growth, coarsening, and chaotic regimes. We analyzed the flow and heat transfer characteristics in each regime and established scaling relations for the Nusselt number and liquid fraction. Under horizontal magnetic fields, a quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) flow pattern was observed. We further examined the effects of magnetic field strength on different melting regimes. With increasing Hartmann number, a new flow mode emerged during the stable growth regime. The results also show that the magnetic field alters the relative duration of each melting regime in the overall melting process.</description>

      <title>A high-fidelity and efficient framework for point-particle direct numerical simulation based on multi-block overset grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a high-fidelity and efficient point-particle direct numerical simulation framework based on a multi-block overset curvilinear grid system, enabling large-scale Lagrangian particle tracking in complex geometries with high-order accuracy and low computational cost. To handle the multi-domain topological challenges inherent in such configurations, we develop an efficient particle storage and redistribution framework leveraging overset grid techniques. In particular, two optimization strategies have been proposed for particle redistribution: one is an innovative inter-block mapping within overlapping zones, and the other is a fast search-locate algorithm based on particle velocity. Together, these approaches significantly reduce the particle tracking overhead, especially for particles passing through interfaces between overlapping grid blocks. Moreover, the accuracy and robustness of the present framework are rigorously validated through various cases, including massless particle trajectories, one- and two-way coupled simulations. Specifically, we demonstrate the framework's applicability to the direct numerical simulation of particle-laden flow in a linear compressor cascade at engine-relevant conditions, showcasing its capability to resolve complex particle dynamics in turbomachinery configurations with low computational costs.</description>

      <title>Free oscillations of a standing surface wave and its mechanical analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analogy between natural oscillations of the standing wave type on a pool of liquid with an interface and a mechanical oscillator model. It is shown that the equations of motion governing both systems have qualitatively similar solutions - trivial as well as time-periodic with finite amplitude. The time-periodic solutions can be linearly unstable in both cases depending on the oscillation amplitude, thereby leading to interesting dynamics. Linear stability results of both systems are discussed in detail; a novel Mathieu-like equation is derived for the stability of the standing wave to a super-harmonic perturbation and reinforces the analogy. Analytical predictions are compared against numerical solution to the full nonlinear governing equations for both systems. A good match is obtained in most cases with theory; mismatches are further analysed and the limitations of this analogy is also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Backward similarity solution of the Boussinesq groundwater equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer resting on a horizontal impermeable layer with a boundary condition of a rapid increase in the source water level is considered in this work. The newly introduced condition, referred to as the backward power-law head condition, represents a situation where the water level in the adjacent water body increases more rapidly than do conventional problems, which can only represent a situation akin to a traveling wave under rising water level conditions, given its consideration of infinite time. This problem admits the similarity transformation which allows the nonlinear partial differential equation to be converted into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation via the Boltzmann transformation. The reduced boundary value problem is interpreted as the initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which can be numerically solved via Shampine's method. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with Kalashinikov's special solution, which is also introduced into the Boussinesq equation. We find that the solution is consistent with the limit of the forward power-law head condition. The new approximate analytical solution and the associated wetting front position are derived by assuming that the solution has the form of quadratic polynomials, which enables the description of the time progression of a real front position. The obtained approximation is compared to Shampine's solution to check the accuracy. Furthermore, the finite element method is applied to the original partial differential equation (PDE), which validates Shampine's solution for use as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Decoupling pressure gradient history effects in turbulent boundary layers through high-Reynolds number experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a carefully controlled examination of the universality of the von Karman and additive constants associated with the classical logarithmic scaling of the mean streamwise velocity profile in high-friction Reynolds number (Re_tau) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) subjected to weak-to-moderate adverse pressure gradients (APGs). The analysis leverages a recently developed method for imposing APGs with minimal pressure gradient (PG) history effects in Melbourne's high-Re_tau TBL facility (Deshpande et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, vol. 8, 2023), in combination with direct measurements of local friction velocity via oil-film interferometry. The von Karman constant is found to remain invariant within experimental uncertainty, while the additive coefficient decreases with both the local APG and PG history, potentially explaining reported variability in logarithmic scalings across the APG TBL literature. The facility enables manual prescription of APGs along the full test section, allowing weak PG history perturbations to be followed by extended recovery regions, while maintaining matched local PG and Re_tau at downstream measurement locations. This experimental configuration allows for systematic decoupling of the effects of Re_tau, local PGs, and PG history, enabling assessment of their individual contributions to single-point turbulence statistics and energy spectra across different TBL regions. Present results at high Re_tau show that PG history influences both small-scale and large-scale motions in the overlap and outer regions, whereas local PGs primarily affect the large-scales. The strongest effects of the local PG occur in the outer region (around 0.4delta, where delta is the boundary layer thickness), while PG history effects extend down to approximately 0.25delta, just above the logarithmic region.</description>

      <title>Gravity drives the flow within the Stewartson layer in centrifugal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional numerical simulations on centrifugal convection (CC) in a closed annular container, incorporating gravity and no-slip top and bottom boundaries, to systematically investigate rotation-induced secondary flow. The Stewartson layer, identified by an elongated circulation in mean vertical velocity plots, emerges near the inner and outer cylinders only beyond a critical gravitational forcing. Quantitative analyses confirm that the layer thickness scales as $\delta_{st}\sim Ek^{1/3}$ due to rotational effects, consistent with results from rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where $Ek$ represents the Ekman number. The internal circulation strength, however, is determined by both gravitational buoyancy and rotational effects. We propose that gravitational buoyancy drives the internal flow, which balances against viscous forces to establish a terminal velocity. Through theoretical analysis, the vertical velocity amplitude follows $W_{st}\sim Ek^{5/3}Ro^{-1}Ra_gPr^{-1}$, showing good agreement with simulation results across a wide parameter range. Here, $Ro^{-1}$ represents the inverse Rossby number, $Ra_g$ the gravitational Rayleigh number, and $Pr$ the Prandtl number. The theoretical predictions match simulations well, demonstrating that the Stewartson layer is gravity-induced and rotationally constrained through geostrophic balance in the CC system. These findings yield fundamental insights into turbulent flow structures and heat transfer mechanisms in the CC system, offering both theoretical advances and practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the water exit of the accelerating circular cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the vortical dynamics generated during the forced exit of a circular cylinder through a quiescent free surface. While previous work on exit flows has largely emphasized cavity collapse and force generation, the formation and evolution of the starting vortex beneath the body have received much less attention. Using high-speed particle image velocimetry at up to 2000 Hz, we isolate and track the primary vortex shed during exit. The body motion is driven by constant vertical acceleration from rest, such that the cylinder kinematics satisfy $v_{cyl}^2$ = $2$$\alpha$$\Delta$$y_{cyl}$, with $\Delta$ $y_{cyl}$ the displacement since release. This controlled protocol allows systematic variation of the acceleration alpha while keeping the maximum crossing velocity fixed. We characterize vortex trajectories, equivalent radius, peak vorticity, and circulation, and compare across accelerations. The results show that circulation growth collapses under the impulse-based scaling $\Gamma / \sqrt(\alpha(\Delta y_{cyl})^3)$, independent of the imposed acceleration. A consistent transition is observed as the vortex centroid approaches the free surface, where its evolution is modified by surface interaction. The trajectories remain predominantly vertical with only weak lateral drift, robust across all accelerations. Taken together, these findings establish a systematic framework for water-exit vortex dynamics under constant acceleration and highlight scaling features that parallel the classical starting-vortex problem in entry flows.</description>

      <title>Lighthill's mechanism and vorticity cascade in the logarithmic layer of wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Lighthill's proposed turbulent mechanism for near-wall concentration of spanwise vorticity by calculating mean flows conditioned on motion away from or toward the wall in an $Re_\tau=1000$ database of plane-parallel channel flow. Our results corroborate Lighthill's proposal throughout the entire logarithmic layer, but extended by counterflows that help explain anti-correlation of vorticity transport by advection and by stretching/tilting. We present evidence also for Lighthill's hypothesis that the vorticity transport in the log-layer is a ``cascade process'' through a scale-hierarchy of eddies, with intense competition between transport outward from and inward to the wall. Townsend's model of attached eddies of hairpin-vortex type accounts for half of the vorticity cascade, whereas we identify necklace-type or ``shawl vortices'' that envelop turbulent sweeps as supplying the other half.</description>

      <title>Distributed force element decomposition with method of fundamental solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the contribution of vortex structures to pressure stress is useful for designing flow control strategies to mitigate low or drag. The traditional force-element method focuses on the contribution of vortex structures to the resultant force. However, the contribution of vortex structures to the distributed force can not be identified. To address this problem, a distributed force element method is proposed. This method projects the Navier-Stokes equation to a divergence-free space and obtain a Poisson equation for pressure. The Green's function is employed to express pressure stress on the solid boundary as a combination of volume and surface integrals. Contributions to the distributed source are divided into acceleration surface elements, vorticity surface elements, convection volume elements. The method of fundamental solutions and singular value decomposition are used to efficiently solve the Green's functions. The distributed force element method is validated using laminar flows around a stationary circular cylinder and oscillating circular cylinder, and three-dimensional laminar and turbulent flows around a sphere. In laminar flow over a circular cylinder, fluctuation of forces mainly originate from volume sources, while in flow over an oscillating circular cylinder, inertial and volume source terms may cancel out, suppressing lift fluctuation. In flows over a sphere, a strong negative volume source in the boundary layer on the sphere creates low-pressure regions, while pressure in the separated shear layer is close to zero.</description>

      <title>Wind farm layout optimization using a novel machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to optimize wind farm layouts for maximum annual energy production (AEP). The optimization effort requires efficient wake models to predict the wake flow and, subsequently, the power generation of wind farms with reasonable accuracy and low computational cost. Wake flow predictions using large-eddy simulation (LES) ensure high fidelity, while reduced-order models, e.g., the Gaussian-curl hybrid (GCH), provide computational efficiency. We integrate LES results and the GCH model to develop a machine learning (ML) framework based on an autoencoder-based convolutional neural network, allowing for a reliable and cost-effective prediction of the wake flow field. We trained the ML model using high-fidelity LES results as the target vector, while low-fidelity data from the GCH model serve as the input vector. The efficiency of the ML model to predict the AEP of the South Fork wind farm, offshore Rhode Island, was illustrated. Then, we integrated the ML model into a greedy optimization algorithm to determine the optimal wind farm layout in terms of turbine positioning. The optimized wind farm layout is shown to achieve a 2. 05\% improvement in AEP over the existing wind farm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Surfaces for Turbulent Circulation Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forward a novel formulation of the vortex gas model of turbulent circulation statistics to address the challenging case of nonplanar circulation contours. Relying upon a field-theoretical description, statistical moments of the circulation turn out to be functionally dependent on specific {\it{optimal surfaces}} bounded by the circulation loops. Circulation is modeled in the optimal curved spaces with the help of scalar vertex operators that represent the multifractal density fluctuations of Gaussian-correlated vortex structures. We show that minimal surfaces are optimal within the inertial range, but subdominant deviations are expected to become significant for contours with linear dimensions close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. As a case study, we demonstrate the model's applicability through a Monte Carlo evaluation of the circulation probability distribution function for a nonplanar contour, which is in excellent agreement with results of extensive direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation by radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15340v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an investigation of second harmonic generation (SHG) resulting from interaction of radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous, unmagnetized plasma. Lorentz force and continuity equations have been used to derive the radial and axial current density components. Further, using these densities in the wave equation leads to analytical expressions for the SHG field amplitudes. These amplitudes exhibit periodic oscillations along the propagation axis, characterized by detuning length dependent on plasma density and laser parameters. Radial and axial contributions to SHG are found to be highly enhanced near the beam axis due to the Gaussian beam profile of the laser. The analytical findings are validated using Fourier Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulations. Notably, unlike linearly or circularly polarized beams which require either inhomogeneous or magnetized plasma, radially polarized beams facilitate efficient harmonic generation in homogeneous unmagnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>How hydrodynamic interactions alter polymer stretching in turbulence</title>

Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between segments of a polymer have long been known to strongly affect polymer stretching in laminar viscometric flows. Yet the role of HI in fluctuating turbulent flows remains unclear. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we examine the stretching dynamics of bead-spring chains with inter-bead HI, as they are transported in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow (within the ultra-dilute, one-way coupling regime). We find that HI-endowed chains exhibit a steeper coil-stretch transition as the elastic relaxation time is increased, i.e., HI cause less stretching of stiff polymers and more stretching of moderately to highly elastic polymers. The probability distribution function of the end-to-end extension is also modified, with HI significantly limiting the range of extensions over which a power-law range appears. On quantifying the repeated stretching and recoiling of chains by computing persistence time distributions, we find that HI delays migration between stretched and coiled states. These effects of HI, which are consistent with chains experiencing an effective conformation-dependent drag, are sensitive to the level of coarse-graining in the bead-spring model. Specifically, an HI-endowed dumbbell, which cannot form a physical coil, is unable to experience the hydrodynamic shielding effect of HI. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating an extension-dependent drag force in dumbbell-based simulations of turbulent polymer solutions. To develop and test such an augmented dumbbell model, we propose the use of a time-correlated Gaussian random flow, in which the turbulent stretching statistics are shown to be well-approximated.</description>

      <title>Investigation of particle dynamics and classification mechanism in a spiral jet mill through computational fluid dynamics and discrete element methods</title>

Abstract: Predicting the outcome of jet-milling based on the knowledge of process parameters and starting material properties is a task still far from being accomplished. Given the technical difficulties in measuring thermodynamics, flow properties and particle statistics directly in the mills, modelling and simulations constitute alternative tools to gain insight in the process physics and many papers have been recently published on the subject. An ideal predictive simulation tool should combine the correct description of non-isothermal, compressible, high Mach number fluid flow, the correct particle-fluid and particle-particle interactions and the correct fracture mechanics of particle upon collisions but it is not currently available. In this paper we present our coupled CFD-DEM simulation results; while comparing them with the recent modelling and experimental works we will review the current understating of the jet-mill physics and particle classification. Subsequently we analyze the missing elements and the bottlenecks currently limiting the simulation technique as well as the possible ways to circumvent them towards a quantitative, predictive simulation of jet-milling.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds -- General theory and analytical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for Navier-Stokes flow on self-evolving surfaces is presented. It is based on a general curvilinear surface parameterization that describes the motion of the ALE frame. Its in-plane part becomes fully arbitrary, while its out-of-plane part follows the material motion of the surface. This allows for the description of flows on deforming surfaces using only surface meshes. The unknown fields are the fluid density or pressure, the fluid velocity and the surface motion, where the latter two share the same normal velocity. The corresponding field equations are the continuity equation or area-incompressibility constraint, the surface Navier-Stokes equations, and suitable surface mesh equations. Particularly advantageous are mesh equations based on membrane elasticity. The presentation focuses on the coupled set of strong and weak form equations, and presents several manufactured steady and transient solutions. These solutions are used together with numerical simulations to illustrate and discuss the properties of the proposed new ALE formulation. They also serve as basis for the development and verification of corresponding computational methods. The new formulation allows for a detailed study of fluidic membranes such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid bilayers.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of turbulent mixing: discrete shell structures in scalar concentration</title>

Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for the one-point distribution of a passive scalar in decaying homogeneous turbulence, in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity at fixed Schmidt number. The velocity statistics are governed by the Euler ensemble, obtained previously as a spontaneously stochastic solution to the loop equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in the extreme turbulent limit. The resulting advection-diffusion problem is solved explicitly via loop calculus. For an initially localized scalar distribution, the solution develops a sequence of concentric spherical shells with a quantized, piecewise-parabolic radial profile of temperature and a finite limit at the center -- an outcome not predicted by conventional theories. This shell structure is the unique solution of the transport equation within the Euler ensemble, but may be smeared by finite diffusivity or forcing. It represents the geometric skeleton of scalar transport in ideal turbulence, and may be relevant in astrophysical or quantum-fluid regimes where dissipation is negligible. This work redefines expectations for scalar mixing in the high-Reynolds-number limit.</description>

      <title>Solute mixing in porous media with dispersion and buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the process of convective mixing in two-dimensional, homogeneous and isotropic porous media with dispersion. We considered a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in which the presence of a solute produces density differences driving the flow. The effect of dispersion is modelled using an anisotropic Fickian dispersion tensor (Bear, J. Geophys. Res. 1961). In addition to molecular diffusion ($D_m^*$), the solute is redistributed by an additional spreading, in longitudinal and transverse flow directions, which is quantified by the coefficients $D_l^*$ and $D_t^*$, respectively, and it is produced by the presence of the pores. The flow is controlled by three dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh-Darcy number $Ra$, defining the relative strength of convection and diffusion, and the dispersion parameters $r=D_l^*/D_t^*$ and $\Delta=D_m^*/D_t^*$. With the aid of numerical Darcy simulations, we investigate the mixing dynamics without and with dispersion. We find that in absence of dispersion ($\Delta\to\infty$) the dynamics is self-similar and independent of $Ra$, and the flow evolves following several regimes, which we analyse. Then we analyse the effect of dispersion on the flow evolution for a fixed value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number ($Ra=10^4$). A detailed analysis of the molecular and dispersive components of the mean scalar dissipation reveals a complex interplay between flow structures and solute mixing. The proposed theoretical framework, in combination with pore-scale simulations and bead packs experiments, can be used to validate and improve current dispersion models to obtain more reliable estimates of solute transport and spreading in buoyancy-driven subsurface flows.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Equivariant U-Shaped Neural Operators for the Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries. Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics, achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.</description>
