      <title>Probing optical and acoustic phonons in heated nano-Si/epoxy composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the thermal response of optical and acoustic phonons is crucial for designing functional polymer nanocomposites. We study silicon nanoparticle (Si NP)-epoxy composites using combined Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy under local(laser-induced) and global(stage-controlled) heating. Raman spectra reveal THz longitudinal optical(LO) phonon softening and spectral broadening under local heating, indicating nanoscale hot-spots and interfacial scattering. Brillouin data track GHz longitudinal acoustic(LA) phonons, showing temperature- and concentration-dependent evolution of elasticity and damping. Contrasting heating methods unravels Si loading thresholds for isolated thermal absorbers, thermal percolation, acoustic attenuation and elastic homogenization. Local heating induces greater phonon softening and damping than global heating, with this disparity amplified at higher loadings by thermal gradients and interfacial dissipation. Global heating correlates with viscoelastic relaxation, showing intensified acoustic attenuation near the glass transition. Raman thermometry coupled with finite-element opto-thermal modeling allows evaluation of thermal conductivity of the composites characterized by increase from 0.09 to 0.46 W/(mK) for 0.07 up to 2 wt% of Si NPs, respectively, outperforming SiC nanowires at 2 wt% [D. Shen et al, Sci. Rep. 7, 2606 (2017)] despite bulk conductivity of Si being more than 3 times smaller than that of SiC. However, effective heat conductivity of our nanocomposites remain far below bulk Si, confirming that interfacial thermal resistance, not filler conductivity, governs heat transport.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Mathieu-Type Dynamics in a Tabletop Magnetic Trap: A Coil-Driven Parametric Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tabletop demonstration of dynamic stabilization and ponderomotive-like trapping using a pair of sinusoidally-driven anti-Helmholtz coils and a suspended permanent magnet. The oscillating field produces a rapid micromotion superimposed on a slower secular oscillation, with micromotion amplitude increasing with displacement and peaking near the turning points. This behavior reveals a ponderomotive-like mechanism: a spatial gradient of micromotion amplitude that drives slow secular motion. The time-averaged effect provides a time-averaged harmonic (ponderomotive) restoring force that confines the magnet between the coils. Driving at 12-18 Hz places the system in a small-q regime where the two time scales are clearly separated and directly visible to the eye. Video tracking (included with this article) quantifies the motion and reveals a stability edge as the drive frequency is lowered (near 6-7 Hz in our apparatus). From trajectories in the 12-18 Hz range, we extract an effective Mathieu parameter q ~ 0.16 from the measured timescale separation of the secular versus drive frequencies. The apparatus uses inexpensive, readily available parts, and we provide a concise materials list, analysis code, field-gradient calibration data, and demonstration videos.</description>

      <title>Upstream Laser-based Longitudinal Enhancement of Relativistic Photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal phase space of high-brightness relativistic electron beams is crucial for advancing a broad spectrum of charged-particle-based instrumentation and scientific frontiers. A generalized method for achieving this control involves manipulating the photoemission laser's temporal distribution at the picosecond level, a long-standing technical challenge. Recent developments in laser shaping have enabled the creation of high-power, picosecond-scale symmetrical and asymmetrical temporal profiles, capable of fine-tuning complex space-charge dynamics and external field effects in relativistic charged-particle beams. Here, we demonstrate that rather than deviations from theorized, idealized laser distributions, a controlled asymmetry can be harnessed to counteract accelerator-induced distortions. By implementing spatiotemporal shaping of the ultraviolet photocathode laser at the LCLS-II superconducting injector, we achieve deterministic control over the longitudinal phase space without downstream corrections. We find that this optical asymmetry induces a self-linearizing effect across both low (40 pC) and high (80 pC) charge regimes, effectively suppressing nonlinear compression and energy chirp. Consequently, this approach is expected to preserve a low emittance comparable to that of ideal flattop or regular Gaussian profiles, while delivering superior current uniformity and shot-to-shot stability. These results establish spatiotemporal laser shaping as a compact, generalizable tool for directly optimizing beam brightness at the source.</description>

      <title>Electric-current control of anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate robust and reversible electric-current control of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a two-dimensional WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) stack. Applying a current through Td-WTe2 leads to a giant modulation of the AHE of the adjacent FGT layer, with the relative change of the AHE conductivity exceeding 180%. Control experiments show that i) the observed effect is absent in pure FGT, ii) the modulation weakens in thicker FGT films, confirming its interfacial origin, and iii) the modulation peaks for bilayer WTe2, indicating that the Berry-curvature dipole (BCD) plays the dominant role in the modulation. We propose that the charge current I generates an out-of-plane magnetization Mz via BCD in WTe2 and Mz modifies the exchange splitting of FGT via the inverse magnetic proximity effect, thereby altering its Berry curvature and nontrivially influencing the AHE. The demonstrated method of AHE control offers new possibilities for magnetism control, i.e., for the study of AHE-transistors as well as electric-current control of quantum magnets, especially magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Integration and Resource Estimation of Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Pascal's triangle in cascaded polarization optics: an intuitive framework for field transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature is imbued with mathematics, manifested through its stunning patterns, symmetries, and structures. Here, we unveil that in a multilayered framework of twisted birefringent optical components, a recursive number pattern of Pascal's triangle is naturally embedded in the structure of the Jones matrix which intuitively provide a generalized solution for pixel-to-pixel field transformation. The resulting standalone solution is universal across the electromagnetic spectrum, unifies N-layered metasurface and conventional bulk waveplates in a single framework, offers comprehensive insights about the bidirectional complex amplitude modulation and wavefront engineering in linear and circular polarization bases, and at the same time substantially reduces the computational cost. In essence, the discovery of number patterns in polarization optics/photonics will have broad impact across quantum optics, theory informed artificial intelligence model trainings, biomedical engineering and imaging, polarization information encryption, and advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Visible octave frequency combs in silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides driven by Ti:sapphire lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear nanophotonic waveguides have opened a route to compact frequency combs for precision metrology, spectroscopy and astronomy, yet broadband comb access to the visible remains challenging on CMOS-compatible platforms. Silicon nitride is widely accessible and low loss into the visible, but most demonstrations rely on telecom pumping and thick stress-managed films, where the large spectral gap to the visible dispersive wave raises the soliton order and power required for efficient conversion. Here we show that pumping closer to the visible provides a complementary route. Starting from crack-free 400 nm SiN films, we implement dispersion-engineering with air-clad nanophotonic waveguides whose enhanced geometric dispersion opens an anomalous-dispersion window across the Ti-sapphire tuning range. Femtosecond Ti-sapphire pulses then drive octave-spanning combs from the visible to the near-infrared, with the visible edge and overall bandwidth lithographically tuned by the waveguide width at pulse energies of only tens of picojoules. The air-clad geometry also produces strong polarization-dependent dispersion, enabling switching between all-normal and soliton-dominated broadening in the same device, and support octave-spanning combs at 1 GHz repetition rates directly driven by a compact diode-pumped Ti-sapphire oscillator. These results position air-clad SiN nanophotonic waveguides as an efficient interface between emerging short-wavelength integrated gain platforms and fully integrated visible frequency-comb engines.</description>

      <title>Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</description>

      <title>Backscatter Communication Through Disordered Media Enabled by a Programmable Leaky Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving information through disordered scattering systems remains a major challenge in wireless communication and sensing due to the severe distortion and attenuation caused by multiple scattering. Here, we demonstrate robust focusing through random media using a leaky cavity made programmable by reconfigurable metasurfaces. We show that the leaky cavity leverages backscattering from the disordered medium to enhance the degree of control over the transmitted field. We achieve an enhancement in focused intensity by an order of magnitude compared to a horn antenna. We further demonstrate robust communication through the medium using low-power amplitude-modulated signals, and finally implement a backscatter communication scheme in which the same cavity illuminates and decodes data from a passive reflectivity-modulating target embedded within the disorder. Our results open new possibilities for reliable communication and sensing in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of THz Radiation Generation in Multi-Color Laser-Plasma Interactions: A Review Across Diverse Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of Terahertz (THz) waves has captivated researchers across diverse scientific disciplines such as physics, spectroscopy, chemistry, biology, and engineering, driven by the myriad applications these waves offer. Within this expansive landscape, the development of efficient and reliable THz sources stands as a paramount objective. In the pursuit of this goal, a multitude of approaches have been undertaken, with a notable contender emerging in the form of laser-induced plasma. Harnessing the advancements in ultrafast pulses, laser-induced plasma has proven to be a promising tool for generating THz waves. Its appeal lies in the robust attributes of a high power threshold, intense THz signal, and an broadband THz spectrum. This paper delves into a comprehensive review of the physics and progress underlying THz generation from laser-induced plasmas, exploring scenarios where plasmas are induced in gases, liquids, and solids. The interactions between lasers and plasmas involve complex physical processes, resulting in a variety of laser plasma scenarios for THz generation. In this review, the focus is specifically placed on classifying THz generation based on different physical mechanisms and also examines the characteristics of the emitted THz waves. By categorizing the processes, a deeper understanding of the underlying principles can be attained.</description>

Abstract: We explore a magnetooptomechanical system consisting of a single magnetic microparticle optically levitated within the core of a helically twisted single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. We use newly-developed magnetic particles that have a core of antiferromagnetic yttrium-ortho-ferrite (YFeO3) and a shell of ferrimagnetic YIG (Y3Fe5O12) approximately 50 nm thick. Using a 632.8 nm probe beam, we observe optical-torque-induced rotation of the particle and rotation of the magnetization vector in presence of an external static magnetic field. This one-of-a-kind platform opens a path to novel investigations of optomagnetic physics with levitated magnetic particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter addresses the physics-consistent optimization of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with mutual coupling (MC) and 1-bit-programmable RIS elements. This combination of constraints is typical of current prototypes but unexplored in theoretical work. First, we present a simple statistical generator for multiport-network-theory (MNT) parameters of rich-scattering, RIS-parametrized channels. We account for reciprocity, passivity, and coherent backscattering; then, we add a simple hyper-parameter to control the MC strength. Second, we benchmark model-agnostic (dictionary search, coordinate descent, genetic algorithm) and model-based (temperature-annealed back-propagation) strategies under varying MC, with and without intelligent initialization. Except when MC is negligible, coordinate descent with random initialization offers the best trade-off in performance, runtime, and memory. Our insights can guide wireless practitioners who optimize RIS prototypes and other reconfigurable wave systems.</description>

      <title>Thermally adaptive textile inspired by morpho butterfly for all-season comfort and visible aesthetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding challenge in personal thermal management has been transitioning from static, appearance-limited passive radiative cooling (PDRC) materials to systems that are both dynamically adaptive and visually versatile. The central hurdle remains the inherent compromise between color saturation and cooling power. Inspired by organisms such as butterflies, which decouple structural color from thermal function, we present a smart textile that seamlessly merges a dynamic thermochromic layer with static photonic crystals (PCs). This design enables the solar reflectance to be autonomously switched-from approximately 0.6 in the colored state for heating to about 0.9 in the high-reflectance state for cooling. Consequently, outdoor experiments validated substantial temperature regulation: the fabric achieves a surface temperature reduction of 3-4 {\deg}C in summer and a heating difference of &lt;1 {\deg}C in winter compared to commercial reference materials, all while maintaining high-saturation colors. This dual-mode operation offers a viable pathway for achieving adaptive, aesthetic, and energy-free thermal comfort.</description>
