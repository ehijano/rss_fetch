      <title>Modification of the uniform electron gas polarizational stopping power due to the interaction of the projectile with new collective modes at moderate and strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed study of the polarizational stopping power of a homogeneous electron gas in moderate and strong coupling regimes using the self-consistent version of the method of moments as the key theoretical approach capable of expressing the dynamic characteristics of the system in terms of the static ones, which are the moments. We develop a robust framework that relies on nine sum rules and other exact relationships to analyze electron-electron interactions and their impact on energy-loss processes. We derive an expression for the stopping power that takes into account both quantum statistical effects and electron correlation phenomena. Our results demonstrate significant deviations from classical stopping power predictions, especially under the strong coupling conditions when electron dynamics is highly dependent on collective behavior and a projectile interacts with the system collective modes revealed in Phys. Rev. B 107, 195143 (2023). This work not only advances the theoretical understanding of the homogeneous electron gas but also has implications for practical applications in fields such as plasma physics and materials science.</description>

      <title>Tightening energetic bounds on linear gyrokinetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounding energetic growth of gyrokinetic instabilities is a complementary approach to linear instability analyses involving normal eigenmodes. Previous work has focused on upper bounds which are valid linearly and nonlinearly. However, if an upper bound on linear instability growth is desired, these nonlinearly valid bounds may be a poor predictor of the growth of the most unstable eigenmode. This is most evident for the simplest of instabilities: the ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) mode in slab geometry. In this work, we derive energetic upper bounds specifically for linear instability growth, focusing on the slab ITG. We show that there is no fundamental limitation on how tightly linear growth can be bounded by an energetic norm, with the tightest possible bound being given by a special energy comprised of projection coefficients of the linear eigenmode basis. Additionally, we consider `constrained optimal modes' that maximise energy growth subject to constraints that are also obeyed by the linear eigenmodes. This yields computationally efficient upper bounds that closely resemble the linear growth rate, capturing effects connected to the real frequency of instabilities, which have been absent in the energetic bounds considered thus far.</description>

      <title>Image rotation in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the speed of light compared to material motion, the dragging of light is difficult to observe under laboratory conditions. Here we report on the first observation of image rotation, i. e. a dragging by the medium of the wave's transverse structure, of Alfv\'en waves in plasmas. Exploiting the naturally slow group velocity of these waves, significant wave rotation is achieved for modest angular frequency. Control over the rotation of the wave's structure is demonstrated through the plasma rotation imposed by biased electrodes. Remarkably, experimental results are well reproduced by light dragging theory derived for isotropic media, even if magnetized plasmas are anisotropic. In addition to offering new insights into the fundamental issue of angular momentum coupling between waves and media, these findings also open possibilities for new remote rotation sensing tools.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analytical Model of the Dynamic Z-Pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we discuss the development of an analytical 1D axisymmetric model describing the implosion story of the dynamic z-pinch. This model is capable of predicting the trajectories of the imploding sheath's magnetic piston and preceding shock front, along with the velocity, pressure, density, and axial magnetic field profiles, for any time-dependent current, spatially-varying initial density profile, and initial axial field. Its implementation consists of simultaneously solving a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations, derived from the ideal MHD equations, whose forms evolve throughout different stages of the implosion to best reflect the underlying physics. Comparison with experimental data from the COBRA pulsed-power installation is quite promising, and implies this model could prove useful in designing and analyzing future pulsed-power experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmic-Ray Transport: Magnetized versus Unmagnetized Motion in Astrophysical Magnetic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem, and despite decades of study the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focused attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behavior emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterize particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetized motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetized motion characterized by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetized motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetized motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasize the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.</description>
