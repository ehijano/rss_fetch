      <title>Orchestration for Domain-specific Edge-Cloud Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired many applications, which often necessitate edge-cloud collaboration due to connectivity, privacy, and cost considerations. Traditional methods primarily focus on selecting the best LLM model for optimizing performance, while neglecting the critical interplay between the components of the LLM serving pipeline (context retrieval, query preprocessing, etc.) or the changing latency and cost constraints. We introduce ECO-LLM (Edge-Cloud Orchestrator for LLMs), a novel system that reframes this problem as a joint optimization challenge and solves it by systematically exploring component configurations and dynamically selecting optimal strategies at the query level. ECO-LLM consists of two components: (1) the ECO-LLM Emulator, which efficiently explores the vast configuration space utilizing query clustering and pareto-optimal path selection, gathering domain-specific performance metrics without exhaustive evaluation; and (2) the ECO-LLM Runtime, which leverages these metrics to dynamically select optimal resolution strategies for user queries while meeting user-defined Service Level Objectives (SLOs). We evaluate ECO-LLM on a smart home and a smart car assistant scenarios. With an exhaustive exploration of all possible configurations for seen queries, ECO-LLM outperforms cloud-based models like GPT-4o in terms of accuracy (90% vs. 74% on average) while reducing costs by 90% and latency by 55%, demonstrating the value of its joint optimization at the query level. In practical deployment for previously unseen queries, ECO-LLM selects configurations that reduce costs by 62% or improve response times by 62% on average compared to state-of-the-art model routing approaches, while maintaining higher accuracy and consistently adhering to specified latency and cost constraints.</description>

      <title>HedraRAG: Coordinating LLM Generation and Database Retrieval in Heterogeneous RAG Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses emerging system-level challenges in heterogeneous retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) serving, where complex multi-stage workflows and diverse request patterns complicate efficient execution. We present HedraRAG, a runtime system built on a graph-based abstraction that exposes optimization opportunities across stage-level parallelism, intra-request similarity, and inter-request skewness. These opportunities are realized through dynamic graph transformations, such as node splitting, reordering, edge addition, and dependency rewiring, applied to wavefronts of subgraphs spanning concurrent requests. The resulting execution plans are mapped onto hybrid CPU-GPU pipelines to improve resource utilization and reduce latency. Evaluations across a wide range of RAG workflows demonstrate speedups exceeding 1.5x and reaching up to 5x over existing frameworks, showcasing the effectiveness of coordinated generation and retrieval in serving environments.</description>

      <title>TRACER: Efficient Object Re-Identification in Networked Cameras through Adaptive Query Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently re-identifying and tracking objects across a network of cameras is crucial for applications like traffic surveillance. Spatula is the state-of-the-art video database management system (VDBMS) for processing Re-ID queries. However, it suffers from two limitations. Its spatio-temporal filtering scheme has limited accuracy on large camera networks due to localized camera history. It is not suitable for critical video analytics applications that require high recall due to a lack of support for adaptive query processing.
  In this paper, we present Tracer, a novel VDBMS for efficiently processing Re-ID queries using an adaptive query processing framework. Tracer selects the optimal camera to process at each time step by training a recurrent network to model long-term historical correlations. To accelerate queries under a high recall constraint, Tracer incorporates a probabilistic adaptive search model that processes camera feeds in incremental search windows and dynamically updates the sampling probabilities using an exploration-exploitation strategy. To address the paucity of benchmarks for the Re-ID task due to privacy concerns, we present a novel synthetic benchmark for generating multi-camera Re-ID datasets based on real-world traffic distribution. Our evaluation shows that Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-camera analytics system by 3.9x on average across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>THOR: Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the THOR (Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval) Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail. An integrated Self-Correction &amp; Rating loop captures empty results, execution errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise, human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight &amp; Intelligence engine for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and enterprise-grade safety.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LSM-tree based Key-Value Stores: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LSM-tree is a widely adopted data structure in modern key-value store systems that optimizes write performance in write-heavy applications by using append writes to achieve sequential writes. However, the unpredictability of LSM-tree compaction introduces significant challenges, including performance variability during peak workloads and in resource-constrained environments, write amplification caused by data rewriting during compactions, read amplification from multi-level queries, trade-off between read and write performance, as well as efficient space utilization to mitigate space amplification. Prior studies on LSM-tree optimizations have addressed the above challenges; however, in recent years, research on LSM-tree optimization has continued to propose. The goal of this survey is to review LSM-tree optimization, focusing on representative works in the past five years. This survey first studies existing solutions on how to mitigate the performance impact of LSM-tree flush and compaction and how to improve basic key-value operations. In addition, distributed key-value stores serve multi-tenants, ranging from tens of thousands to millions of users with diverse requirements. We then analyze the new challenges and opportunities in these modern architectures and across various application scenarios. Unlike the existing survey papers, this survey provides a detailed discussion of the state-of-the-art work on LSM-tree optimizations and gives future research directions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Temporal Simple Path Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between two entities often occur at specific timestamps, which can be modeled as a temporal graph. Exploring the relationships between vertices based on temporal paths is one of the fundamental tasks. In this paper, we conduct the first research to propose and investigate the problem of generating the temporal simple path graph (tspG), which is the subgraph consisting of all temporal simple paths from the source vertex to the target vertex within the given time interval. Directly enumerating all temporal simple paths and constructing the tspG is computationally expensive. To accelerate the processing, we propose an efficient method named Verification in Upper-bound Graph. It first incorporates the temporal path constraint and simple path constraint to exclude unpromising edges from the original graph, which obtains a tight upper-bound graph as a high-quality approximation of the tspG in polynomial time. Then, an Escape Edges Verification algorithm is further applied in the upper-bound graph to construct the exact tspG without exhaustively enumerating all temporal simple paths between given vertices. Finally, comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world graphs are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Storage-Compute Bottleneck in Billion-Scale ANNS: A GPU-Driven Asynchronous I/O Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of information retrieval, recommendation systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) gains widespread applications due to its higher performance and accuracy. While several disk-based ANNS systems have emerged to handle exponentially growing vector datasets, they suffer from suboptimal performance due to two inherent limitations: 1) failing to overlap SSD accesses with distance computation processes and 2) extended I/O latency caused by suboptimal I/O Stack. To address these challenges, we present FlashANNS, a GPU-accelerated out-of-core graph-based ANNS system through I/O-compute overlapping. Our core insight lies in the synchronized orchestration of I/O and computation through three key innovations: 1) Dependency-Relaxed asynchronous pipeline: FlashANNS decouples I/O-computation dependencies to fully overlap between GPU distance calculations and SSD data transfers. 2) Warp-Level concurrent SSD access: FlashANNS implements a lock-free I/O stack with warp-level concurrency control, to reduce the latency-induced time overhead. 3) Computation-I/O balanced graph degree Selection: FlashANNS selects graph degrees via lightweight compute-to-I/O ratio sampling, ensuring optimal balance between computational load and storage access latency across different I/O bandwidth configurations. We implement FlashANNS and compare it with state-of-the-art out-of-core ANNS systems (SPANN, DiskANN) and a GPU-accelerated out-of-core ANNS system (FusionANNS). Experimental results demonstrate that at $\geq$95\% recall@10 accuracy, our method achieves 2.3-5.9$\times$ higher throughput compared to existing SOTA methods with a single SSD, and further attains 2.7-12.2$\times$ throughput improvement in multi-SSD configurations.</description>

      <title>LogLite: Lightweight Plug-and-Play Streaming Log Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log data is a vital resource for capturing system events and states. With the increasing complexity and widespread adoption ofmodern software systems and IoT devices, the daily volume of log generation has surged to tens of petabytes, leading to significant collection and storage costs. To address this challenge, lossless log compression has emerged as an effective solution, enabling substantial resource savings without compromising log information. In this paper, we first conduct a characterization study on extensive public log datasets and identify four key observations. Building on these insights, we propose LogLite, a lightweight, plug-and-play, streaming lossless compression algorithm designed to handle both TEXT and JSON logs throughout their life cycle. LogLite requires no predefined rules or pre-training and is inherently adaptable to evolving log structures. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, LogLite achieves Pareto optimality in most scenarios, delivering an average improvement of up to 67.8% in compression ratio and up to 2.7 $\times$ in compression speed.</description>

      <title>Instance-Optimized String Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research found that cloud data warehouses are text-heavy. However, their capabilities for efficiently processing string columns remain limited, relying primarily on techniques like dictionary encoding and prefix-based partition pruning. In recent work, we introduced string fingerprints - a lightweight secondary index structure designed to approximate LIKE predicates, albeit with false positives. This approach is particularly compelling for columnar query engines, where fingerprints can help reduce both compute and I/O overhead. We show that string fingerprints can be optimized for specific workloads using mixed-integer optimization, and that they can generalize to unseen table predicates. On an IMDb column evaluated in DuckDB v1.3, this yields table-scan speedups of up to 1.36$\times$.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Estimation of Jaccard Containment and Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating the containment and similarity between two sets using only random samples from each set, without relying on sketches or full data access. The study introduces a binomial model for predicting the overlap between samples, demonstrating that it is both accurate and practical when sample sizes are small compared to the original sets. The paper compares this model to previous approaches and shows that it provides better estimates under the considered conditions. It also analyzes the statistical properties of the estimator, including error bounds and sample size requirements needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy and confidence. The framework is extended to estimate set similarity, and the paper provides guidance for applying these methods in large scale data systems where only partial or sampled data is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tables are fundamental in domains such as finance, healthcare, and public administration, yet real-world table tasks often involve noise, structural heterogeneity, and semantic complexity--issues underexplored in existing research that primarily targets clean academic datasets. This survey focuses on LLM-based Table Agents, which aim to automate table-centric workflows by integrating preprocessing, reasoning, and domain adaptation. We define five core competencies--C1: Table Structure Understanding, C2: Table and Query Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the Text-to-SQL Agent reveals a performance gap between academic benchmarks and real-world scenarios, especially for open-source models. Finally, we provide actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.</description>

      <title>QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-Preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been widely adopted in many scientific domains because it can address the challenges in storing, transferring, and analyzing unprecedented amounts of scientific data. Although error-bounded lossy compression offers general data distortion control by enforcing strict error bounds on raw data, it may fail to meet the quality requirements on the results of downstream analysis, a.k.a. Quantities of Interest (QoIs), derived from raw data. This may lead to uncertainties and even misinterpretations in scientific discoveries, significantly limiting the use of lossy compression in practice. In this paper, we propose QPET, a novel, versatile, and portable framework for QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression, which overcomes the challenges of modeling diverse QoIs by leveraging numerical strategies. QPET features (1) high portability to multiple existing lossy compressors, (2) versatile preservation to most differentiable univariate and multivariate QoIs, and (3) significant compression improvements in QoI-preservation tasks. Experiments with six real-world datasets demonstrate that integrating QPET into state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressors can gain 2x to 10x compression speedups of existing QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression solutions, up to 1000% compression ratio improvements to general-purpose compressors, and up to 133% compression ratio improvements to existing QoI-integrated scientific compressors.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Checking Mixed Isolation Levels for SQL Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concurrent accesses to databases are typically grouped in transactions which define units of work that should be isolated from other concurrent computations and resilient to failures. Modern databases provide different levels of isolation for transactions that correspond to different trade-offs between consistency and throughput. Quite often, an application can use transactions with different isolation levels at the same time. In this work, we investigate the problem of testing isolation level implementations in databases, i.e., checking whether a given execution composed of multiple transactions adheres to the prescribed isolation level semantics. We particularly focus on transactions formed of SQL queries and the use of multiple isolation levels at the same time. We show that many restrictions of this problem are NP-complete and provide an algorithm which is exponential-time in the worst-case, polynomial-time in relevant cases, and practically efficient.</description>

      <title>OmniSQL: Synthesizing High-quality Text-to-SQL Data at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, plays a crucial role in enabling non-experts to interact with databases. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text-to-SQL performance, existing approaches face notable limitations in real-world text-to-SQL applications. Prompting-based methods often depend on closed-source LLMs, which are expensive, raise privacy concerns, and lack customization. Fine-tuning-based methods, on the other hand, suffer from poor generalizability due to the limited coverage of publicly available training data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel and scalable text-to-SQL data synthesis framework for automatically synthesizing large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets without extensive human intervention. Using this framework, we introduce SynSQL-2.5M, the first million-scale text-to-SQL dataset, containing 2.5 million samples spanning over 16,000 synthetic databases. Each sample includes a database, SQL query, natural language question, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solution. Leveraging SynSQL-2.5M, we develop OmniSQL, a powerful open-source text-to-SQL model available in three sizes: 7B, 14B, and 32B. Extensive evaluations across nine datasets demonstrate that OmniSQL achieves state-of-the-art performance, matching or surpassing leading closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3, despite its smaller size. We release all code, datasets, and models to support further research.</description>

      <title>ContextCache: Context-Aware Semantic Cache for Multi-Turn Queries in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses. However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries, lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings. This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally, cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM conversational applications.</description>

      <title>Bias-Aware Mislabeling Detection via Decoupled Confident Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful tool to enhance data reliability.</description>
