      <title>Universal scaling of shear thickening suspensions under acoustic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning shear thickening behavior is a longstanding problem in the field of dense suspensions. Acoustic perturbations offer a convenient way to control shear thickening in real time, opening the door to a new class of smart materials. However, complete control over shear thickening requires a quantitative description for how suspension viscosity varies under acoustic perturbation. Here, we achieve this goal by experimentally probing suspensions with acoustic perturbations and incorporating their effect on the suspension viscosity into a universal scaling framework where the viscosity is described by a scaling function, which captures a crossover from the frictionless jamming critical point to a frictional shear jamming critical point. Our analysis reveals that the effect of acoustic perturbations may be explained by the introduction of an effective interparticle repulsion whose magnitude is roughly equal to the acoustic energy density. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this scaling framework may be leveraged to produce explicit predictions for the viscosity of a dense suspension under acoustic perturbation. Our results demonstrate the utility of the scaling framework for experimentally manipulating shear thickening systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Memory in Driven Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steadily shearing a non-Brownian suspension forms a memory of direction in its structure, while periodically shearing it forms a memory of amplitude. Our experiments show that these memories coexist and compete within a limited memory capacity. A specific oscillatory amplitude, previously associated with a critical transition, suppresses the directional (fore-aft) asymmetry. A similar picture is known in amorphous solids. We propose that these competing kinds of memory are a motif for non-equilibrium systems coupled to a scalar drive and are a basic example of interplay between memories.</description>

      <title>Modelling of magnetic vortex microdisc dynamics under varying magnetic field in biological viscoelastic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically driven microparticles provide a versatile platform for probing and manipulating biological systems, yet the physical framework governing their actuation in complex environments remains only partially explored. Within the field of cellular magneto-mechanical stimulation, vortex microdiscs have emerged as particularly promising candidates for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we introduce a simplified two-dimensional model describing the magneto-mechanical response of such particles embedded in viscoelastic media under varying magnetic fields. Using a Maxwell description of the medium combined with simplified elasticity assumptions, we derive analytical expressions and support them with numerical simulations of particle motion under both oscillating and rotating magnetic fields. Our results show that rotating fields typically induce oscillatory dynamics and that the transition to asynchronous motion occurs at a critical frequency determined by viscosity and stiffness. The amplitude and phase of this motion is governed by the competition between magnetic and viscoelastic contributions, with particle motion being strongly impaired when the latter dominate. Energy-based considerations further demonstrate that, within the frequency range explored of few tens of Hertz, no heat is generated -- distinguishing this approach from magnetic hyperthermia -- while the elastic energy transferred to the surrounding medium is, in principle, sufficient to perturb major cellular processes. This work provides a simple framework to anticipate the first-order influence of rheological properties on magnetically driven microdisc dynamics, thereby enabling a better understanding of their impact in cells or extracellular materials and bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical modelling.</description>

      <title>Optimal run-tumble navigation in disordered landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active navigation in disordered media is governed by the interplay between self-propulsion and environmental constraints. Using the chemotaxis of E. coli in agar gels as a model system, we uncover a universal trade-off between persistence and obstacle avoidance that dictates optimal search strategies. We find that populations evolving under pressure for rapid expansion adapt by shortening their mean run time ({\tau}_f), counter to the intuition that longer runs always favor faster migration. Controlled experiments with a tunable strain confirm a non-monotonic relationship between run time and chemotactic velocity, with a clear optimum that shifts with environmental trap density. At the single-agent level, we identify and characterize a key motility state: transient trapping in the gel's pores. A minimal theoretical model, integrating run-tumble and run-trap dynamics, explains the optimum as a consequence of the antagonistic scaling of the diffusion coefficient (increasing with {\tau}_f) and the chemotactic bias coefficient (decreasing with {\tau}_f). This work establishes a general principle for the optimization of active matter transport in complex and obstructed environments.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fokker-Planck equation for the active Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle suspended in a non-Markovian environment. The particle is additionally subjected to external forces, such as harmonic confinement and a magnetic field. Motivated by the importance of understanding the non-Markovian behavior of complex environments, we examine the impact of a viscoelastic medium by employing the Jeffrey fluid framework for modeling the particle motion, which effectively captures both viscous and elastic contributions of the environment. Within this model, we explicitly derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for each case. Building on this, we extend the analysis to general non-Markovian framework and derive the corresponding generalized Fokker-Planck equation for a free active particle. Furthermore, we obtain the probability distribution function valid for arbitrary memory kernel under various conditions, including both free and confined motion with and without a magnetic field. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive formalism for the probabilistic description of an active particle subjected to non-Markovian memory effects. This formulation provides a solid basis for analyzing the dynamics of an active particle in a non-Markovian environment, such as mucus and polymer solutions, and further allows the study of relaxation in confined geometries and responses to external fields.</description>

      <title>Anonymous leadership and stochastic resonance in collectives of self-propelled robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of an anonymous leader on a collective of self-propelled robots using Kilobot experiments and numerical simulations. A single leader alternated deterministically between clockwise and counterclockwise motion, while the other robots followed a stochastic majority rule. Although the leader does not change global order, it induces correlations with the collective response that peak at intermediate perturbation levels, resembling stochastic resonance. Simulations confirm that this resonance occurs when the leader's reversal period matches the mean residence time of the unperturbed system. Our results contribute to understanding decision-making in active matter and suggesting principles for steering robotic swarms with minimal leadership input.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Physics-Informed Predictions of Degradation Behavior of Polymeric Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global transition to hydrogen-based energy infrastructures faces significant hurdles. Chief among these are the high costs and sustainability issues associated with acid-based proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells offer promising cost-effective alternatives, yet their widespread adoption is limited by rapid degradation in alkaline environments. Here, we develop a framework that integrates mechanistic insights with machine learning, enabling the identification of generalized degradation behavior across diverse polymeric AEM chemistries and operating conditions. Our model successfully predicts long-term hydroxide conductivity degradation (up to 10,000 hours) from minimal early-time experimental data. This capability significantly reduces experimental burdens and may expedite the design of high-performance, durable AEM materials.</description>

      <title>ToPolyAgent: AI Agents for Coarse-Grained Topological Polymer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Curvature dependent dynamics of a bacterium confined in a giant unilamellar vesicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the positional behavior of a single bacterium confined within a vesicle by measuring the probability of locating the bacterium at a certain distance from the vesicle boundary. We observe that the distribution is bi-exponential in nature. Near the boundary, the distribution exhibits rapid exponential decay, transitioning to a slower exponential decay, and eventually becoming uniform further away from the boundary. The length scales associated with the decay are found to depend on the confinement radius. We interpret these observations using molecular simulations and analytical calculations based on the Fokker-Planck equation for an Active Brownian Particle model. Our findings reveal that the small length scale is strongly influenced by the translational diffusion coefficient, while the larger length scale is governed by rotational diffusivity and self-propulsion. These results are explained in terms of two dimensionless parameters that explicitly include the confinement radius. The scaling behavior predicted analytically for the observed length scales is confirmed through simulations.</description>

      <title>The elusive fluid-and-crystal coexistence state in simulations of monodisperse, hard-sphere colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine why simulations replicating monodisperse purely-repulsive hard sphere (MPRHS) theory fail to produce explicit, spontaneous, equilibrium coexistence of fluid and crystal domains. MPRHS fluid-to-solid phase transitions are well established, as is prediction of the coexistence region via thermodynamic theory. Consensus holds that the MPRHS coexistence region is metastable, where nucleation governs crystallization. Our review explores the abundant physics and rheology literature for MPRHS, revealing two related observations: We find clear mechanistic explanation for crystallization of MPRHS, and that producing spontaneous MPRHS coexistence in simulations is notoriously difficult. Frenkel's mechanism-that vibrational entropy gains offset configurational entropy losses to drive MPRHS phase transition-suggests system size is the fundamental simulation issue. Alder and Wainwright recognized this constraint and emphasized the merit of direct observation in simulations, of explicitly following an isotherm through the coexistence region. But with 1M particles, estimated nucleation time is 317M years. Recent large-scale simulations reinforce this, showing phase transition, but not reporting explicit phase separation. The ideal condition is a tractably-large system and minimal perturbation to exit metastability. Instead, brute force is often used to trigger nucleation and phase separation via seeding, pre-construction, or gravity. Some simulations do show brief spontaneous coexistence but a metastable crystal or fluid subsequently overtakes the system. Putatively-hard WCA potentials allow extra free volume, lowering osmotic pressure and the energy barrier, and avoiding the strict short/long-range entropy challenge. Overall, rheological and computational demonstration of Frenkel's mechanism for MPRHS remains elusive, awaiting sufficiently large systems of sufficiently hard MPRHS.</description>

      <title>Simulating non-Brownian suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interactions are commonly modeled using no-slip boundary conditions. However, small deviations from these conditions can significantly alter the dynamics of suspensions and particles, especially at the micro and nano scales. This work presents a robust implicit solvent method for simulating non-colloidal suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions. Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium evaporation of Lennard-Jones fluids: Enskog-Vlasov theory and Hertz-Knudsen model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by both the assumptions underlying the Vlasov forcing term and the approximation introduced by the Enskog collision term for short-range molecular interactions. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, transport coefficients, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The results confirm that deviations from the Maxwellian distribution persist in the vapour region, indicating limitations of the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation under pronounced non-equilibrium conditions. This work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling.</description>

      <title>General approach for partitioning and phase separation in macromolecular coexisting phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partitioning of (bio)materials in polymeric mixtures is a key phenomenon both in cellular environments, as well as in industrial applications. In cells, several macromolecules are suspended within different biomolecular phases. On the other hand, the coexistence of polymeric aqueous phases has been exploited for the extraction and purification of (bio)materials suspended in water. Despite its relevance, key physical and chemical properties controlling the phase behavior of these complex systems are still lacking. Here, we have developed a classical density functional theory approach for describing the phase coexistence and partitioning of an arbitrary number of polymers and suspended materials. As a case example, we focus on a binary mixture of phase separating polymers in which a third material is dispersed. We explore the effect of size ratios and affinities between the different materials and address their distribution and coexisting densities, and find optimal conditions for partitioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important goal for swarming research is to create methods for predicting, controlling and designing swarms, which produce collective dynamics that solve a problem through emergent and stable pattern formation, without the need for constant intervention, and with a minimal number of parameters and controls. One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target.</description>
