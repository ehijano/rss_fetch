      <title>Quantum Data Management: From Theory to Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a transformative tool for future data management. Classical problems in database domains, including query optimization, data integration, and transaction management, have recently been addressed using quantum computing techniques. This tutorial aims to establish the theoretical foundation essential for enhancing methodologies and practical implementations in this line of research. Moreover, this tutorial takes a forward-looking approach by delving into recent strides in quantum internet technologies and the nonlocality theory. We aim to shed light on the uncharted territory of future data systems tailored for the quantum internet.</description>

      <title>iSummary: Workload-based, Personalized Summaries for Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion in the size and the complexity of the available Knowledge Graphs on the web has led to the need for efficient and effective methods for their understanding and exploration. Semantic summaries have recently emerged as methods to quickly explore and understand the contents of various sources. However in most cases they are static not incorporating user needs and preferences and cannot scale. In this paper we present iSummary a novel scalable approach for constructing personalized summaries. As the size and the complexity of the Knowledge Graphs for constructing personalized summaries prohibit efficient summary construction, in our approach we exploit query logs. The main idea behind our approach is to exploit knowledge captured in existing user queries for identifying the most interesting resources and linking them constructing as such highquality personalized summaries. We present an algorithm with theoretical guarantees on the summarys quality linear in the number of queries available in the query log. We evaluate our approach using three realworld datasets and several baselines showing that our approach dominates other methods in terms of both quality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>OTClean: Data Cleaning for Conditional Independence Violations using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring Conditional Independence (CI) constraints is pivotal for the development of fair and trustworthy machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce \sys, a framework that harnesses optimal transport theory for data repair under CI constraints. Optimal transport theory provides a rigorous framework for measuring the discrepancy between probability distributions, thereby ensuring control over data utility. We formulate the data repair problem concerning CIs as a Quadratically Constrained Linear Program (QCLP) and propose an alternating method for its solution. However, this approach faces scalability issues due to the computational cost associated with computing optimal transport distances, such as the Wasserstein distance. To overcome these scalability challenges, we reframe our problem as a regularized optimization problem, enabling us to develop an iterative algorithm inspired by Sinkhorn's matrix scaling algorithm, which efficiently addresses high-dimensional and large-scale data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed methods, showcasing their practical utility in real-world data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. Furthermore, we provide comparisons with traditional approaches, highlighting the superiority of our techniques in terms of preserving data utility while ensuring adherence to the desired CI constraints.</description>

      <title>Enumeration for MSO-Queries on Compressed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a linear preprocessing and output-linear delay enumeration algorithm for MSO-queries over trees that are compressed in the well-established grammar-based framework. Time bounds are measured with respect to the size of the compressed representation of the tree. Our result extends previous work on the enumeration of MSO-queries over uncompressed trees and on the enumeration of document spanners over compressed text documents.</description>

      <title>VeriEQL: Bounded Equivalence Verification for Complex SQL Queries with Integrity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of SQL query equivalence checking is important in various real-world applications (including query rewriting and automated grading) that involve complex queries with integrity constraints; yet, state-of-the-art techniques are very limited in their capability of reasoning about complex features (e.g., those that involve sorting, case statement, rich integrity constraints, etc.) in real-life queries. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first SMT-based approach and its implementation, VeriEQL, capable of proving and disproving bounded equivalence of complex SQL queries. VeriEQL is based on a new logical encoding that models query semantics over symbolic tuples using the theory of integers with uninterpreted functions. It is simple yet highly practical -- our comprehensive evaluation on over 20,000 benchmarks shows that VeriEQL outperforms all state-of-the-art techniques by more than one order of magnitude in terms of the number of benchmarks that can be proved or disproved. VeriEQL can also generate counterexamples that facilitate many downstream tasks (such as finding serious bugs in systems like MySQL and Apache Calcite).</description>

      <title>Text classification of column headers with a controlled vocabulary: leveraging LLMs for metadata enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional dataset retrieval systems index on metadata information rather than on the data values. Thus relying primarily on manual annotations and high-quality metadata, processes known to be labour-intensive and challenging to automate. We propose a method to support metadata enrichment with topic annotations of column headers using three Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT-3.5, GoogleBard and GoogleGemini. We investigate the LLMs ability to classify column headers based on domain-specific topics from a controlled vocabulary. We evaluate our approach by assessing the internal consistency of the LLMs, the inter-machine alignment, and the human-machine agreement for the topic classification task. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e. dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our results suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard for internal consistency as well as LLM-human-alignment. Interestingly, we found that context had no impact on the LLMs performances. This work proposes a novel approach that leverages LLMs for text classification using a controlled topic vocabulary, which has the potential to facilitate automated metadata enrichment, thereby enhancing dataset retrieval and the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) of research data on the Web.</description>
