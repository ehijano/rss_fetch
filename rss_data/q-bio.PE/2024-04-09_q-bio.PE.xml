      <title>Quantifying age-specific household contacts in Aotearoa New Zealand for infectious disease modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accounting for population age structure and age-specific contact patterns is crucial for accurate modelling of human infectious disease dynamics and impact. A common approach is to use synthetic contact matrices, which estimate the number of contacts between individuals of different ages in specific settings. These contact matrices are frequently based on data collected from populations with very different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics from the population of interest. Here we use a comprehensive household composition dataset based on New Zealand census and administrative data to construct household contact matrices and a synthetic population that can be used for modelling. We investigate the behaviour of a compartment-based and an agent-based epidemic model parameterised using this data, compared to a commonly used synthetic contact matrix. We find that using the household composition data leads to lower attack rates in older age groups compared to using the synthetic contact matrix. This difference becomes larger when household transmission is more dominant relative to non-household transmission. In addition, explicitly account for household structure in an agent-based models leads to lower attack rates at all ages. We provide electronic versions of the synthetic population and household contact matrix for other researchers to use in infectious disease models.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics. So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication). In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our narrative starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our metaphor is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <title>The study of periphery uniqueness and balance in ecological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of ecological networks is crucial for modern conservation biology, addressing habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, especially in complex regions. These networks, including corridors, sources, and nodes, are key for species movement and ecosystem functioning. The Periphery Analysis Model (PAM) is introduced as a new approach to study the periphery of these networks, focusing on peripheral nodes' role in environmental change response and network resilience. PAM, drawing from graph theory, complex network analysis, and landscape ecology, uses the Periphery Uniqueness Index (PuI) and the Periphery Balance Index (PbI) to measure peripheral nodes' attributes and balance. It also offers derived indices for a detailed understanding of the periphery's influence. By revealing the periphery's defining characteristics, PAM enhances knowledge of ecological networks' structural features, providing insights for biodiversity, connectivity, and ecosystem health. The research encourages integrating PAM into conservation strategies to inform policy for ecosystem preservation amid environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Phylogeny of Large Language Models and Predicting their Performances in Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method applying phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models to explore their finetuning relationships, and predict their performance characteristics. By leveraging the phylogenetic distance metric, we construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture distinct LLM families (across a set of 77 open-source and 22 closed models). Furthermore, phylogenetic distance predicts performances in benchmarks (we test MMLU and ARC), thus enabling a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. The approach translates genetic concepts to machine learning, offering tools to infer LLM development, relationships, and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</description>

      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>
