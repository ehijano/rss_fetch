      <title>Constitutive properties for isotropic energies in ideal nonlinear elasticity for solid materials: numerical evidences for invertibility and monotonicity in different stress-strain pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a service for the solid mechanics community we gather in this paper constitutive properties of a collective list of isotropic elastic energies for compressible materials. Of interest to us are the invertibility and monotonicity of certain stress-strain pairs. The calculations are done numerically by our own evaluation algorithm and presented in a yes/no-table. Such an overview has been missing up to now. It is intended to expand the table with further energies as time goes on and updates will be found on arxive.</description>

      <title>Is the Lorenz Gauge a Choice? Gauge Freedom and the Structure of Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In undergraduate electromagnetism courses, the Lorenz gauge condition is often presented as a convenient mathematical choice that decouples the wave equations for the scalar and vector potentials. While true, this presentation may leave students with the impression that the condition is entirely arbitrary. This Note explores the fundamental structure of gauge invariance, demonstrating that the Lorenz condition is not an ad-hoc imposition but rather the most elegant and natural simplification afforded by the theory's inherent gauge freedom. We explicitly show how the gauge function itself transforms, proving that one can always choose a gauge in which the Lorenz condition holds. This approach aims to transform the topic from a formal trick into an instructive example of the structure of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Novel distributional Laplacians and a Coulomb-gauge problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel distributional Laplacians of an arsinh function and a related logarithm function are derived. The method used to establish the former result is employed in a calculation of the gauge transformation function for the case of a uniformly moving point charge.</description>

      <title>Frequency Dependence of the Displacement Current Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Maxwell's equations, the electric field can be expressed as the sum of the Coulombic field associated with the electric charge and the induced field associated with the time variation of the magnetic field from Faraday's law. The same holds true for the displacement current densities, which are the time-derivatives of the respective electric fields. In the case of an AC current of constant amplitude, the amplitude of the displacement current density associated with the Coulombic field is independent of the frequency. In contrast, the displacement current density associated with the induced field is very small at low frequencies, increasing initially as the square of the frequency, and ultimately becomes of the same order of magnitude as that of the Coulombic field.</description>

      <title>EEG Brain mapping based on the Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the EEG brain mapping technique based on the Duffing oscillator. For this purpose, we used EEG signals recorded from two musicians and two audience members in a music experiment. The Duffing oscillator was used to detect weak signals in the EEG signals. The frequency values of the weak signal were searched between 12 Hz and 37 Hz in all EEG channels of the participants. Then, topographical maps of the brain were generated according to the numbers of these weak signals detected. The results show that Duffing oscillator-based weak signal detection is a very effective tool for brain mapping. It shows that this method has great potential to help study various pathological conditions and understand the cognitive and behavioural functions of the human brain.</description>

      <title>Origin of the power-law profile in a core-collapsing galactic globular-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed galactic globular clusters reveal power-law structural profiles in the inner halos around the core-collapse stage. However, the origin of the power-law has not been explained in an acceptable manner. The present paper applies the Buckingham's Pi theorem to the orbit-averaged Fokker-Plank (OAFP) model of equal masses to study the inner-halo structure of a core-collapsing isotropic star cluster. We first prove that an infinite OAFP model evolves self-similarly because of the principle of covariance. We then show that the inner halo must form a power-law profile in a finite OAFP model that has complete similarity so that the principle of covariance and conservation laws hold. The conventional assumption that inner halos are self-similar and stationary is unnecessary to explain the power-law profiles.</description>
