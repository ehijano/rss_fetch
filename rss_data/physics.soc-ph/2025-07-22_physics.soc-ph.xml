      <title>The Order of Physical Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order legal relations specify the duties of legal actors. For instance, the duty not to trespass derives from a first-order law. Second-order legal relations generally concern the intentional, volitional acts of legal actors exercising legal powers to change first-order laws or legal relations. For example, a landowner may exercise a second-order power to change another legal actor's duty not to trespass into a legal permission to enter the landowner's property. This article adapts the notion of legal order to propose a theory of first- and higher-order physical laws, contending that current physical theories implicitly (and wrongly) assume that essentially all physical processes can be modeled using first-order laws. Incorporating second- and higher-order structures from legal models into physical theories provides a novel approach for framing problems in physics, such as the process of quantum measurement. Specifically, quantum measurement is better explained as a fundamentally second-order physical process that alters the underlying first-order physical "microlaws" governing the evolution of the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Apology of Green Digitalization in the Context of Information and Climate Feedback Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid accelerated digitalization, not only is the scale of data processing and storage increasing, but so too is the associated infrastructure load on the climate. Current climate models and environmental protocols almost entirely overlook the impact of information and communication technologies on the thermal and energy balance of the biosphere.
  This paper proposes the theory of information and climate feedback (ICF) as a new nonlinear model describing the loop of digitalization, energy consumption, the thermal footprint, the climatic response, and the vulnerability of digital infrastructure. The system is formalized via differential equations with delays and parameters of sensitivity, greenness, and phase stability.
  A multiscenario numerical analysis, phase reconstructions, and thermal cartography were conducted. Critical regimes, including digital overheating, fluctuational instability, and infrastructural collapse in the absence of adaptive measures, were identified.
  The paper concludes with the proposal of an international agreement titled the Green Digital Accord and a set of metrics for sustainable digitalization. This work integrates climatology, information technologies, and the political economy of sustainability.</description>

      <title>Green schoolyard investments influence local-level economic and equity outcomes through spatial-statistical modeling and geospatial analysis in urban contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investing in urban green schoolyards is becoming more popular around the world because they could enhance health, education, and community outcomes. There is still considerable debate regarding the impact of urban green schoolyards on economic growth, equity, and community stability, particularly when analyzed using spatial-statistical and geospatial methods. The current study focuses mostly on health or individual case results and avoids looking at broader economic and equality concerns. It also fails to effectively integrate all the methodological rigor and policy implications. Using GIS analysis and comparative spatial-statistical modeling, this study fills in the gaps by examining five essential recent studies, which included cases from the US, the Netherlands, and Australia. The study uses methods such as hedonic pricing, difference in differences, spatial econometrics, and participatory GIS to look carefully at changes in property values, equitable outcomes, and displacement risks in different metropolitan areas. Studies show that while investing in green schoolyards usually raises property values in the area (by 2, 5% in Denver and Los Angeles) and is beneficial for kids' health and development, these benefits are not equitably shared. Most of the time, wealthy neighborhoods obtain the biggest benefits. Displacement and gentrification are most likely to occur in areas with inadequate tenant protections. Examples from around the world show that policies that focus on equity, public ownership, and participatory planning are necessary to get the most out of everyone's benefits and keep people from being left out.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic consensus transitions in bounded-confidence dynamics on unbiased networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hegselmann-Krause model of opinion dynamics on sparse, unbiased networks generated via Wilson's algorithm, unveiling how network connectivity and confidence bounds jointly determine collective behavior. By systematically exploring the parameter space spanned by the confidence level $\epsilon$ and the mean degree density $\mu$, we construct comprehensive phase diagrams that classify the emergent steady states into different degrees of fragmentation and consensus. We uncover a nonmonotonic re-entrant transition where increased connectivity can paradoxically suppress consensus, and show that full unanimity is unattainable at low connectivity due to structural isolation. Convergence times exhibit two distinct slowdowns: a finite-size, connectivity-dependent resonance near $\epsilon \sim 1/N$, and a critical peak associated with the established fragmentation-to-consensus transition. While the critical confidence threshold $\epsilon_c$ stabilizes near 0.2 for large system sizes, finite-size effects and sparse connectivity significantly alter the dynamics and phase boundaries in smaller populations. Our results offer new insights into the interplay between network topology and opinion dynamics, and highlight conditions under which increased connectivity may hinder, rather than promote, consensus.</description>

      <title>A Century of Evolution in the Complexity of the United States Legal Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As societies confront increasingly complex regulatory demands in domains such as digital governance, climate policy, and public health, there is a pressing need to understand how legal systems evolve, where they concentrate regulatory attention, and how their institutional architectures shape capacity for adaptation. Yet, the long-term structural dynamics of law remain empirically underexplored. Here, we provide a versioned, machine-readable record of the United States Code (U.S. Code), the primary compilation of federal statutory law in the United States, covering the entire history of the Code from 1926 to 2023. We include not only the curated text in Code but also its structural and linguistic complexity: word counts, vocabulary statistics, hierarchical organization (titles, chapters, sections, subsections), and cross-references among titles. In this way, the dataset offers an empirical foundation for large-scale and long-term interdisciplinary analysis of the growth, reorganization, and internal logic of statutory systems. The dataset is released on GitHub with comprehensive documentation to support reuse across legal studies, data science, complexity research, and institutional analysis.</description>

      <title>Preventing an Extractive Green Hydrogen Industry: Risks and Benefits of Grid Expansion and Green Hydrogen in and for Kenya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the role of grid-connected hydrogen electrolyzers in advancing a cost-effective and in particular an equitable green hydrogen industry in Kenya to serve both domestic and international needs and markets. Using a multi-nodal capacity expansion model with county-level spatial resolution, we assess how electrolyzer deployment affects electricity cost, grid flexibility, and carbon intensity under various renewable and demand scenarios. Results show that electrolyzers enable up to 30 percent reduction in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and US\$460 million in cumulative system cost savings by 2050 compared to a business-as-usual scenario. As a flexible demand available to absorb surplus generation, electrolyzers reduce curtailment and support large-scale wind integration while still requiring a diverse mix of renewable electricity. The resulting hydrogen reaches a levelized cost of \$3.2 per kg by 2050, and its carbon intensity from electricity use falls below one kg carbon dioxide per kg of hydrogen, suggesting likely compliance with international certification thresholds. Benefits persist across all demand trajectories, though their scale depends on the pace of wind expansion. Spatial analyses reveal unequal distribution of infrastructure gains, underscoring the need for equity-oriented planning. These findings suggest that grid-integrated hydrogen, if planned in coordination with wind investment, transmission, and equitable infrastructure deployment, can reduce costs, support certification, and promote a more equitable model of hydrogen development. In other words, connecting electrolyzers to the grid will not only make green hydrogen in Kenya but also for Kenya.</description>

      <title>The Australian Vote: Transferable Voting, Its Limitations and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The voting systems known as Alternative Vote (AV) and Single Transferable Vote (STV) are extensively used for elections in Australia, possibly more than in any other jurisdiction. Often proposed as superior alternatives to Plurality and other common systems, they are also criticised by theoreticians for their vulnerability to paradoxical outcomes. It is argued these 'transferable voting' systems in fact operate to balance competing desiderata that attempt to distil the common notions of 'majority rule' and 'voter choice'. Among positive characteristics of AV is that its outcome is always a majority runoff between two candidates with substantial voter support, and that a Condorcet winner who gains at least one-third of votes is always elected. It is shown that in situations where a Condorcet winner is not elected, there always exists a monotonic shift producing a Condorcet cycle without changing the election outcome. A detailed analysis of non-monotonicity paradoxes in three-way contests is provided, aided by a two-dimensional spatial model where each candidate has a one-in-four probability of gaining an absolute majority of primary votes while there is a similar one-in-four probability that no candidate wins a majority. On such a model it is shown non-monotonicities are latent in less than 3.5% of election scenarios (and conjectured to be less than 3%), and the close link between non-monotonicities and Condorcet cycles and instabilities is studied in more detail. Properties of multi-winner STV are also reviewed including a demonstration of the standard fact that STV becomes similar to a form of largest-remainder list voting in the special case where ballots are cast strictly by party allegiance. The argument that AV and STV exemplify the principle of voter choice while balancing absolute and relative concepts of majority-rule is made by reference to practice in Australian elections.</description>

      <title>Strategy Evolution in the Adoption of Conservation Tillage Technology under Time Preference Heterogeneity and Lemon Market: Insights from Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promotion of Conservation Tillage Technology (CTT) is critical for mitigating global soil degradation, yet their actual adoption rates remain substantially lower than anticipated targets. Existing research predominantly focuses on static factor analyses, failing to adequately capture the dynamic evolutionary mechanisms of farmer strategic interactions and the impacts of information asymmetries in agricultural markets. This study constructs an evolutionary game model integrating heterogeneous time preferences and lemon market effects to reveal the dynamic equilibrium of technology adoption within farmer groups operating under bounded rationality. Key findings indicate that farmers with high time preferences significantly impede CTT adoption due to the excessive discounting of long-term benefits. Furthermore, the lemon market effect dictates the system's equilibrium states: 1) When the lemon market benefit ($P$) exceeds the lemon market loss ($Q$) ($P &gt; Q$), stable tripartite coexistence of adoption strategies emerges; 2) When $P &lt; Q$, the system evolves unpredictably, exhibiting dynamics characterized by heteroclinic cycles; 3) At the critical threshold $P = Q$, the system transforms into a conservative Hamiltonian system, yielding stable periodic oscillation solutions. Based on these insights, policy recommendations are proposed: implementing ecological certification schemes to mitigate information asymmetry, offering subsidies and insurance to reduce adoption risks, and utilizing environmental taxes to internalize the negative externalities associated with conventional tillage. This research not only provides a dynamic analytical paradigm for the diffusion of green agricultural technologies but also furnishes a theoretical foundation for designing sustainable agricultural policies in developing countries.</description>

      <title>A meta-analysis of impact factors of particle physics journals using NASA/ADS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate the 2025 impact factors for 16 journals in Particle Physics (and related areas such as Nuclear Physics) using citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System). We then compare them to the official impact factors calculated by Clarivate. We also compare these impact factors to the median-based impact factors introduced in a previous work. We do not find any systematic bias between the ADS and official impact factors. We find the maximum relative difference between official and median-based impact factors for PTEP and Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science. For PTEP, this difference is due to one outlier, viz Particle Data Group with over 1400 citations in the last two years. Similarly for Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science, the difference is due to a review paper on Hubble tension and early dark energy with over 100 citations in the past two years. Both these papers have significantly elevated the official impact factors above its median value.</description>

      <title>Does the draw matter in an incomplete round-robin tournament? The case of the UEFA Champions League</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental reform has been introduced in the 2024/25 season of club competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA): the well-established group stage has been replaced by an incomplete round-robin format. In this format, the 36 teams are ranked in a single league table, but play against only a subset of the competitors. While this innovative change has highlighted that the incomplete round-robin tournament is a reasonable alternative to the standard design of allocating the teams into round-robin groups, the characteristics of the new format remain unexplored. Our paper contributes to this topic by using simulations to compare the uncertainty generated by the draw in the old format with that in the new format of the UEFA Champions League. We develop a method to break down the impact of the 2024/25 reform into various components for each team. The new format is found to decrease the overall effect of the draw. However, this reduction can mainly be attributed to the inaccurate seeding system used by UEFA. When teams are seeded based on their actual strength, the impact of the draw is about the same in a tournament with an incomplete round-robin league or a group stage.</description>

      <title>Researcher Population Pyramids for Tracking Global Demographic and Gender Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustainability of the global academic ecosystem relies on researcher demographics and gender balance, yet assessing these dynamics in a timely manner for policy is challenging. Here, we propose a researcher population pyramids framework for tracking global demographic and gender trajectories using publication data. This framework provides a timely snapshot of historical and present demographics and gender balance, revealing three contrasting research systems: Emerging systems (e.g., Arab countries) exhibit high researcher inflows with widening gender gaps in cumulative productivity; Mature systems (e.g., the United States) show modest inflows with narrowing gender gaps; and Rigid systems (e.g., Japan) lag in both. Furthermore, by simulating future scenarios, the framework makes potential trajectories visible. If 2023 demographic patterns persist, Arab countries' systems could resemble mature or even rigid ones by 2050. Our framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for policymakers worldwide to foster sustainable talent pipelines and gender equality in academia.</description>

      <title>PhysGym: Benchmarking LLMs in Interactive Physics Discovery with Controlled Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce PhysGym, a novel benchmark suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific reasoning in interactive physics environments. PhysGym's primary contribution lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. PhysGym provides standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.</description>

      <title>Astrotourism for Development: An Overview of Resources from the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrotourism has emerged as a powerful cross sectoral tool to promote science education, sustainable economic development, and cultural exchange. Recognising its potential, the International Astronomical Union's Office of Astronomy for Development (IAU OAD) has developed a suite of openly accessible resources to support individuals and institutions interested in implementing astrotourism initiatives globally. These resources also encourage individuals and existing businesses to broaden their offerings to include activities that use the night sky as a backdrop, such as food experiences, wellness practices, and cultural exploration. This paper offers a comprehensive summary of these resources, available on the OAD's Astrotourism Portal, and situates them within the broader context of astronomy for development work. The paper is targeted at educators, policymakers, tourism operators, grassroots organisers, and entrepreneurs, providing guidance on how they can foster inclusive, locally grounded, and sustainable astrotourism efforts, particularly in underresourced or emerging contexts.</description>

      <title>A network and machine learning approach to detect Value Added Tax fraud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Value Added Tax (VAT) fraud erodes public revenue and puts legitimate businesses at a disadvantaged position thereby impacting inequality. Identifying and combating VAT fraud before it occurs is therefore important for welfare. This paper proposes flexible machine learning algorithms which detect fraudulent transactions, utilising the information provided by the complex VAT network structure of a large dimension. VAT fraud detection is implemented through a combination of a suitably constructed Laplacian matrix with classification algorithms that rely on scalable machine learning techniques. The method is implemented on the universe of Bulgarian VAT data and detects around 50 percent of the VAT fraud, outperforming well-known techniques that ignore the information provided by the network of VAT transactions. Importantly, the proposed methods are automated, and can be implemented following the taxpayers submission of their VAT returns. This allows tax revenue authorities to prevent large losses of tax revenues through performing early identification of fraud between business-to-business transactions within the VAT system.</description>

      <title>The simpliciality of higher-order networks</title>

Abstract: Higher-order networks are widely used to describe complex systems in which interactions can involve more than two entities at once. In this paper, we focus on inclusion within higher-order networks, referring to situations where specific entities participate in an interaction, and subsets of those entities also interact with each other. Traditional modeling approaches to higher-order networks tend to either not consider inclusion at all (e.g., hypergraph models) or explicitly assume perfect and complete inclusion (e.g., simplicial complex models). To allow for a more nuanced assessment of inclusion in higher-order networks, we introduce the concept of "simpliciality" and several corresponding measures. Contrary to current modeling practice, we show that empirically observed systems rarely lie at either end of the simpliciality spectrum. In addition, we show that generative models fitted to these datasets struggle to capture their inclusion structure. These findings suggest new modeling directions for the field of higher-order network science.</description>

      <title>Unveiling connectivity patterns of railway timetables through complex network theory and Infomap clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09214</link>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to analysing railway timetable connectivity using complex network theory and the Infomap clustering algorithm. By transforming railway timetables into network representations, we examine the connectivity and efficiency of the Norwegian railway system for the timetables of the current 2024 year and for a future timetable of year 2033. We define and apply the Timetable Connectivity Index, a comprehensive measure that evaluates the overall connectivity based on the number of services, travel times, and the hierarchical structure of the network. The analysis is conducted across three distinct network spaces: Stops, Stations, and Changes, with both unweighted and weighted networks. Our results reveal key insights into how infrastructural developments, service frequencies, and travel time adjustments influence network connectivity. The findings provide valuable insights for railway planners and operators, aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of train networks.</description>
