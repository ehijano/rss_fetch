      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass estimates derived from galactic rotation curves must account for past accretion histories of galaxies. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>

      <title>Synoptic Wide-field EVN--e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) -- I. First steps towards commensal surveys with VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high angular resolution and sensitivity of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offer a unique tool to identify and study active galactic nuclei and star-formation activity over cosmic time. However, despite recent technical advances, such as multiple phase centre correlation, VLBI surveys have thus far been limited to either a few well-studied deep-fields or wide-areas to a relatively shallow depth. To enter the era of extensive statistical studies at high angular resolution, a significantly larger area of the sky must be observed to much better sensitivity with VLBI. The Synoptic Wide-field EVN--e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) is a proposed commensal observing mode for the EVN and e-MERLIN, where single-target principle investigator-led observations are re-correlated at the position of known radio sources within 12 arcmin of the pointing centre. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this methodology by detecting a 5.6 mJy core-jet object at 1.7 GHz that would have otherwise been lost from the parent data set. This is the first object to be recovered as part of the SWEEPS pilot programme, which highlights the potential for increasing sample sizes of VLBI-detected radio sources with commensal observing modes in the near future.</description>

      <title>On the detection of stellar wakes in the Milky Way: a deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to poor observational constraints on the low-mass end of the subhalo mass function, the detection of dark matter (DM) subhalos on sub-galactic scales would provide valuable information about the nature of DM. Stellar wakes, induced by passing DM subhalos, encode information about the mass of the inducing perturber and thus serve as an indirect probe for the DM substructure within the Milky Way (MW). Our aim is to assess the viability and performance of deep learning searches for stellar wakes in the Galactic stellar halo caused by DM subhalos of varying mass. We simulate massive objects (subhalos) moving through a homogeneous medium of DM and star particles, with phase-space parameters tailored to replicate the conditions of the Galaxy at a specific distance from the Galactic center. The simulation data is used to train deep neural networks with the purpose of inferring both the presence and mass of the moving perturber, and assess subhalo detectability in varying conditions of the Galactic stellar and DM halos. We find that our binary classifier is able to infer the presence of subhalos, showing non-trivial performance down to a subhalo mass of $5 \times 10^7 \rm \, M_\odot$. We also find that our binary classifier is generalisable to datasets describing subhalo orbits at different Galactocentric distances. In a multiple-hypothesis case, we are able to discern between samples containing subhalos of different masses. Out of the phase-space observables available to us, we conclude that overdensity and velocity divergence are the most important features for subhalo detection performance.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: The highly overdense system BR1202-0725 at z $\sim$ 4.7. A double AGN with fast outflows plus eight companion galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distant quasars (QSOs) in galaxy overdensities are considered key actors in the evolution of the early Universe. In this work, we studied the kinematic and physical properties of the BR1202-0725 system at z=4.7, one of the most overdense fields known in the early Universe, consisting of a QSO, a submillimeter galaxy (SMG), and three Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters. We used data from the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to analyze the rest-frame optical emission of each source in the system. We estimated a bolometric luminosity of log($L_{\rm bol}/$[erg/s]) = 47.2 $\pm$ 0.4 and a black hole mass of log($M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot$) = 10.1 $\pm$ 0.5 for the QSO, which are consistent with previous measurements obtained with ground-based observations. The NIRSpec spectra of the SMG revealed instead unexpected [OIII] and H$\alpha$+[NII] profiles. The overall [OIII] line profile is blue-shifted by more than 700 km/s relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Additionally, both the [OIII] and H$\alpha$+[NII] lines show prominent broad (1300 km/s), blueshifted wings associated with outflowing ionized gas. The analysis of NIRSpec and X-ray observations indicates that the SMG likely hosts an accreting supermassive black hole as supported by the following results: (i) the excitation diagnostic diagram is consistent with ionization from an active galactic nucleus (AGN); (ii) the X-ray luminosity is higher than $10^{44}$ erg/s; and (iii) it hosts a fast outflow ($v_{\rm out}$ = 5000 km/s), comparable to those observed in luminous QSOs. Therefore, the QSO-SMG pair represents one of the highest-redshift double AGN to date, with a projected separation of 24 kpc. Finally, we investigated the environment of this system and found four new galaxies at the same redshift of the QSO and within a projected distance of 5 kpc from it. This overdense system includes at least ten galaxies in only 980 kpc$^2$.</description>

      <title>On the S-stars' Zone of Avoidance in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the origin and orbital evolution of S-stars in the Galactic Center using models of binary disruption and relaxation processes. We focus on explaining the recently discovered "zone of avoidance" in S-star orbital parameters, defined as a region where no S-stars are observed with pericenters $\log(r_p / {\rm AU}) \leq 1.57 + 2.6(1 - e)$ pc. We demonstrate that the observed S-star orbital distributions, including this zone of avoidance and their thermal eccentricity distribution, can be largely explained by continuous disruption of binaries near the central supermassive black hole, followed by orbital relaxation. Our models consider binaries originating from large scales (5--100 pc) and incorporate empirical distributions of binary properties. We simulate close encounters between binaries and the black hole, tracking the remnant stars' orbits. The initially highly eccentric orbits of disrupted binary remnants evolve due to non-resonant and resonant relaxation in the Galactic Center potential. While our results provide insights into the formation mechanism of S-stars, there are limitations, such as uncertainties in the initial binary population and mass-function and simplifications in our relaxation models. Despite these caveats, our study demonstrates the power of using S-star distributions to probe the dynamical history and environment of the central parsec of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Dark Galactic subhalos and the Gaia snail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark $\left(10^{6} M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}\right)$ Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semi-analytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old ($t \gtrsim 0.6$ Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of $\sim 0.1-0.5 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$ in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The importance of gas starvation in driving satellite quenching in galaxy groups at $z\sim 0.8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a Keck/DEIMOS survey to study satellite quenching in group environments at $z \sim 0.8$ within the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We target $11$ groups in the EGS with extended X-ray emission. We obtain high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for group member candidates, extending to depths over an order of magnitude fainter than existing DEEP2/DEEP3 spectroscopy. This depth enables the first spectroscopic measurement of the satellite quiescent fraction down to stellar masses of $\sim 10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at this redshift. By combining an infall-based environmental quenching model, constrained by the observed quiescent fractions, with infall histories of simulated groups from the IllustrisTNG100-1-Dark simulation, we estimate environmental quenching timescales ($\tau_{\mathrm{quench}}$) for the observed group population. At high stellar masses (${M}_{\star}=10^{10.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) we find that $\tau_{\mathrm{quench}} = 2.4\substack{+0.2 \\ -0.2}$ Gyr, which is consistent with previous estimates at this epoch. At lower stellar masses (${M}_{\star}=10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$), we find that $\tau_{\mathrm{quench}}=3.1\substack{+0.5 \\ -0.4}$ Gyr, which is shorter than prior estimates from photometry-based investigations. These timescales are consistent with satellite quenching via starvation, provided the hot gas envelope of infalling satellites is not stripped away. We find that the evolution in the quenching timescale between $0 \lt z \lt 1$ aligns with the evolution in the dynamical time of the host halo and the total cold gas depletion time. This suggests that the doubling of the quenching timescale in groups since $z\sim1$ could be related to the dynamical evolution of groups or a decrease in quenching efficiency via starvation with decreasing redshift.</description>

      <title>A Simulated Galaxy Laboratory: Exploring the Observational Effects on UV Spectral Absorption Line Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic for the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Down-the-barrel observations, where the absorption is measured against the galaxy itself, are commonly used to study feedback from galactic outflows and to make predictions about the leakage of HI ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. Nonetheless, the interpretation of these observations is challenging and observational compromises are often made in terms of signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, or the use of stacking analyses. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative assessment of UV absorption line measurement techniques by using mock observations of a hydrodynamical simulation. We use a simulated galaxy to create 22,500 spectra in the commonly used SiII lines while also modeling the signal-to-noise and spectral resolution of recent rest-frame UV galaxy surveys at both high and low redshifts. We show that the residual flux of absorption features is easily overestimated for single line measurements and for stacked spectra. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the partial covering model for estimating column densities from spectra and find under-predictions on average of 1.25 dex. We show that the under-prediction is likely caused by high-column-density sight-lines that are optically-thick to dust making them invisible in UV spectra.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime. III -- The triggering of active galactic nuclei peaks immediately after coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers have been shown to trigger AGN in the nearby universe, but the timescale over which this process happens remains unconstrained. The Multi-Model Merger Identifier (MUMMI) machine vision pipeline has been demonstrated to provide reliable predictions of time post-merger (T_PM) for galaxies selected from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared and Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) up to T_PM=1.76 Gyr after coalescence. By combining the post-mergers identified in UNIONS with pre-coalescence galaxy pairs, we can study the triggering of AGN throughout the merger sequence. AGN are identified using a range of complementary metrics: mid-IR colours, narrow emission lines and broad emission lines, which can be combined to provide insight into the demographics of dust and luminosity of the AGN population. Our main results are: 1) Regardless of the metric used, we find that the peak AGN excess (compared with a matched control sample) occurs immediately after coalescence, at 0 &lt; T_PM &lt; 0.16 Gyr. 2) The excess of AGN is observed until long after coalescence; both the mid-IR selected AGN and broad line AGN are more common than in the control sample even in the longest time bin of our sample (0.96 &lt; T_PM &lt; 1.76 Gyr). 3) The AGN excess is larger for more luminous and bolometrically dominant AGN, and we find that AGN in post-mergers are generally more luminous than secularly triggered events. 4) A deficit of broad line AGN in the pre-merger phase, that evolves into an excess in post-mergers is consistent with evolution of the covering fraction of nuclear obscuring material. Before coalescence, tidally triggered inflows increase the covering fraction of nuclear dust; in the post-merger regime feedback from the AGN clears (at least some of) this material. 5) The statistical peak in the triggering of starbursts occurs contemporaneously with AGN, within 0.16 Gyr of coalescence.</description>

      <title>Clusters, Clumps, Dust, &amp; Gas (CCDG) in NGC1614: Bench-marking Cluster Demographics in Extreme Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of young star clusters in a variety of galaxies have been used to constrain basic properties related to star-formation, such as the fraction of stars found in clusters (Gam) and the shape of the cluster mass function. However, the results can depend heavily on the reliability of the cluster age-dating process and other assumptions. One of the biggest challenges for successful age-dating lies in breaking the age-reddening degeneracy, where older, dust-free clusters and young, reddened clusters can have similar broad-band colors. While this degeneracy affects cluster populations in all galaxies, it is particularly challenging in dusty, extreme star-forming environments systems. We study the cluster demographics in the luminous infrared galaxy NGC1614 using Hubble imaging taken in 8 optical-NIR passbands. For age-dating, we adopt a spectral energy distribution fitting process that limits the maximum allowed reddening by region, and includes Ha photometry directly. We find that without these assumptions, essentially all clusters in the dust-free UV-bright arm which should have ages 50-250Myr are incorrectly assigned ages younger than 10Myr. We find this method greatly reduces the number of clusters in the youngest (tau&lt;10Myrs) age bin and shows a fairly uniform distribution of massive clusters, the most massive being few10^7M. A maximum likelihood fit shows that the cluster mass function is well fitted by a power-law with an index -1.8, with no statistically significant high-mass cutoff. We calculate the fraction of stars born in clusters to be Gam1-10=22.4+_5.7%. The fraction of stars in clusters decreases quickly over time, with Gam10-100= 4.5+_1.1% and Gam100-400=1.7+_0.4%, suggesting that clusters dissolve rapidly over the first ~0.5Gyr. The decreasing fraction of stars in clusters is consistent with the declining shape observed for the cluster age distribution.</description>

      <title>Environmental Evidence for Overly Massive Black Holes in Low Mass Galaxies and a Black Hole - Halo Mass Relation at $z \sim 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have unveiled faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high-redshift that provide insights on the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their coevolution with galaxies. However, disentangling stellar from AGN light in these sources is challenging. Here, we use an empirical approach to infer the average stellar mass of 6 faint broad line (BL) Halpha emitters at z = 4 - 5 with BH masses ~ 6 (4 - 15)x10^6 Msun, with a method independent of their spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the deep JWST/NIRcam grism survey ALT to measure the over-densities around BL-Halpha emitters and around a spectroscopic reference sample of ~300 galaxies. In our reference sample, we find that Mpc-scale over-density correlates with stellar mass, while pair counts are flat below ~50 kpc due to satellites. Their large-scale environments suggest that BL-Halpha emitters are hosted by galaxies with stellar masses ~5x10^7 Msun, ~40 times lower than those inferred from galaxy-only SED fits. Adding measurements around more luminous z~6 AGNs, we find tentative correlations between line width, BH mass and the over-density, suggestive of a steep BH to halo mass relation. The main implications are (1) when BH masses are taken at face value, we confirm extremely high BH to stellar mass ratios of ~10 %, (2) the low stellar mass galaxies hosting growing SMBHs are in tension with typical hydrodynamical simulations, except those without feedback, (3) a 1 % duty cycle implied by the host mass hints at super-Eddington accretion, which may imply over-estimated SMBH masses, (4) the masses are at odds with a high stellar density interpretation of the line broadening, (5) our results imply a diversity of galaxy masses, environments and SEDs among AGN samples, depending on their luminosity.</description>

      <title>Powerful nuclear outflows and circumgalactic medium shocks driven by the most luminous quasar in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the most luminous quasar known at $z=4.6$. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40 kpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster. We find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation surrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight times the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear region, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities reaching 13,000 km s$^{-1}$, one of the fastest discovered to date with an outflow rate of 2000 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of 6$\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ resulting in coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic luminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of the radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales. This provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical predictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the heating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>Solar System Migration Points to a Renewed Concept: Galactic Habitable Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical evidence suggests that the Sun was born near 5 kpc from the Galactic center, within the corotation radius of the Galactic bar, around 6-7 kpc. This presents challenges for outward migration due to the Jacobi energy constraint, preventing stars from easily overcoming the corotation barrier. In this study, we use test particle simulations to explore two possible migration pathways for the Sun: a "trapped" scenario, where the Sun's orbit was influenced by a slowing Galactic bar, and an "untrapped" scenario driven by dynamic spiral arms. Our results demonstrate that both mechanisms can explain how the Sun migrated from its birth radius (approximately 5 kpc) to its current orbital radius around 8.5-9 kpc. Furthermore, we investigate the environmental changes experienced by the Sun along these migration pathways, focusing on variations in radiation hazards and comet fluxes, which may have impacted planetary habitability. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of galactic habitability, emphasizing that the path a star takes within the Milky Way can significantly affect its surrounding environment and the potential for life. We propose a new concept of "Galactic habitable orbits," which accounts for evolving galactic structures and their effects on stellar and planetary systems. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the solar system's migration and its implications for habitability within the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>New HI views of the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic hydrogen (HI) is a vital player in the star-formation process in galaxies. It is the raw fuel for making molecules, an important shielding agent against interstellar radiation, and a buffer that soaks up the energy and momentum of stellar feedback. While for many years detailed studies of the HI thermal structure have been possible only in the Milky Way, the SKA pathfinders are expanding our view beyond the Solar neighborhood allowing for crucial tests of the HI heating and cooling processes under a wide range of physical conditions. This overview article highlights a few recent results and emphasizes areas where future observations can make large contributions. We show that the cold HI disk of the Milky Way is extended and flared, yet appears spatially coupled to the molecular gas. The cold neutral medium (CNM) in the Milky Way is colder and more abundant at higher optical extinctions due to more intense cooling and shielding. A comparison between the Milky Way, the Small Magellanic Cloud, the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC 6822 shows a good agreement with predictions from recent numerical simulations on how the CNM fraction depends on metalliciity. The fraction and spatial distribution of the thermally unstable HI remain as open questions and observationally have not been studied beyond the Milky Way. The excitation temperature of the warm neutral medium (WNM) is not well understood. Observations suggest higher WNM temperatures than what is seen in numerical simulations. The SKA, once operational, will take the HI studies into a new era of dense HI absorption grids for the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and the ability to study the HI thermal structure beyond the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Formation of transitional cE/UCD galaxies through massive disc to dwarf galaxy mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the merger of a dwarf disc galaxy with a massive spiral galaxy of the Milky Way type have been studied in detail. The remnant of such interaction after numerous crossings of the satellite through the disc of the main galaxy is a compact stellar core, the characteristics of which are close to small compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) or large ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs). Such transitional cE/UCD objects with an effective radius of 100-200 pc arise as a result of stripping the outer layers of the stellar core during the destruction of a disc dwarf galaxy. Numerical models of the satellite before interaction include baryonic matter (stars and gas) and dark mass. We use N-body to describe the dynamics of stars and dark matter and Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics to model the gas components of both galaxies. The direct method of calculating the gravitational force between all particles provides a qualitative resolution of spatial structures up to 10 pc. The simulated cE/UCD galaxies contain very little gas and dark matter at the end of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Galaxy mass dependence of metal-enrichment of nuclear star clusters</title>

Abstract: Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) are commonly found in galaxy centers, but their dominant formation mechanisms remain elusive. We perform a consistent analysis of stellar populations of 97 nearby NSCs, based on VLT spectroscopic data. The sample covers a galaxy stellar mass range of 10$^{7}$ to 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ and is more than 3$\times$ larger than any previous studies. We identify three galaxy stellar mass regimes with distinct NSC properties. In the low-mass regime of $\log M_{\rm host}$ $\lesssim$ 8.5, nearly all NSCs have metallicities lower than circum-NSC host but similar to typical red globular clusters (GCs), supporting the GC inspiral-merger scenario of NSC formation. In the high-mass regime of $\log M_{\rm host}$ $\gtrsim$ 9.5, nearly all NSCs have higher metallicities than circum-NSC host and red GCs, suggesting significant contributions from in-situ star formation (SF). In the intermediate-mass regime, a comparable fraction of NSCs have higher or lower metallicities than circum-NSC host and red GCs, with no clear dependence on NSC mass, suggesting intermittent in-situ SF. The majority of NSCs with higher metallicities than their host exhibit a negative age$-$metallicity correlation, providing clear evidence of long-term chemical enrichment. The average NSC$-$host metallicity difference peaks broadly around $\log M_{\rm host} \sim 9.8$ and declines towards both higher and lower galaxy mass. We find that the efficiency of dynamical friction-driven inspiral of GCs observed in present-day galaxies can explain the NSC mass at $\log M_{\rm host} \lesssim 9.5$ but falls short of observed ones at higher galaxy mass, reinforcing our conclusions based on stellar population analysis.</description>

      <title>Low-Frequency Turnover Star Forming Galaxies I: Radio Continuum Observations and Global Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broad-band radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) contains a wealth of complex physics. We aim to determine the physical emission and loss processes causing radio SED curvature and steepening to see which observed global astrophysical properties are correlated with radio SED complexity. We have acquired radio continuum data between 70 MHz and 17 GHz for a sample of 19 southern local (z &lt; 0.04) SFGs. Of this sample 11 are selected to contain low-frequency (&lt; 300 MHz) turnovers (LFTOs) in their SEDs and eight are control galaxies with similar global properties. We model the radio SEDs for our sample using a Bayesian framework whereby radio emission (synchrotron and free-free) and absorption or loss processes are included modularly. We find that without the inclusion of higher frequency data, single synchrotron power-law based models are always preferred for our sample; however, additional processes including free-free absorption (FFA) and synchrotron losses are often required to accurately model radio SED complexity in SFGs. The fitted synchrotron spectral indices range from -0.45 to -1.07 and are strongly anticorrelated with stellar mass suggesting that synchrotron losses are the dominant mechanism acting to steepen the spectral index in larger nearby SFGs. We find that LFTOs in the radio SED are independent from the inclination. The merging systems in our SFG sample have elevated specific star formation rates and flatter fitted spectral indices with unconstrained LFTOs. Lastly, we find no significant separation in global properties between SFGs with or without modelled LFTOs. Overall LFTOs are likely caused by a combination of FFA and ionisation losses in individual recent starburst regions with specific orientations and interstellar medium properties that, when averaged over the entire galaxy, do not correlate with global astrophysical properties.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Radio Emission from the Intermediate Mass Black Hole in POX 52: Deep Multi-Band Observations with ATCA and VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first multi-band centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to habor a robust intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A-configuration at S band (2--4 GHz) and C band (4--8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous non-detection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.</description>

      <title>The Outskirt Stellar Mass of Low-Redshift Massive Galaxies is an Excellent Halo Mass Proxy in Illustris/IllustrisTNG Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the extended stellar halos of low-redshift massive galaxies are tightly connected to the assembly of their dark matter halos. In this paper, we use the Illustris, IllustrisTNG100, and IllustrisTNG300 simulations to compare how different stellar aperture masses trace halo mass. For massive central galaxies ($M_\star\geq 10^{11.2}M_\odot$), we find that a 2D outskirt stellar mass measured between 50 to 100 kpc ($M_{\star,[50,100]}$) consistently outperforms other aperture-based stellar masses. We further show that $M_{\star,[50,100]}$ correlates better with halo mass than the total amount of accreted stars (the ex situ mass), which suggests that not all accreted stars connect to halo assembly equally. While the galaxy formation recipes are different between Illustris and IllustrisTNG100, the two simulations yield consistent ex situ outskirt fractions for massive galaxies (about 70% in $M_{\star,[50,100]}$). These results demonstrate the potential of using the outskirt stellar mass to deepen our understanding of galaxy-halo connection in massive dark matter halos and trace dark matter halos better.</description>

      <title>SpyDust: an improved and extended implementation for modeling spinning dust radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents 'SpyDust', an improved and extended implementation of the spinning dust emission model based on a Fokker-Planck treatment. 'SpyDust' serves not only as a Python successor to 'spdust', but also incorporates some corrections and extensions. Unlike 'spdust', which is focused on specific grain shapes, 'SpyDust' considers a wider range of grain shapes and provides the corresponding grain dynamics, directional radiation field and angular momentum transports. We recognise the unique effects of different grain shapes on emission, in particular the shape-dependent mapping between rotational frequency and spectral frequency.
  In addition, we update the expressions for effects of electrical dipole radiation back-reaction and plasma drag on angular momentum dissipation. We also discuss the degeneracies in describing the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of spinning dust grains with the interstellar environmental parameters. Using a typical Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) environment as an example, we perform a perturbative analysis of the model parameters, revealing strong positive or negative correlations between them. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows that four dominant modes can linearly capture most of the SED variations, highlighting the degeneracy in the parameter space of the SED shape in the vicinity of the chosen CNM environment. This opens the possibility for future applications of moment expansion methods to reduce the dimensionality of the encountered SED parameter space.</description>

      <title>A High Incidence of Central Star Formation Inferred from the Color Gradients of Galaxies at $z&gt;4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical color gradients of 669 galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;8$ by characterizing the wavelength dependence of their structural parameters derived from simultaneously fitting the seven-band NIRCam images acquired with the James Webb Space Telescope. Distinct from trends observed at lower redshifts, where most galaxies exhibit negative color gradients whereby galaxy centers are redder than their outskirts, in high-redshift galaxies positive color gradients match or even outnumber negative color gradients. The color gradients principally reflect radial variations in stellar population instead of dust reddening or contamination from active galactic nuclei. The sign and magnitude of the color profile depend systematically on the global properties of the galaxy: positive color gradients, characteristic of centrally concentrated star formation or outside-in growth, preferentially inhabit galaxies of lower stellar mass, smaller size, and bluer spectral energy distribution.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Formation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the presence of bright and well-formed galaxies at high redshifts, challenging the predictions of the standard Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological model. This paper explores the potential of Modified Gravity (MOG), specifically Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), to account for the rapid formation of these galaxies in the early universe. By enhancing the gravitational constant through a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$ and incorporating a massive vector field $\phi_\mu$, MOG predicts deeper gravitational wells that can accelerate the collapse of baryonic matter. We present theoretical insights demonstrating how MOG can facilitate the increase in star formation rate and early formation of galaxies, offering a compelling alternative to LCDM. Our findings suggest that MOG provides a viable framework for understanding the rapid growth of galaxies observed by JWST.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present the results of a theoretical study of the trajectories of massive particles in the K\"ottler metric in view of the cosmological constant {\Lambda}. For both negative and positive signs of {\Lambda} a classification of trajectories is proposed, with entries based on different solutions of the trajectory equation, obtained by the expansion of the corresponding algebraic curve in Puiseux series. We also provide some specific types of trajectories which correspond to different values of the cosmological constant. In the case of negative values of the cosmological constant its upper limit is estimated from the galaxy rotation curves</description>

      <title>The cosmic timeline implied by the highest redshift quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional picture of supermassive black-hole growth in the standard model had already been seriously challenged by the emergence of $\sim 10^9\;M_\odot$ quasars at $z\sim 7.5$, conflicting with the predicted formation of structure in the early $\Lambda$CDM Universe. But the most recent {\it JWST} discovery of a $\sim 10^8\;M_\odot$ source at $z\sim 10.1$ argues even more strongly against the possibility that these black holes were created in Pop II or III supernovae, followed by Eddington-limited accretion. Attempts at resolving this anomaly have largely focused on the formation of seeds via an exotic, direct collapse of primordial gas to an initial mass $\sim 10^5\;M_\odot$ -- a process that has never been seen anywhere in the cosmos. Our goal in this {\it Letter} is to demonstrate that the emergence of these black holes is instead fully consistent with standard astrophysics in the context of the alternative Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology known as the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe. We show that, while the predicted evolution in the standard model is overly compressed, the creation, growth and appearance of such high-$z$ quasars fall comfortably within the evolutionary history in this cosmology, thereby adding considerable observational support to the existing body of evidence favoring it over the standard scenario.</description>

Abstract: At the core of the Gaia mission is a multi-epoch survey consisting of astrometric, photometric, spectrophotometric, and spectroscopic measurements. The astrometric time series provides parallaxes and proper motions, along with information on astrometric binary systems. The photometric time series offers a means to investigate the variability of the sources. Due to their whole-sky, multi-epoch nature, multiple instruments, their magnitude range covering 21 magnitudes, and their remarkable photometric precision, these data allow us to describe the variability of celestial phenomena in an unprecedented manner. For the third Gaia Data Release (DR3), the data collection spanned 34 months, with a median number of field-of-view measurements in the G band of about 44, reaching up to 270. At publication time, DR3 delivered the largest collection of variable sources with an associated classification across the entire sky. All these sources have their $G$, $G_{BP}$, $G_{RP}$ epoch data published and accessible in the Gaia ESA archive. In summary, there are 10.5 million variable sources, including 9.5 million variable stars and 1 million QSOs. Additionally, 2.5 million galaxies were identified thanks to spurious variability caused by the non-axisymmetric nature of galaxies and the way Gaia collects data. Moreover, all the epoch data and time series of nearly 1.3 million sources in a pencil beam around the Andromeda galaxy are published, regardless of their status (constant or variable); This dataset is known as the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey. We also introduce the citizen science project, GaiaVari to classify variable stars, the Focused Product Release delivered on October 10, 2023. In the future, DR4 will cover 66 months, and we hope DR5 will have accumulated 10.5 years of data.</description>

      <title>Massive black holes or stars first: the key is the residual cosmic electron fraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z $\geq$ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions ($f_e$) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\rm \sim 10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}$. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with $\sim 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free</description>

      <title>The relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the filamentary cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Millennium Simulation to study the relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the cosmic web. We define the web as the unique, fully connected, percolating object with (unsmoothed) matter density everywhere exceeding 5.25 times the cosmic mean. This object contains 35\% of all cosmic mass but occupies only 0.62\% of all cosmic volume. It contains 26\% of dark matter haloes of mass $10^{11}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{12.7}M_\odot$, and to $&gt;90\%$ above $10^{14}M_\odot$. In contrast, it contains 45\% of all galaxies of stellar mass $10^{8.5}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$, to 60\% at $10^{11}M_\odot$ and to 90\% at $10^{11.5}M_\odot$. This difference arises because a large fraction of all satellite and backsplash galaxies are part of the cosmic web. Indeed, more than 50\% of web galaxies are satellites for stellar masses below that of the Milky Way, rising to about 70\% below $10^{10}M_\odot$, whereas centrals substantially outnumber satellites in the non-web population at all stellar masses. As a result, web galaxies have systematically lower specific star-formation rates (sSFR's) than non-web galaxies. For the latter, the distributions of stellar mass and sSFR are almost independent of web distance. Furthermore, for both central and satellite galaxies, the sSFR distributions at given stellar mass are identical in and outside the web, once differences in backsplash fraction are accounted for. For the galaxy formation model considered here, differences between web and non-web galaxy populations are almost entirely due to the difference in halo mass distribution between the two environments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian approach to equipartition estimation of magnetic field strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields, together with cosmic rays (CRs), play an important role in the dynamics and evolution of galaxies, but are difficult to estimate. Energy equipartition between magnetic fields and CRs provides a convenient way to approximate magnetic field strength from radio observations. We present a new approach for calculating the equipartition magnetic field strength based on Bayesian methods. In this approach, the magnetic field is a random variable that is distributed according to a posterior distribution conditional on synchrotron emission and the size of the emitting region. It allows the direct application of the general formulas for total and polarized synchrotron radiation without the need to invert these formulas, which has limited the equipartition method to highly simplified cases. We have derived the equipartition condition for the case of different low-energy breaks, slopes, and high-energy cutoffs of power law spectra of the CR proton and electron distributions. The derived formalism was applied in the general case of a magnetic field consisting of both uniform and randomly oriented field components. The applied Bayesian approach naturally provides the uncertainties in the estimated magnetic field strengths resulting from the uncertainties in the observables and the assumed values of the unknown physical parameters. In the examples presented, we used two different Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to generate the posterior distribution of the magnetic field. We have also developed a web application called BMAG that implements the described approach for different models and observational parameters of real sources.</description>

      <title>Testing the Universality of Self-Organized Criticality in Galactic, Extra-Galactic, and Black-Hole Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we are testing whether the power law slopes ($\alpha_F$, $\alpha_E$) of fluxes $(F)$, fluences or energies $(E)$ are universal in their size distributions, $N(F) \propto F^{-\alpha_F}$ and $N(E) \propto E^{-\alpha_E}$, in astrophysical observations of galactic, extragalactic, and black-hole systems. This is a test of fundamental importance for self-organized criticality (SOC) systems. The test decides whether (i) power laws are a natural consequence of the scale-freeness and inherent universality of SOC systems, or (ii) if they depend on more complex physical scaling laws. The former criterion allows quantitative predictions of the power law-like size distributions, while the later criterion requires individual physical modeling for each SOC variable and data set. Our statistical test, carried out with 61 published data sets, yields strong support for the former option, which implies that observed power laws can simply be derived from the scale-freeness and do not require specific physical models to understand their statistical distributions. The observations show a mean and standard deviation of $\alpha_F=1.78\pm0.29$ for SOC fluxes, and $\alpha_E=1.66\pm0.22$ for SOC fluences, and thus are consistent with the prediction of the fractal-diffusive SOC model, with $\alpha_F=1.80$ and $\alpha_E=1.67$.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks: The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical understanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study examines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to decrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and three velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic, parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare simulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic mass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low ($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show that the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal energy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating and lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more magnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced ion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron heating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the ion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic field, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Current Star Formation Rate and Nebula Contribution of Galaxies at z \textless\ 0.4 with FADO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star formation rate (SFR) is a crucial astrophysical tracer for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies, determining the interaction between interstellar medium properties and star formation, thereby inferring the evolutionary laws of cosmic star formation history and cosmic energy density. The mainstream approach to studying the stellar content in galaxies relies on pure stellar population synthesis models. However, these methods fail to account for the contamination of SFR caused by nebular gas radiation. Recent studies have indicated that neglecting nebular radiation contamination appears non-negligible in galaxies with intense star-forming activities and at relatively high redshifts, potentially leading to overestimating stellar masses. However, there is currently limited targeted research, particularly regarding galaxies at redshifts (z $&lt;$ 0.4). In this work, a total of 6511 star-formation galaxies (SFGs) are selected from the SDSS-DR18, and FADO fits their spectra. This tool can exclude nebular radiation contributions in the spectral fitting. A tentative work is carried out to explore the SFR of these galaxies. Our results show that the median value of $H_{\alpha}$ obtained by FADO fitting is $\sim$ 0.0146 dex higher than that obtained from the pure stellar population synthesis model {\it qsofitmore}. It has been demonstrated that the nebular emission shows a trend of increasing with redshift. We also studied the impact on the star-forming main sequence(SFMS) at low to intermediate redshifts. By comparing two spectral fitting software packages, we found that although the contribution of nebular emission is minimal, it generally shows an increasing trend with redshift. We anticipate that by combining optical and near-infrared spectral data, the influence of nebulae may become more prominent in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts (e.g., up to z $\sim$ 2).</description>

      <title>Observable and ionizing properties of star-forming galaxies with very massive stars and different IMFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of very massive stars (VMS, masses $&gt;100$ M$_{\odot}$) is now firmly established in the local group, nearby galaxies, and out to cosmological distances. If present, these stars could boost the UV luminosity and ionizing photon production of galaxies, helping thus to alleviate the overabundance of UV-bright galaxies found with the JWST at high-redshift. Combing consistent stellar evolution and atmosphere models tailored to VMS we compute spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a large set of models. We find that VMS contribute significantly to the UV luminosity and Lyman continuum of young stellar populations, and they are characterized by strong stellar HeII1640 emission, with EW(HeII) up to 4-8 Ang at young ages or $\sim 2.5-4$ Ang for constant SFR. For IMFs with a Salpeter slope, the boost of the UV luminosity is relatively modest. However, small changes in the IMF slope (e.g.~from $\alpha_2=-2.35$ to $-2$) lead to large increases in $L_{UV}$ and the ionizing photon production $Q$. Emission line strengths and the ionizing photon efficiency $\xi_{\rm ion}$ are also increased with VMS. Interestingly, SEDs including VMS show smaller Lyman breaks, and the shape of the ionizing spectra remain unaltered up to $\sim 35$ eV, but becomes softer at higher energies. We derive and discuss the maximum values quantities such as $L_{UV}$ per stellar mass or unit SFR, and $\xi_{\rm ion}$, $Q$ can reach when VMS are included, and we show that these values become essentially independent of the IMF. We propose observational methods to test for VMS and constrain the IMF. Finally, using JWST observations, we examine if high-redshift galaxies show some evidence of the presence of VMS and signs of non-standard IMFs. Very top-heavy IMFs can be excluded on average, but the IMF could well extend into the regime of VMS and be flatter than Salpeter in the bulk of high-$z$ galaxies. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Quasar Anomaly Detection (SQuAD) I: Rest-Frame UV Spectra from SDSS DR16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of applying anomaly detection algorithms to a quasar spectroscopic sub-sample from the SDSS DR16 Quasar Catalog, covering the redshift range 1.88 &lt; z &lt; 2.47. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed for dimensionality reduction of the quasar spectra, followed by hierarchical K-Means clustering in a 20-dimensional PCA eigenvector hyperspace. To prevent broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from being identified as the primary anomaly group, we conducted the analysis with and without them, comparing both datasets for a clearer identification of other anomalous quasar types. We identified 1,888 anomalous quasars, categorized into 10 broad groups. The anomalous groups include C IV Peakers-quasars with extremely strong and narrow C IV emission lines; Excess Si IV emitters-quasars where the Si IV line is as strong as the C IV line; and Si IV Deficient anomalies, which exhibit significantly weaker Si IV emission compared to typical quasars. The anomalous nature of these quasars is attributed to lower Eddington ratios for C IV Peakers, super-solar metallicity for Excess Si IV emitters, and sub-solar metallicity for Si IV Deficient anomalies. Additionally, we identified four groups of BAL anomalies: Blue BALs, Flat BALs, Reddened BALs, and FeLoBALs, distinguished primarily by the strength of reddening in these sources. Further, among the non-BAL quasars, we identified three types of reddened anomaly groups classified as heavily reddened, moderately reddened, and plateau-shaped spectrum quasars, each exhibiting varying degrees of reddening. The detected anomalies are presented as a value-added catalog.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of thermal dust polarization from aligned grains in the envelope of evolved stars with updated POLARIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are thought to influence the formation and evolution of circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars. Thermal dust polarization from aligned grains is a promising tool for probing magnetic fields and dust properties in these environments; however, a quantitative study on the dependence of thermal dust polarization on the physical properties of dust and magnetic fields for these circumstellar environments is still lacking. In this paper, we first perform the numerical modeling of thermal dust polarization in the IK Tau envelope using the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment mechanism implemented in our updated POLARIS code, accounting for the effect of grain drift relative to the gas. Despite experiencing grain drift and high gas density $n_{\rm gas} &gt; 10^6\,\rm cm^{-3}$, the minimum grain size required for efficient MRAT alignment of silicate grains is $\sim 0.007 - 0.05\,\rm\mu m$ due to strong stellar radiation fields. Ordinary paramagnetic grains can achieve perfect alignment by MRAT in the inner envelope of $r &lt; 500\,\rm au$ due to stronger magnetic fields of $B\sim10$ mG - 1G, producing the polarization degree of $\sim10\%$. The polarization degree can be enhanced to $\sim20-40\%$ for superparamagnetic grains with embedded iron inclusions. The magnetic field geometry affects the resulting polarization degree due to the projection effect. We investigate the effect of rotational disruption by RATs (RAT-D) and find that the RAT-D effect decreases the dust polarization degree due to the decrease in the maximum grain size. Our modeling results motivate further observational studies at far-infrared/sub-millimeter to constrain the properties of magnetic fields and dust in evolved star's envelopes.</description>

Abstract: We develop a Python tool to estimate the tail distribution of the number of dark matter halos beyond a mass threshold and in a given volume in a light-cone. The code is based on the extended Press-Schechter model and is computationally efficient, typically taking a few seconds on a personal laptop for a given set of cosmological parameters. The high efficiency of the code allows a quick estimation of the tension between cosmological models and the red candidate massive galaxies released by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as scanning the theory space with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. As an example application, we use the tool to study the cosmological implication of the candidate galaxies presented in Labb\'e et al. (2023). The standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well consistent with the data if the star formation efficiency can reach $\sim 0.3$ at high redshift. For a low star formation efficiency $\epsilon \sim 0.1$, $\Lambda$CDM model is disfavored at $\sim 2\sigma$-$3\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Mass Ratio Distribution of Hierarchical Triple Systems from the LAMOST-MRS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical triple-star systems consists of three components organised into an inner binary ($M_{1}$,$M_{2}$) and a more distant outer tertiary ($M_{3}$) star. The LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LAMOST-MRS) has offered a great sample for the study of triple system populations. We used the Peak Amplitude Ratio (PAR) method to obtain the mass ratio ($q_\mathrm{{in}}$, $q_\mathrm{{out}}$) of a triple system from its normalised spectrum. By calculating Cross-Correlation Function (CCF), we determined the correlation between the mass ratio $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ ($M_{3}$/($M_{1}$+$M_{2}$)) and the amplitude ratio ($A_{3}$/($A_{1}$+$A_{2}$)). We derived $q_\mathrm{{in}}$ of $0.5-1.0$ and $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ between 0.2 and 0.8. By fitting a power-law function of the corrected $q_\mathrm{{in}}$ distribution, the $\gamma_\mathrm{{in}}$ are estimated to be $-0.654\pm2.915$, $4.304\pm1.125$ and $11.371\pm1.309$ for A, F and G type stars. The derived $\gamma_\mathrm{{in}}$-values increase as the mass decrease, indicating that less massive stars are more likely to have companion stars with similar masses. By fitting a power-law function of the corrected $q_\mathrm{{out}}$ distribution, the ${\gamma_\mathrm{{out}}}$ are estimated to be $-2.016\pm0.172$, $-1.962\pm0.853$ and $-1.238\pm0.141$ for G, F and A type stars, respectively. The ${\gamma_\mathrm{{out}}}$-values show a trend of growth toward lower primary star masses.</description>

      <title>Source anisotropies and pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <title>Unveiling galaxy pair alignment in cosmic filaments: A 3D exploration using EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how galaxy pairs are oriented in three dimensions within cosmic filaments using data from the EAGLE simulation. We identify filament spines using DisPerSE and isolate galaxies residing in filamentary environments. Employing a FoF algorithm, we delineate individual filaments and determine their axes by diagonalizing the moment of inertia tensor. The orientations of galaxy pairs relative to the axis of their host filament are analyzed. Our study covers diverse subsets of filaments identified through varying linking lengths, examining how galaxy pairs align with the filament axis across different spatial parameters such as pair separation and distance from the filament spine. We observe a nearly uniform probability distribution for the cosine of the orientation angle, which is nearly identical in each case. We also investigate the effects of redshift space distortions and confirm that the probability distributions remain uniform in both real space and redshift space. To validate our approach, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations using various theoretical probability distributions. Our analysis does not reveal any evidence of preferential alignment of galaxy pairs within cosmic filaments in hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fate of the remnant in tidal stripping event: repeating and non-repeating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a $\gamma=5/3$ (or $\gamma=4/3$) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor $\beta \gtrsim 0.62$ (or $\gtrsim 1.1$) or loses energy vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>Inferring redshift and galaxy properties via a multi-task neural net with probabilistic outputs: An application to simulated MOONS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The era of large-scale astronomical surveys demands innovative approaches for rapid and accurate analysis of extensive spectral data, and a promising direction in which to address this challenge is offered by machine learning. Here, we introduce a new pipeline, M-TOPnet (Multi-Task network Outputting Probabilities), which employs a convolutional neural network with residual learning to simultaneously derive redshift and other key physical properties of galaxies from their spectra. Our tool efficiently encodes spectral information into a latent space, employing distinct downstream branches for each physical quantity, thereby benefiting from multi-task learning. Notably, our method handles the redshift output as a probability distribution, allowing for a more refined and robust estimation of this critical parameter. We demonstrate preliminary results using simulated data from the MOONS instrument, which will soon be operating at the ESO/VLT. We highlight the effectiveness of our tool in accurately predicting the redshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate of galaxies at z&gt;~1-3, even for faint sources (m_H ~ 24) for which traditional methods often struggle. Through analysis of the output probability distributions, we demonstrate that our pipeline enables robust quality screening of the results, achieving accuracy rates of up to 99% in redshift determination (defined as predictions within |Delta_z| &lt; 0.01 relative to the true redshift) with 8h exposure spectra, while automatically identifying potentially problematic cases. Our pipeline thus emerges as a powerful solution for the upcoming challenges in observational astronomy, combining precision, interpretability, and efficiency, all aspects that are crucial for analysing the massive datasets expected from next-generation instruments.</description>
