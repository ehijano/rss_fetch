      <title>Revisiting Extremal Couplings in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory of massive scalar fields on a fixed AdS$_{d+1}$ background with a cubic extremal interaction among them. A bulk coupling is called extremal whenever the corresponding conformal dimension of any of the dual CFT$_d$ operators matches the sum of all the others. For cubic bulk couplings, this is $\Delta_i+\Delta_j=\Delta_k$. These bulk interactions are often disregarded in the literature since they do not appear in traditional models of AdS/CFT. Turning them on yields a divergent vertex in the dual CFT, and here we show that these divergences can be regulated. Once renormalized, we demonstrate that this coupling introduces non-trivial mixing between single- and double-trace operators, and we compute the anomalous dimensions of the corrected operators to leading order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized conformal quantum mechanics as an ideal observer in two-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an action for a generalized conformal mechanics (GCM) coupled to Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity from a double scaling limit of the motion of a charged massive particle in the near-horizon geometry of a near-extremal spherical black hole. When JT gravity is treated in the classical approximation, the backreaction of the particle's wavefunction on the time-reparametrization mode (and therefore the bulk metric) vanishes while the conformal symmetry in GCM is reparametrized in a state-dependent way. We also construct the semi-classical Hilbert space of the full theory by explicitly solving the general time-dependent normalizable solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for GCM, and show that the time-reparametrization mode can be inferred from the measurement of suitable observables. Since the full theory of the GCM coupled to JT gravity is amenable to quantization, it can lead to a solvable model for a detector coupled to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Orthosymplectic Quotient Quiver Subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technique of orthosymplectic quotient quiver subtraction is introduced. This involves subtraction of an orthosymplectic quotient quiver from a $3d\;\mathcal N=4$ orthosymplectic quiver gauge theory which has the effect of gauging subgroups of the IR Coulomb branch global symmetry. Orthosymplectic quotient quivers for $\mathrm{SU}(2),\;\mathrm{SU}(3),\;G_2,$ and $\mathrm{SO}(7)$ are found and derived from Type IIA brane systems involving negatively charged branes for certain $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)$ gauge theories. Orthosymplectic quotient quiver subtraction is applied to magnetic quivers for nilpotent orbit closures providing new orthosymplectic counterparts to known unitary quivers. New Coulomb branch constructions are found such as for two height four nilpotent orbit closures of $F_4$ and one of height three. A novel application is to find magnetic quivers and Type IIA brane systems for the $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)$ worldvolume theory of two $\frac{1}{2}$M5 branes probing $E_6$ Klein singularity and for $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)\;(E_6,E_6)$ conformal matter. These give a perturbative Lagrangian realisation to the dynamics of strongly interacting M5 branes. The magnetic quiver for $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)\;(E_6,E_6)$ conformal matter is star-shaped and can also be interpreted as a magnetic quiver for a class $\mathcal S$ theory specified by $\mathrm{SO}(26)$ algebra on a three-punctured sphere.</description>

      <title>Islands in Bianchi type-I Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, CC, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Carroll Galileons in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first example of an interacting Carroll supersymmetric field theory with both temporal and spatial derivatives, belonging to the Galileon class, where the non-linear field equation remains second-order in derivative. To achieve this, we introduce two novel tools. First, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional Galilei/Carroll duality can be extended to higher dimensions, and includes the supersymmetry, by expressing the generators in a spinor basis. We then show that Carroll superalgebras are naturally connected to Euclidean, rather than Poincar\'e, superalgebras. Using the real multiplet of the three-dimensional N $=1$ Euclidean supersymmetry, we construct the scalar multiplet for N $=2$ Carroll supersymmetry and develop a tensor calculus to realize the aforementioned model. These results offer new insights into the structure of genuine higher-dimensional Carroll field theories and Carroll supersymmetry. While these tools are utilized to build a specific model, we anticipate that they possess broader applications in Carrollian physics.</description>

      <title>Varieties of four-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use algebraic geometry to study the anomaly-free representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra for 4-dimensional spacetime fermions. For irreducible representations, the problem reduces to studying the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{su}_n$ for $n\geq 3$. We show that there exist equivalence classes of such representations that are in bijection with the rational points on a projective variety that are dense in a region of the underlying real variety diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n-3}$. It follows that the chiral ones overwhelm the non-chiral ones for $n \geq 5$. We present an efficient algorithm to find explicit anomaly-free irreducible representations and discuss the generalization to reducible representations.</description>

      <title>Positive Geometries for Scattering Amplitudes in N=4 SYM and ABJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates geometric descriptions of scattering amplitudes, with a specific focus on scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM and ABJM theory. The recent development of the field of positive geometries provides us with a suitable framework for this endeavour. In particular, we will give a detailed account of the amplituhedron, the momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. Alongside these geometries, we will also discuss the ABHY associahedron, which encapsulates tree-level scattering amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory. We provide a detailed introduction to these positive geometries, which includes a comprehensive discussion of their structure. For the momentum amplituhedron, ABJM momentum amplituhedron, and ABHY associahedron we give a full stratification of their boundaries, which equivalently elucidates the singularity structure of the tree-level scattering amplitudes. Notably, we show that the ABJM momentum amplituhedron has an Euler characteristic equal to one. Furthermore, we explore the interconnections between these, and other, positive geometries. These connections are in part obtained via push forwards through the scattering equations. We develop techniques to calculate these push forwards which circumvents the necessity to solve the scattering equations explicitly. Beyond tree-level, we illustrate how positive geometries can be used to describe loop integrands in planar N=4 SYM and ABJM. A new framework is established to investigate these loop geometries in the space of dual momenta. The construction relies solely on lightcones and their intersections, and the framework simultaneously encompasses the loop level structure of the amplituhedron, momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. This further leads to compact general formulae for all one-loop integrands in N=4 SYM and ABJM.</description>

      <title>Normal Modes of the Small-Amplitude Oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a classical (1+1)-dimensional oscillon of small amplitude $\epsilon$. To all orders in $\epsilon$, the oscillon solution is exactly periodic. We study small perturbations of such periodic configurations. These perturbations are themselves periodic up to a monodromy matrix. We explicitly find the eigenvectors of the monodromy matrix, which are the analogues of normal modes for oscillons. Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu used such eigenvectors to quantize the sine-Gordon breather, and we suspect that they will be necessary to quantize the oscillon. Our results, regardless of the chosen model, suggest that low amplitude oscillons do not reflect small amplitude radiation.</description>

      <title>A pedagogical introduction to restricted Schur polynomials with applications to heavy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the study of microstates for 1/16-BPS black holes have inspired renewed interest in the analysis of heavy operators. For these operators, traditional techniques that work effectively in the planar limit are no longer applicable. Methods that are sensitive to finite N effects are required. In particular, trace relations that connect different multi-trace operators must be carefully considered. A powerful approach to tackling this challenge, which utilizes the representation theory of the symmetric group, is provided by restricted Schur polynomials. In this review, we develop these methods with the goal of providing the background needed for their application to 1/16-BPS black holes.</description>

      <title>Condensate decay in a radiation dominated cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\,\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\gamma(t)$ is always \emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization of free bosonic closed string theory and observe that the physicality of states requires vanishing of the worldsheet Virasoro algebra generators sandwiched between any two physical states. This requirement yields four classes of physical states, depending on discrete worldsheet symmetries: parity and time reversal. The usual string states which are highest weight states of the Virasoro algebra, preserve both, while the other new three classes break one or both. We apply our formulation to an accelerated worldsheet with horizons, initiating the worldsheet formulation of a thermal string theory and strings probing horizon of black holes.</description>

      <title>Looking at extremal black holes from very far away</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes are subject to large quantum effects, which modify their low-temperature thermodynamic behavior. Hitherto, these quantum effects were analyzed by separating the geometry into the near-horizon region and its exterior. It is desirable to understand and reproduce such corrections from the full higher-dimensional asymptotically flat or AdS geometry's perspective. We address this question in this article and fill this gap. Specifically, we find off-shell eigenmodes of the quadratic fluctuation operator of the Euclidean gravitational dynamics, with eigenvalues that vanish linearly with temperature. We illustrate this for BTZ and neutral black holes with hyperbolic horizons in AdS in Einstein-Hilbert theory, and for the charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory. The linear scaling with Matsubara frequency, which is a distinctive feature of the modes, together with the fact that their wavefunctions localize close to the horizon as we approach extremality, identifies them as responsible for the aforementioned quantum effects. We provide a contour prescription to deal with the sign indefiniteness of the Euclidean Einstein-Maxwell action, which we derive to aid our analysis. We also resolve a technical puzzle regarding modes associated with rotational isometries in stationary black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Implication of Jet Physics from MeV Line Emission of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12977v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic jets are believed to play an important role in producing prompt emission and afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the nature of the jet is poorly known owing to the lack of decisive features observed in the prompt emission. The discovery of an emission line evolving from about 37 to 6 MeV in the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe GRB jet physics. The time evolution of the central energy of the line with power-law index $-1$ is naturally explained by the high-latitude curvature effect. Under the assumption that the line emission is generated in the prompt emission by $e^\pm$ pair production, cooling, and annihilation in the jet, we can strictly constrain jet physics with observed line emission properties. We find that the radius of the emission region is $r\gtrsim10^{16}$ cm. The narrow line width of $\sim10\%$ requires that the line emission occurs within $\sim10\%$ of the dynamical time, which further implies short timescales of pair cooling to the nonrelativistic state and pair annihilation, as well as a slightly clumpy emission region. If the jet's Lorentz factor is $\Gamma\gtrsim400$, the fast cooling requirement needs an energy density of magnetic field in the jet much larger than that of prompt gamma rays, i.e., a magnetically dominated jet. The temporal behavior of line flux suggests some angle dependence of line emission. We also discuss the difficulties of other scenarios for the observed emission line.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Quantum Numbers in the $D_4$ Root System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce four fundamental quantum numbers based on the $D_4$ root system, giving a unified description of quarks and leptons. These numbers will make it possible to define electric charge in a simple way. By postulating a fundamental symmetry given by the binary tetrahedral group acting on this root system, we can easily prove conservation of electric charge. Also, possible electroweak interactions are given by a simple rule where the 24-cell acts on itself by quaternion multiplication. The three generations of fermions in the Standard Model are hereby identified with the three imaginary dimensions of the quaternions.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic modes remain unaffected by local field redefinition, the non-hydrodynamic modes are sensitive to it and can be eliminated through an appropriate all-order redefinition. This leads to a new hydro frame, where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We further show that the resulting stress tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode, illustrating its control over the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the SMEFT to dimension eight: Fermionic interactions I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third of a series of works (arxiv:2106.05291, arxiv:2205.03301) aimed at renormalizing the Standard Model effective field theory at one loop and to order $1/\Lambda^4$, with $\Lambda$ being the new physics cut-off. On this occasion, we concentrate on the running of two-fermion operators induced by pairs of dimension-six interactions. We work mostly off-shell, for which we obtain and provide a new and explicitly hermitian basis of dimension-eight Green's functions. All our results can be accessed in https://github.com/SMEFT-Dimension8-RGEs .</description>

      <title>Infrared Anomalous Dimensions at Three-Loop in the SM from Conserved Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the infrared structure of the Standard Model (SM) restricted to the first generation of fermions, including the full SM gauge group, up to three-loop order, and determine the resulting cusp and collinear anomalous dimensions for all gauge groups and particles of the theory. We observe that starting from three loops, the resulting cusp anomalous dimensions include terms involving two distinct couplings, contrary to previous claims in the literature. We give a detailed explanation of this observation and explore the origin of these terms. We provide a supplementary file where all infrared anomalous dimensions calculated in this work are collected. Our results are consistent with the existing literature wherever comparisons are possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spin of dark matter induces a gravitational analog of the electromagnetic Faraday effect, where the polarization of gravitational waves undergoes a rotation as they propagate through a dark matter halo with a non-vanishing axial spin tensor (hypermomentum). An expression for the gravitational rotation angle is provided, which is analogous to the Faraday rotation in optics, and evaluate its significance in astrophysical settings. Although the effect is expected to be small under current observational constraints, we discuss its potential importance in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also give an identification of the ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model, which proves that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic. This isomorphism also provides a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles that appear in the latter ring.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave projection of relativistic three-body amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the integral equations for partial-wave projected three-body scattering amplitudes, starting from the integral equations for three-body amplitudes developed for lattice QCD analyses. The results, which hold for generic three-body systems of spinless particles, build upon the recently derived partial-wave projected one-particle exchange, a primary component of the relativistic framework proven to satisfy S matrix unitarity. We derive simplified expressions for factorizable short-distance interactions, $\mathcal{K}_{3}$, in two equivalent formalisms - one symmetric under particle interchange and one asymmetric. For the asymmetric case, we offer parameterizations useful for amplitude analysis. Finally, we examine toy models for $3\pi$ systems at unphysically heavy pion masses with total isospins 0,1, and 2.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing black hole stability in cubic vector Galileon theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a subclass of generalized Proca theories where a cubic vector Galileon term breaks the $U(1)$ gauge invariance, it is known that there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nonvanishing temporal and longitudinal vector components. Such hairy BHs are present for a vanishing vector-field mass ($m=0$) with a non-zero cubic Galileon coupling $\beta_3$. We study the linear stability of those hairy BHs by considering even-parity perturbations in the eikonal limit. In the angular direction, we show that one of the three dynamical perturbations has a nontrivial squared propagation speed $c_{\Omega,1}^2$, while the other two dynamical modes are luminal. We could detect two different unstable behaviors of perturbations in all the parameter spaces of hairy asymptotically flat BH solutions we searched for. In the first case, an angular Laplacian instability on the horizon is induced by negative $c_{\Omega,1}^2$. For the second case, it is possible to avoid this horizon instability, but in such cases, the positivity of $c_{\Omega,1}^2$ is violated at large distances. Hence these hairy BHs are generally prone to Laplacian instabilities along the angular direction in some regions outside the horizon. Moreover, we also encounter a pathological behavior of the radial propagation speeds $c_r$ possessing two different values of $c_r^2$ for one of the dynamical perturbations. Introducing the vector-field mass $m$ to cubic vector Galileons, however, we show that the resulting no-hair Schwarzschild BH solution satisfies all the linear stability conditions in the small-scale limit, with luminal propagation speeds of three dynamical even-parity perturbations.</description>

      <title>Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</description>

      <title>Multiseed Krylov complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity is an attractive measure for the rate at which quantum operators spread in the space of all possible operators under dynamical evolution. One expects that its late-time plateau would distinguish between integrable and chaotic dynamics, but its ability to do so depends precariously on the choice of the initial seed. We propose to apply such considerations not to a single operator, but simultaneously to a collection of initial seeds in the manner of the block Lanczos algorithm. We furthermore suggest that this collection should comprise all simple (few-body) operators in the theory, which echoes the applications of Nielsen complexity to dynamical evolution. The resulting construction, unlike the conventional Krylov complexity, reliably distinguishes integrable and chaotic Hamiltonians without any need for fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based architectures have recently proved to be an efficient tool for numerical simulations of Effective String Theories regularized on the lattice that otherwise cannot be efficiently sampled by standard Monte Carlo methods. In this work we use Stochastic Normalizing Flows, a state-of-the-art deep-learning architecture based on non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations, to study different effective string models. After testing the reliability of this approach through a comparison with exact results for the Nambu-Got\={o} model, we discuss results on observables that are challenging to study analytically, such as the width of the string and the shape of the flux density. Furthermore, we perform a novel numerical study of Effective String Theories with terms beyond the Nambu-Got\={o} action, including a broader discussion on their significance for lattice gauge theories. These results establish the reliability and feasibility of flow-based samplers for Effective String Theories and pave the way for future applications on more complex models.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple toy model of cosmic acceleration driven purely by a self-interacting scalar field embedded in theory of grand unification. The scalar self-interaction is Higgs-like and provokes a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The coefficient of the quadratic term in the self-interaction potential has an evolution and it leads to a cosmic variation of proton-to-electron mass ratio, $\mu$. We perform a cosmological reconstruction from the kinematic parameter jerk and discuss a few cosmological consequences of the theory. We also compare the theoretically calculated $\mu$ variation with the observations of molecular absorption spectra from Cesium Atomic Clock data.</description>

      <title>Removing spurious degrees of freedom from EFT of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the effective field theory approach to gravity, the Lagrangian density for general relativity is supplemented by generally covariant terms of higher order in the Riemann tensor and its derivatives. At face value, these terms will result in higher derivative equations of motion and additional degrees of freedom beyond those of general relativity. This is seemingly at odds with the goal of effective field theory which is to encode ultraviolet corrections in terms of existing low energy degrees of freedom. Here we apply an action-based procedure for the removal of spurious degrees of freedom for the case of general relativity supplemented by a term cubic in the Riemann tensor. To the order we work in, the resulting reduced theory takes the form of minimally modified gravity, which is a class of modified gravity theories that propagate just the massless spin-2 graviton, but exhibit a preferred frame at short distances due to a deformation of time diffeomorphisms. Our work suggests that this class of theories can be understood as an effective theory of gravity, capturing effects of unknown ultraviolet physics.</description>

      <title>Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? In this work we study a low-mass-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles can form mirror atoms and hadrons and all these stable particles can comprise a large part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. Such a phase transition can generate stochastic gravitational waves that can be detected by the future gravitational wave experiments. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the SKA. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula. We assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect which indicates that hydrogen is always in correlation with dark matter, and hydrogen gas is strongly present in the guitar nebula.</description>

      <title>Non-singular cosmological scenarios in scalar-tensor theories and their stability: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article gives a concise overview of the development and current status of studies on healthy models of the early Universe without an initial singularity, namely the cosmological bounce and Genesis scenarios, constructed within a broad class of scalar-tensor theories, specifically Horndeski theories and their generalizations. The review focuses on the topics related to linear stability at the perturbation level over the non-singular background solutions: 1) the no-go theorem, valid for non-singular cosmologies within Horndeski theory, 2) the updates on possible approaches to evade the no-go theorem, 3) the role of disformal transformations relating the Horndeski subclasses with the generalized theories like DHOST, 4) the effects on stability caused by additional matter coupling and potential emergence of superluminal perturbation modes in the multi-component setting.</description>

      <title>General vacuum stability of orbifold gauge breaking and application to asymptotic grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the vacuum stability of gauge symmetry breaking in five dimensions, compactified on the $S_1/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}'_2)$ orbifold. We consider $SU(N)$, $Sp(N)$, $SO(2N)$ and $SO(2N+1)$ theories in the bulk, and provide an exhaustive classification of possible parity assignments that lead to stable orbifolds and of the corresponding symmetry breaking patterns. We use these results in the search for viable asymptotic grand unification theories (aGUT), testing the stability criteria on models based on $SU(6)$ and $SU(8)$. As a result, we identify two viable aGUTs: a unique $SU(6)$ pathway down to the Standard Model, and one $SU(8)$ model leading to an intermediate Pati-Salam partial unification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic formalism of inflation allows us to describe the scalar-field dynamics in a non-perturbative way. The correspondence between the diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations makes it possible to exhaustively construct analytical solutions in stochastic inflation. Those exact statistical quantities such as distribution and correlation functions have one-to-one correspondence to the exactly solvable solutions in non-relativistic quantum mechanics in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. A class of such solutions is presented by means of isospectral Hamiltonians with an underlying symmetry called shape invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Levy-Leblond equation (GLL) is used to study the bound state problem for a non-relativistic Fermi field in external potentials. A condition when the rest energy term can be removed from the GLL equation is determined. For external potentials which do not obey the condition, the bound state spectrum is affected non-trivially by the rest energy of the Fermi field. This is demonstrated for a spherical well type potential of finite depth. The existence of bound states in the well, their number and energies all depend on the value of the rest energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show generically that the dynamics of a probe particle near the event horizon of a non-extreme black hole is described by the tachyon effective action. The Hagedorn temperature in the action is always equal to the Hawking temperature of the background black hole. The fact suggests that the infalling particle should decay completely into gravitons or closed strings approaching the event horizon. The increased area in the black hole due to absorption of a particle should be interpreted as the entropy of degenerate states of the closed strings that the particle decays into. With the energy match condition between the infalling particle and the emitted closed strings on the event horizon, we examine this variational area-entropy relation and find that it matches in all cases if the closed string emission process from an unstable D0-brane obeys the first law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that unitarity cuts and the duality between color and kinematics are sufficient constraints to bootstrap $D$-dimensional QCD scattering amplitudes starting from three-particle tree-level. Specifically, we calculate tree level amplitudes through six-points, as well as the four-point one-loop correction for massive fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group -- constructing a color-dual representation of the latter for the first time. To do so we clarify a prescription for functional kinematic ansatze involving fermionic matter. The advantages of color-dual calculation, familiar from particles in the adjoint, also apply here: only a small number of basis topologies must be constrained via physical information of the theory, and algebraic relations propagate this to a full solution. As all the QCD amplitudes we construct here are color-dual, they trivially generate $D$-dimensional amplitudes in gravitational theories via double-copy construction.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the one-loop quantum entanglement entropy in ten-dimensional Type-II string theory using the orbifold method by analytically continuing in $N$ the genus-one partition function for string orbifolds on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$ conical spaces known for all odd integers $N &gt; 1$. We show that the tachyonic contributions to the orbifold partition function can be appropriately summed and analytically continued to an expression that is finite in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ resulting in a finite and calculable answer for the entanglement entropy. We discuss the implications of the finiteness of the entanglement entropy for the information paradox, quantum gravity, and holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological polytope and bootstrap programs have revealed interesting connections between positive geometries, modern on-shell methods and bootstrap principles studied in the amplitudes community with the wavefunction of the Universe in toy models of FRW cosmologies. To compute these FRW correlators, one often faces integrals that are too difficult to evaluate by direct integration. Borrowing from the Feynman integral community, the method of (canonical) differential equations provides an efficient alternative for evaluating these integrals. Moreover, we further develop our geometric understanding of these integrals by describing the associated \emph{relative} twisted cohomology. Leveraging recent progress in our understanding of relative twisted cohomology in the Feynman integral community, we give an algorithm to predict the basis size and simplify the computation of the differential equations satisfied by FRW correlators.</description>

Abstract: We consider $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of Type-II compactifications to four and six dimensions on several Calabi-Yau manifolds in the orbifold limit with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy. The spectrum can contain tachyons in the doubly-twisted sectors which can lead to new infrared divergences for the partition function that are not present in the orbifolds of the uncompactified ten-dimensional theory. We show that all tachyonic contributions in these models admit a resummation and analytic continuation that yields finite entropy in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ just as in ten dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We compute the exact one-loop partition function of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of Euclidean BTZ black hole with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy of the black hole horizon in string theory as a function of the mass and spin of the black hole and the $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ radius. We analyze the tachyonic contribution to the modular integrand for the partition function known for odd integers $N&gt;1$ and show that it admits an analytic continuation resulting in a finite answer for the modular integral in the physical region $0&lt; N \leq 1$. We discuss the flat space limit and the relevance of this computation for quantum gravity near black hole horizons and holography in relation to the thermal entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry resolution of entanglement for categorical non-invertible symmetries (CaT-SREE) in (1 + 1)-dimensional CFTs. The definition parallels that of group-like invertible symmetries, employing the concept of symmetric boundary states with respect to a categorical symmetry. Our examination extends to rational CFTs, where the behavior of CaT-SREE mirrors that of group-like invertible symmetries. We find that CaT-SREE can be defined if there is no obstruction to gauging the categorical symmetry, as happens in the case of group-like symmetries. We also provide instances of the breakdown of entanglement equipartition at the next-to-leading order in the cutoff expansion. Our findings shed light on how the interplay between conformal boundary conditions and categorical symmetries lead to specific patterns in the entanglement entropy.</description>

Abstract: We consider a quantum scalar field in a classical (Euclidean) De Sitter background, whose radius is fixed dynamically by Einstein's equations. In the case of a free scalar, it has been shown by Becker and Reuter that if one regulates the quantum effective action by putting a cutoff $N$ on the modes of the quantum field, the radius is driven dynamically to infinity when $N$ tends to infinity. We show that this result holds also in the case of a self-interacting scalar, both in the symmetric and broken-symmetry phase. Furthermore, when the gravitational background is put on shell, the quantum corrections to the mass and quartic self-coupling are found to be finite.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we revisit and elaborate on twisted holography for AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times X$ with $X= T^4$, K3, with a particular focus on K3. We describe the twist of supergravity, identify the corresponding (generalization of) BCOV theory, and enumerate twisted supergravity states. We use this knowledge, and the technique of Koszul duality, to obtain the $N \rightarrow \infty$, or planar, limit of the chiral algebra of the dual CFT. The resulting symmetries are strong enough to fix planar 2 and 3-point functions in the twisted theory or, equivalently, in a 1/4-BPS subsector of the original duality. This technique can in principle be used to compute corrections to the chiral algebra perturbatively in $1/N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnetohydrodynamics using holography. The gravity model is closely related to the STU supergravity in five dimensions and admits an analytical black brane solution carrying the conserved charge dual to the magnetic 1-form symmetry of the magnetohydrodynamic system. The black brane solution features a fortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing the magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge fields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric part of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV cut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the proportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite the zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.</description>

Abstract: We study chiral condensate in cold nuclear matter on the basis of holographic theory, which would be dual to a baryon system in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the confinement phase. Our model is a holographic model based on the D$3$/D$7$ branes. The magnitude of the chiral condensate obtained in our model is found to gradually increase with increasing baryon density $n$ within the range of the dilute nucleon gas, $n&lt;1$, where our model is available. This is a result for the chiral condensate in the holographic model as a function of $n$, which can be compared to the chiral perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a coupled system consisting of a complex scalar field, a U(1) gauge field, a complex Higgs scalar field, and Einstein gravity. We present nontopological soliton star solutions in which the interior geometry is described by the de Sitter metric, the exterior by the Schwarzschild metric, and these two regions are attached by a spherical surface layer with a finite thickness. This structure is the same as the so-called gravastars, so we refer to these solutions as \lq solitonic gravastars\rq . We demonstrate that compact solitonic gravastars that possessing photon spheres can appear. Additionally, we study the mass and compactness of solitonic gravastars for various sets of parameters that characterize the system.</description>

Abstract: String scattering amplitudes in the high energy asymptotic region have been studied by saddle point approximation. Recently, it was pointed out that infinitely many complex saddles contribute to string amplitudes even at tree-level after redefining the original formal integration contour so that the new contour analytically continues amplitudes appropriately. It is a challenging problem to identify which saddles contribute to higher genus corrections of string amplitudes. In this paper, we construct QFT toy models which have the same infinite mass tower as string amplitudes but ignoring degeneracies. Their higher loop Feynman diagrams are evaluated by identifying their contributing complex saddles. We find that the saddles associated with infinitely many stringy excitations provide highly oscillatory terms to the amplitudes. We conjecture that string amplitudes, as functions of momenta, approach multi-fractal functions in the high energy asymptotic regions if higher genus contributions are fully included. Their fractal dimensions should be determined purely by the type of string theory and the spacetime dimension where string scatterings occur.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>

      <title>Rotation of the CMB polarisation by foreground lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.12573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the weak lensing corrections to the CMB polarization anisotropies. We concentrate on the effect of rotation and show that the rotation of polarisation is a true physical effect which has to be taken into account at second order in perturbation theory. We clarify inconsistencies on the treatment of this rotation in the recent literature. We also show that at first order in perturbation theory there is no rotation of polarisation also for vector and tensor modes.</description>

      <title>The deformed Inozemtsev spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13066v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Inozemtsev chain is an exactly solvable interpolation between the short-range Heisenberg and long-range Haldane-Shastry (HS) chains. In order to unlock its potential to study spin interactions with tunable interaction range using the powerful tools of integrability, the model's mathematical properties require better understanding. As a major step in this direction, we present a new generalisation of the Inozemtsev chain with spin symmetry reduced to U(1), interpolating between a Heisenberg xxz chain and the xxz-type HS chain, and integrable throughout. Underlying it is a new quantum many-body system that extends the elliptic Ruijsenaars system by including spins, contains the trigonometric spin-Ruijsenaars-Macdonald system as a special case, and yields our spin chain by 'freezing'. Our models have potential applications from condensed-matter to high-energy theory, and provide a crucial step towards a general theory for long-range integrability.</description>

      <title>Bethe ansatz inside Calogero-Sutherland models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura and Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Spectral Method: From Atomic Orbitals to Classical Self-Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the Quantum Spectral Method to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

      <title>Efficient and precise quantum simulation of ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and precise framework to quantum simulate the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering. This framework employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements a compact scheme for encoding this basis upon lattice discretization. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. Our framework simulates the scattering by the efficient and precise algorithm of the truncated Taylor series. The qubit cost of our framework scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our framework advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our framework with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found. Our framework can be generalized to simulate the dynamics of various scattering problems in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Light QCD Axion with Hilltop Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a light QCD axion and identify the parameter space to obtain the correct relic dark matter abundance. The axion potential is flattened at the origin, corresponding to the only minimum, while it is unsuppressed at $\pi$. These potential features arise by assuming a mirror sector with the strong CP phase $\bar\theta$ shifted by $\pi$ compared to the SM sector, which allows the mirror axion potential to be tuned against the usual QCD axion potential. Before the QCD phase transition, assuming the mirror sector is decoupled and much colder than the SM thermal bath, the mirror sector potential dominates, causing the axion to initially roll to a temporary minimum at $\pi$. However, after the QCD phase transition, the potential minimum changes, and the axion relaxes from the newly created "hilltop" near $\pi$ to the CP-conserving minimum at the origin. As the axion adiabatically tracks this shift in the potential minimum through the QCD phase transition, with non-adiabatic evolution near $\pi$ and 0, it alters the usual prediction of the dark matter abundance. Consequently, this "hilltop" misalignment mechanism opens new regions of axion parameter space, with the correct relic abundance while still solving the strong CP problem, that could be explored in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for \(SU(N)\) Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, making possible IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Future targets for light gauge bosons from cosmic strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings, theoretical one-dimensional topological defects from the early universe, provide a valuable opportunity for exploring dark matter (DM) production and gravitational wave (GW) emission. Our study investigates the production of gauge bosons and GW emission from cosmic string decay, considering the constraints imposed by cosmological observations. We specifically examine how gauge bosons radiated from strings contribute to DM and dark radiation, with limits set by the observed DM abundance and cosmic microwave background data, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave spectrum of this model across both low and high frequencies. Notably, the spectrum typically follows a $f^{-1/3}$ pattern at high frequencies, beyond the pivot frequency $f_*$. We derive an analytical expression for the frequency $f_*$ and confirm its accuracy through numerical verification. Furthermore, we compare the GW spectrum of this model with the forecasted capabilities of future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the Big Bang Observer, and $\mu$Ares. Finally, we discuss how these considerations impact the model parameters, specifically the gauge boson mass and the energy scale of U(1) symmetry breaking, providing insights into how cosmic strings could enhance our understanding of DM and GW astronomy.</description>
