      <title>An Efficient Finite Element Solver for a Nonuniform size-modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck Ion Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient finite element iterative method for solving a nonuniform size-modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck ion channel (SMPNPIC) model, along with a SMPNPIC program package that works for an ion channel protein with a three-dimensional crystallographic structure and an ionic solvent with multiple ionic species. In particular, the SMPNPIC model is constructed and then reformulated by novel mathematical techniques so that each iteration of the method only involves linear boundary value problems and nonlinear algebraic systems, circumventing the numerical difficulties caused by the strong nonlinearities, strong asymmetries, and strong differential equation coupling of the SMPNPIC model. To further improve the method's efficiency, an efficient modified Newton iterative method is adapted to the numerical solution of each related nonlinear algebraic system. Numerical results for a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and a mixture solution of four ionic species demonstrate the method's convergence, the package's high performance, and the importance of considering nonuniform ion size effects. They also partially validate the SMPNPIC model by the anion selectivity property of VDAC.</description>

      <title>SUNDIALS Time Integrators for Exascale Applications with Many Independent ODE Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex systems can be accurately modeled as a set of coupled time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). However, solving such equations can be prohibitively expensive, easily taxing the world's largest supercomputers. One pragmatic strategy for attacking such problems is to split the PDEs into components that can more easily be solved in isolation. This operator splitting approach is used ubiquitously across scientific domains, and in many cases leads to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that need to be solved as part of a larger "outer-loop" time-stepping approach. The SUNDIALS library provides a plethora of robust time integration algorithms for solving ODEs, and the U.S. Department of Energy Exascale Computing Project (ECP) has supported its extension to applications on exascale-capable computing hardware. In this paper, we highlight some SUNDIALS capabilities and its deployment in combustion and cosmology application codes (Pele and Nyx, respectively) where operator splitting gives rise to numerous, small ODE systems that must be solved concurrently.</description>

      <title>Schwarz Methods for Nonlocal Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first domain decomposition methods for partial differential equations were already developed in 1870 by H. A. Schwarz. Here we consider a nonlocal Dirichlet problem with variable coefficients, where a nonlocal diffusion operator is used. We find that domain decomposition methods like the so-called Schwarz methods seem to be a natural way to solve these nonlocal problems. In this work we show the convergence for nonlocal problems, where specific symmetric kernels are employed, and present the implementation of the multiplicative and additive Schwarz algorithms in the above mentioned nonlocal setting.</description>

      <title>Novel Local Characteristic Decomposition Based Path-Conservative Central-Upwind Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce local characteristic decomposition based path-conservative central-upwind schemes for (nonconservative) hyperbolic systems of balance laws. The proposed schemes are made to be well-balanced via a flux globalization approach, in which source terms are incorporated into the fluxes: This helps to enforce the well-balanced property when the resulting quasi-conservative system is solved using the local characteristic decomposition based central-upwind scheme recently introduced in [{\sc A. Chertock, S. Chu, M. Herty, A. Kurganov, and M. Luk\'{a}\v{c}ov\'{a}-Medvi{\softd}ov\'{a}}, J. Comput. Phys., 473 (2023), Paper No. 111718]. Nonconservative product terms are also incorporated into the global fluxes using a path-conservative technique. We illustrate the performance of the developed schemes by applying them to one- and two-dimensional compressible multifluid systems and thermal rotating shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Conservative semi-lagrangian finite difference scheme for transport simulations using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Lagrangian (SL) schemes are highly efficient for simulating transport equations and are widely used across various applications. Despite their success, designing genuinely multi-dimensional and conservative SL schemes remains a significant challenge. Building on our previous work [Chen et al., J. Comput. Phys., V490 112329, (2023)], we introduce a conservative machine-learning-based SL finite difference (FD) method that allows for extra-large time step evolution. At the core of our approach is a novel dynamical graph neural network designed to handle the complexities associated with tracking accurately upstream points along characteristics. This proposed neural transport solver learns the conservative SL FD discretization directly from data, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes, while significantly simplifying algorithm implementation. We validate the method' s effectiveness and efficiency through numerical tests on benchmark transport equations in both one and two dimensions, as well as the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Iterative Reconstruction Methods for Cosmological X-Ray Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the imaging of cosmic strings by using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Mathematically, we study the inversion of an X-ray transform in Lorentzian geometry, called the light ray transform. The inverse problem is highly ill-posed, with additional complexities of being large-scale and dynamic, with unknown parameters that represent multidimensional objects. This presents significant computational challenges for the numerical reconstruction of images that have high spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we begin with a microlocal stability analysis for inverting the light ray transform using the Landweber iteration. Next, we discretize the spatiotemporal object and light ray transform and consider iterative computational methods for solving the resulting inverse problem. We provide a numerical investigation and comparison of some advanced iterative methods for regularization including Tikhonov and sparsity-promoting regularizers for various example scalar functions with conormal type singularities.</description>

      <title>Numerical validation of an adaptive model for the determination of nonlinear-flow regions in highly heterogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptive model for the description of flows in highly heterogeneous porous media is developed in~\cite{FP21,FP23}. There, depending on the magnitude of the fluid's velocity, the constitutive law linking velocity and pressure gradient is selected between two possible options, one better adapted to slow motion and the other to fast motion. We propose here to validate further this adaptive approach by means of more extensive numerical experiments, including a three-dimensional case, as well as to use such approach to determine a partition of the domain into slow- and fast-flow regions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for the efficient implementation of self-adjusting multi-rate Runge-Kutta methods and we extend the previously available stability analyses of these methods to the case of an arbitrary number of sub-steps for the active components. We propose a physically motivated model problem that can be used to assess the stability of different multi-rate versions of standard Runge-Kutta methods and the impact of different interpolation methods for the latent variables. Finally, we present the results of several numerical experiments, performed with implementations of the proposed methods in the framework of the \textit{OpenModelica} open-source modelling and simulation software, which demonstrate the efficiency gains deriving from the use of the proposed multi-rate approach for physical modelling problems with multiple time scales.</description>

      <title>Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving the two-fluid plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-fluid plasma model has a wide range of timescales which must all be numerically resolved regardless of the timescale on which plasma dynamics occurs. The answer to solving numerically stiff systems is generally to utilize unconditionally stable implicit time advance methods. Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods have emerged as a powerful tool for solving stiff partial differential equations. The HDG framework combines the advantages of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, such as high-order accuracy and flexibility in handling mixed hyperbolic/parabolic PDEs with the advantage of classical continuous finite element methods for constructing small numerically stable global systems which can be solved implicitly. In this research we quantify the numerical stability conditions for the two-fluid equations and demonstrate how HDG can be used to avoid the strict stability requirements while maintaining high order accurate results.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Finite Volume Scheme for Compactly Heterogeneous Scalar Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a finite volume scheme for the scalar conservation law $\partial_t u + \partial_x (H(x, u)) = 0$ with bounded initial condition for a wide class of flux function $H$, convex with respect to the second variable. The main idea for the construction of the scheme is to use the theory of discontinuous flux. We prove that the resulting approximating sequence converges boundedly almost everywhere on $\mathopen]0, +\infty\mathclose[$ to the entropy solution.</description>

      <title>Discretization Error of Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning is a variant of machine learning that is designed to approximate maps between function spaces from data. The Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is a common model architecture used for operator learning. The FNO combines pointwise linear and nonlinear operations in physical space with pointwise linear operations in Fourier space, leading to a parameterized map acting between function spaces. Although FNOs formally involve convolutions of functions on a continuum, in practice the computations are performed on a discretized grid, allowing efficient implementation via the FFT. In this paper, the aliasing error that results from such a discretization is quantified and algebraic rates of convergence in terms of the grid resolution are obtained as a function of the regularity of the input. Numerical experiments that validate the theory and describe model stability are performed.</description>

      <title>A second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential scheme with application to the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study and extend a class of semi-Lagrangian exponential methods, which combine exponential time integration techniques, suitable for integrating stiff linear terms, with a semi-Lagrangian treatment of nonlinear advection terms. Partial differential equations involving both processes arise for instance in atmospheric circulation models. Through a truncation error analysis, we first show that previously formulated semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes are limited to first-order accuracy due to the discretization of the linear term; we then formulate a new discretization leading to a second-order accurate method. Also, a detailed stability study, both considering a linear stability analysis and an empirical simulation-based one, is conducted to compare several Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes, as well as a well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method, which is used in operational atmospheric models. Numerical simulations of the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere, considering standard and challenging benchmark test cases, are performed to assess the orders of convergence, stability properties, and computational cost of each method. The proposed second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential method was shown to be more stable and accurate than the previously formulated schemes of the same class at the expense of larger wall-clock times; however, the method is more stable and has a similar cost compared to the well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit; therefore, it is a competitive candidate for potential operational applications in atmospheric circulation modeling.</description>

      <title>On Smale's 17th problem over the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently solving a system of $n$ non-linear equations in ${\mathbb R}^d$. Addressing Smale's 17th problem stated in 1998, we consider a setting whereby the $n$ equations are random homogeneous polynomials of arbitrary degrees. In the complex case and for $n= d-1$, Beltr\'{a}n and Pardo proved the existence of an efficient randomized algorithm and Lairez recently showed it can be de-randomized to produce a deterministic efficient algorithm. Here we consider the real setting, to which previously developed methods do not apply. We describe an algorithm that efficiently finds solutions (with high probability) for $n= d -O(\sqrt{d\log d})$. If the maximal degree is very large, we also give an algorithm that works up to $n=d-1$.</description>

      <title>Efficient spline orthogonal basis for representation of density functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probability density functions form a specific class of functional data objects with intrinsic properties of scale invariance and relative scale characterized by the unit integral constraint. The Bayes spaces methodology respects their specific nature, and the centred log-ratio transformation enables processing such functional data in the standard Lebesgue space of square-integrable functions. As the data representing densities are frequently observed in their discrete form, the focus has been on their spline representation. Therefore, the crucial step in the approximation is to construct a proper spline basis reflecting their specific properties. Since the centred log-ratio transformation forms a subspace of functions with a zero integral constraint, the standard $B$-spline basis is no longer suitable. Recently, a new spline basis incorporating this zero integral property, called $Z\!B$-splines, was developed. However, this basis does not possess the orthogonal property which is beneficial from computational and application point of view. As a result of this paper, we describe an efficient method for constructing an orthogonal $Z\!B$-splines basis, called $Z\!B$-splinets. The advantages of the $Z\!B$-splinet approach are foremost a computational efficiency and locality of basis supports that is desirable for data interpretability, e.g. in the context of functional principal component analysis. The proposed approach is demonstrated on an empirical demographic dataset.</description>

      <title>The injectivity radius of the compact Stiefel manifold under the Euclidean metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The injectivity radius of a manifold is an important quantity, both from a theoretical point of view and in terms of numerical applications. It is the largest possible radius within which all geodesics are unique and length-minimizing. In consequence, it is the largest possible radius within which calculations in Riemannian normal coordinates are well-defined. A matrix manifold that arises frequently in a wide range of practical applications is the compact Stiefel manifold of orthogonal $p$-frames in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We observe that geodesics on this manifold are space curves of constant Frenet curvatures. Using this fact, we prove that the injectivity radius on the Stiefel manifold under the Euclidean metric is $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Space-Time FEM for the Vectorial Wave Equation under Consideration of Ohm's Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to deal with complex geometries and to go to higher orders is the main advantage of space-time finite element methods. Therefore, we want to develop a solid background from which we can construct appropriate space-time methods. In this paper, we will treat time as another space direction, which is the main idea of space-time methods. First, we will briefly discuss how exactly the vectorial wave equation is derived from Maxwell's equations in a space-time structure, taking into account Ohm's law. Then we will derive a space-time variational formulation for the vectorial wave equation using different trial and test spaces. This paper has two main goals. First, we prove unique solvability for the resulting Galerkin--Petrov variational formulation. Second, we analyze the discrete equivalent of the equation in a tensor product and show conditional stability, i.e. a CFL condition. Understanding the vectorial wave equation and the corresponding space-time finite element methods is crucial for improving the existing theory of Maxwell's equations and paves the way to computations of more complicated electromagnetic problems.</description>

      <title>Coupled Boundary and Volume Integral Equations for Electromagnetic Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study frequency domain electromagnetic scattering at a bounded, penetrable, and inhomogeneous obstacle $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3 $. From the Stratton-Chu integral representation, we derive a new representation formula when constant reference coefficients are given for the interior domain. The resulting integral representation contains the usual layer potentials, but also volume potentials on $\Omega$. Then it is possible to follow a single-trace approach to obtain boundary integral equations perturbed by traces of compact volume integral operators with weakly singular kernels. The coupled boundary and volume integral equations are discretized with a Galerkin approach with usual Curl-conforming and Div-conforming finite elements on the boundary and in the volume. Compression techniques and special quadrature rules for singular integrands are required for an efficient and accurate method. Numerical experiments provide evidence that our new formulation enjoys promising properties.</description>

Abstract: We consider a nonlinear problem $F(\lambda,u)=0$ on infinite-dimensional Banach spaces that correspond to the steady-state bifurcation case. In the literature, it is found again a bifurcation point of the approximate problem $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})=0$ only in some cases. We prove that, in every situation, given $F_{h}$ that approximates $F$, there exists an approximate problem $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})-\varrho_{h} = 0$ that has a bifurcation point with the same properties as the bifurcation point of $F(\lambda,u)=0$. First, we formulate, for a function $\widehat{F}$ defined on general Banach spaces, some sufficient conditions for the existence of an equation that has a bifurcation point of certain type. For the proof of this result, we use some methods from variational analysis, Graves' theorem, one of its consequences and the contraction mapping principle for set-valued mappings. These techniques allow us to prove the existence of a solution with some desired components that equal zero of an overdetermined extended system. We then obtain the existence of a constant (or a function) $\widehat{\varrho}$ so that the equation $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u)-\widehat{\varrho} = 0$ has a bifurcation point of certain type. This equation has $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u) = 0$ as a perturbation. It is also made evident a class of maps $C^{p}$ - equivalent (right equivalent) at the bifurcation point to $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u)-\widehat{\varrho}$ at the bifurcation point. Then, for the study of the approximation of $F(\lambda,u)=0$, we give conditions that relate the exact and the approximate functions. As an application of the theorem on general Banach spaces, we formulate conditions in order to obtain the existence of the approximate equation $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})-\varrho_{h} = 0$.</description>

      <title>Quantum wave packet transforms with compact frequency support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different kinds of wave packet transforms are widely used for extracting multi-scale structures in signal processing tasks. This paper introduces the quantum circuit implementation of a broad class of wave packets, including Gabor atoms and wavelets, with compact frequency support. Our approach operates in the frequency space, involving reallocation and reshuffling of signals tailored for manipulation on quantum computers. The resulting implementation is different from the existing quantum algorithms for spatially compactly supported wavelets and can be readily extended to quantum transforms of other wave packets with compact frequency support.</description>
