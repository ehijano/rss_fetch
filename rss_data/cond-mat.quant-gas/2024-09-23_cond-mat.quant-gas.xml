      <title>Ultra spectral sensitivity and non-local bi-impurity bound states from quasi-long-range non-hermitian skin modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is that the energy spectrum of a quantum system shall remain stable against infinitesimally weak and spatially confined perturbations. In this article, we demonstrate that this principle of spectral stability fails in non-Hermitian systems at the thermodynamic limit. Consider, for instance, a non-interacting non-Hermitian system $H_0$ with a couple of point-like impurities, each of which introduces a local short-range potential $V_i$ with $i=1, \ldots, n$ labeling the impurities. If the impurity potentials are sufficiently weak, introducing a single impurity will not alter the spectrum; that is, $H_0$ and $H_0 + V_1$ have nearly identical energy spectra. However, if a second impurity is introduced, $H_0 + V_1 + V_2$, we find that no matter how weak these local potentials are, as long as the distance between them is sufficiently large, significant alterations in the energy spectrum can arise, directly contradicting the traditional expectation of a stable spectrum. Remarkably, this phenomenon is non-local, and the impact of the perturbations increases exponentially with the distance between the two impurities. In other words, although the Hamiltonian is entirely local, its energy spectrum, which is blind to the presence of a single infinitesimally weak impurity, is capable of detecting the presence of two infinitesimally weak impurities separated by a large distance in space. Using Green's function techniques, we uncover the origin of this spectral sensitivity, which arises from the formation of non-local bi-impurity bound states: non-local stationary states with wavepackets propagating back-and-forth between the two impurities. We provide an analytic theory to identify and characterize such spectral instabilities, showing perfect agreement with numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Functional Determinant Approach and its Application to Polaron Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The functional determinant approach (FDA) is a simple method to compute exactly certain observables for ideal quantum systems and has been successfully applied to the Fermi polaron problem to obtain the dynamical overlap and spectral function. Unfortunately, its application to Bosonic ultracold gases is prohibited by the failure of the grand canonical ensemble for these systems. In this paper, we show how to circumvent this problem and develop a Bosonic FDA. This yields exact injection and ejection spectra for ideal Bose polarons at arbitrary temperatures. While coherent features visible at absolute zero quickly smear out with rising temperature as expected, the line width of the main peak is, counterintuitively, found to decrease near unitarity. Furthermore, we provide explicit formulas for the overlap operator, which allow to compute the necessary determinants for both Bose and Fermi polarons more efficiently than previously possible.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. We illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. We meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>
