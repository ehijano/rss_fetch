      <title>Multi-Stream TSN Gate Control Scheduling in the Presence of Clock Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of technologies like Industry 4.0, communication networks must meet stringent requirements of applications demanding deterministic and bounded latencies. The problem is further compounded by the need to periodically synchronize network devices to a common time reference to address clock drifts. Existing solutions often simplify the problem by assuming either perfect synchronization or a worst-case error. Additionally, these approaches delay the scheduling process in network devices until the scheduled frame is guaranteed to have arrived in the device queue, inducing additional delays to the stream. A novel approach that completely avoids queuing delays is proposed, enabling it to meet even the strictest deadline requirement. Furthermore, both approaches can be enhanced by incorporating network-derived time-synchronization information. This is not only convenient for meeting deadline requirements but also improves bandwidth efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Aerial Collaborative Secure Communication Optimization via Generative Diffusion Model-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to flexibility and low-cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly crucial for enhancing coverage and functionality of wireless networks. However, incorporating UAVs into next-generation wireless communication systems poses significant challenges, particularly in sustaining high-rate and long-range secure communications against eavesdropping attacks. In this work, we consider a UAV swarm-enabled secure surveillance network system, where a UAV swarm forms a virtual antenna array to transmit sensitive surveillance data to a remote base station (RBS) via collaborative beamforming (CB) so as to resist mobile eavesdroppers. Specifically, we formulate an aerial secure communication and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (ASCEE-MOP) to maximize the secrecy rate of the system and to minimize the flight energy consumption of the UAV swarm. To address the non-convex, NP-hard and dynamic ASCEE-MOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-enabled twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) method. Specifically, GDMTD3 leverages an innovative application of diffusion models to determine optimal excitation current weights and position decisions of UAVs. The diffusion models can better capture the complex dynamics and the trade-off of the ASCEE-MOP, thereby yielding promising solutions. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with traditional deployment strategies and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks. Moreover, performance analysis under various parameter settings of GDMTD3 and different numbers of UAVs verifies the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Redefinition of Digital Twin and its Situation Awareness Framework Designing Towards Fourth Paradigm for Energy Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional knowledge-based situation awareness (SA) modes struggle to adapt to the escalating complexity of today's Energy Internet of Things (EIoT), necessitating a pivotal paradigm shift. In response, this work introduces a pioneering data-driven SA framework, termed digital twin-based situation awareness (DT-SA), aiming to bridge existing gaps between data and demands, and further to enhance SA capabilities within the complex EIoT landscape. First, we redefine the concept of digital twin (DT) within the EIoT context, aligning it with data-intensive scientific discovery paradigm (the Fourth Paradigm) so as to waken EIoT's sleeping data; this contextual redefinition lays the cornerstone of our DT-SA framework for EIoT. Then, the framework is comprehensively explored through its four fundamental steps: digitalization, simulation, informatization, and intellectualization. These steps initiate a virtual ecosystem conducive to a continuously self-adaptive, self-learning, and self-evolving big model (BM), further contributing to the evolution and effectiveness of DT-SA in engineering. Our framework is characterized by the incorporation of system theory and Fourth Paradigm as guiding ideologies, DT as data engine, and BM as intelligence engine. This unique combination forms the backbone of our approach. This work extends beyond engineering, stepping into the domain of data science -- DT-SA not only enhances management practices for EIoT users/operators, but also propels advancements in pattern analysis and machine intelligence (PAMI) within the intricate fabric of a complex system. Numerous real-world cases validate our DT-SA framework.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Efficacy of IoT-based Forest Fire Detection: a Practical Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of early warning mechanisms that can be used to detect forest fires in rural areas is essential to mitigate their deleterious effects, in particular by notifying local fire authorities to mount timely emergency responses. 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures are promising technological developments in that direction. However, in practice, the ability to detect forest fires in an effective way using distributed sensor nodes is challenging to achieve. In this short paper, we exemplify this challenge based on a case study that uses real data collected from the Low-Cost Internet of Things Sensor of Haze Air Quality Disasters in Communities in Thailand and Southeast Asia (SEA-HAZEMON) platform. The work is a preliminary step towards assessing the efficacy of a real-life fire detection system based on distributed sensor nodes. More generally, the objective is to develop a set of practical guidelines for the design of a 6G-enabled IoT-based fire detection mechanism.</description>

      <title>Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose clustered federated multitask learning to address statistical challenges in non-independent and identically distributed data across clients. Our approach tackles complexities in hierarchical wireless networks by clustering clients based on data distribution similarities and assigning specialized models to each cluster. These complexities include slower convergence and mismatched model allocation due to hierarchical model aggregation and client selection. The proposed framework features a two-phase client selection and a two-level model aggregation scheme. It ensures fairness and effective participation using greedy and round-robin methods. Our approach significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces training time, and decreases energy consumption by up to 60%, ensuring clients receive models tailored to their specific data needs.</description>

      <title>FedsLLM: Federated Split Learning for Large Language Models over Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the challenges of deploying large language models in wireless communication networks, this paper combines low-rank adaptation technology (LoRA) with the splitfed learning framework to propose the federated split learning for large language models (FedsLLM) framework. The method introduced in this paper utilizes LoRA technology to reduce processing loads by dividing the network into client subnetworks and server subnetworks. It leverages a federated server to aggregate and update client models. As the training data are transmitted through a wireless network between clients and both main and federated servers, the training delay is determined by the learning accuracy and the allocation of communication bandwidth. This paper models the minimization of the training delay by integrating computation and communication optimization, simplifying the optimization problem into a convex problem to find the optimal solution. Additionally, it presents a lemma that describes the precise solutions to this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization algorithm reduces delays by an average of 47.63% compared to unoptimized scenarios.</description>

      <title>CommRad: Context-Aware Sensing-Driven Millimeter-Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is pivotal for next-generation wireless networks, enabling high-data-rate and low-latency applications such as autonomous vehicles and XR streaming. However, maintaining directional mmWave links in dynamic mobile environments is challenging due to mobility-induced disruptions and blockage. While effective, the current 5G NR beam training methods incur significant overhead and scalability issues in multi-user scenarios. To address this, we introduce CommRad, a sensing-driven solution incorporating a radar sensor at the base station to track mobile users and maintain directional beams even under blockages. While radar provides high-resolution object tracking, it suffers from a fundamental challenge of lack of context, i.e., it cannot discern which objects in the environment represent active users, reflectors, or blockers. To obtain this contextual awareness, CommRad unites wireless sensing capabilities of bi-static radio communication with the mono-static radar sensor, allowing radios to provide initial context to radar sensors. Subsequently, the radar aids in user tracking and sustains mobile links even in obstructed scenarios, resulting in robust and high-throughput directional connections for all mobile users at all times. We evaluate this collaborative radar-radio framework using a 28 GHz mmWave testbed integrated with a radar sensor in various indoor and outdoor scenarios, demonstrating a 2.5x improvement in median throughput compared to a non-collaborative baseline.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Network Anomaly Detection under Data Contamination: Evaluating Robustness and Mitigating Performance Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a crucial tool in network anomaly detection (NAD) for cybersecurity. While DL models for anomaly detection excel at extracting features and learning patterns from data, they are vulnerable to data contamination -- the inadvertent inclusion of attack-related data in training sets presumed benign. This study evaluates the robustness of six unsupervised DL algorithms against data contamination using our proposed evaluation protocol. Results demonstrate significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms when exposed to contaminated data, highlighting the critical need for self-protection mechanisms in DL-based NAD models. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose an enhanced auto-encoder with a constrained latent representation, allowing normal data to cluster more densely around a learnable center in the latent space. Our evaluation reveals that this approach exhibits improved resistance to data contamination compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for more robust NAD systems.</description>

      <title>A Bistatic ISAC Framework for LEO Satellite Systems: A Rate-Splitting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming to achieve ubiquitous global connectivity and target detection on the same platform with improved spectral/energy efficiency and reduced onboard hardware cost, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems capable of simultaneously performing communications and radar have attracted significant attention. Designing such a joint system should address not only the challenges of integrating two functions but also the unique propagation characteristics of the satellites. To overcome severe echo signal path loss due to the high altitude of the satellite, we put forth a bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework with a radar receiver separated from the satellite. For robust and effective interference management, we employ rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), which splits and encodes users messages into private and common streams. We optimize the dual-functional precoders to maximize the minimum rate among all users while satisfying the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Given the challenge of acquiring instantaneous channel state information (iCSI) for LEO satellites, we exploit the geometrical and statistical characteristics of the satellite channel. To develop an efficient optimization algorithm, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), sequential rank-1 constraint relaxation (SROCR), and successive convex approximation (SCA) are utilized. Numerical results show that the proposed framework efficiently performs both communication and radar, demonstrating superior interference control capabilities. Furthermore, it is validated that the common stream plays three vital roles: i) beamforming towards the radar target, ii) interference management between communications and radar, and iii) interference management among communication users.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Indoor Localization Approach Using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting with SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform and Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization plays a vital role in the era of the IoT and robotics, with WiFi technology being a prominent choice due to its ubiquity. We present a method for creating WiFi fingerprinting datasets to enhance indoor localization systems and address the gap in WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation. We used the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm and employed a robotic platform to construct precise maps and localize robots in indoor environments. We developed software applications to facilitate data acquisition, fingerprinting dataset collection, and accurate ground truth map building. Subsequently, we aligned the spatial information generated via the SLAM with the WiFi scans to create a comprehensive WiFi fingerprinting dataset. The created dataset was used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for indoor localization, which can prove the usefulness of grid density. We conducted experimental validation within our office environment to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, including a heatmap from the dataset showcasing the spatial distribution of WiFi signal strengths for the testing access points placed within the environment. Notably, our method offers distinct advantages over existing approaches as it eliminates the need for a predefined map of the environment, requires no preparatory steps, lessens human intervention, creates a denser fingerprinting dataset, and reduces the WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation time. Our method achieves 26% more accurate localization than the other methods and can create a six times denser fingerprinting dataset in one-third of the time compared to the traditional method. In summary, using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting data surveyed by the SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform, we can adapt our trained DNN model to indoor localization in any dynamic environment and enhance its scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Aspects of Quantum Communications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication systems support unique applications in the form of distributed quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and several cryptographic protocols. The main enabler in these communication systems is an efficient infrastructure that is capable to transport unknown quantum states with high rate and fidelity. This feat requires a new approach to communication system design which efficiently exploits the available physical layer resources, while respecting the limitations and principles of quantum information. Despite the fundamental differences between the classic and quantum worlds, there exist universal communication concepts that may proven beneficial in quantum communication systems as well. In this survey, the distinctive aspects of physical layer quantum communications are highlighted in a attempt to draw commonalities and divergences between classic and quantum communications. More specifically, we begin by overviewing the quantum channels and use cases over diverse optical propagation media, shedding light on the concepts of crosstalk and interference. Subsequently, we survey quantum sources, detectors, channels and modulation techniques. More importantly, we discuss and analyze spatial multiplexing techniques, such as coherent control, multiplexing, diversity and MIMO. Finally, we identify synergies between the two communication technologies and grand open challenges that can be pivotal in the development of next-generation quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Applying SDN to Mobile Networks: A New Perspective for 6G Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Sixth Generation (6G) mobile communications system envisions supporting a variety of use cases with differing characteristics, e.g., very low to extremely high data rates, diverse latency needs, ultra massive connectivity, sustainable communications, ultra-wide coverage etc. To accommodate these diverse use cases, the 6G system architecture needs to be scalable, modular, and flexible; both in its user plane and the control plane. In this paper, we identify some limitations of the existing Fifth Generation System (5GS) architecture, especially that of its control plane. Further, we propose a novel architecture for the 6G System (6GS) employing Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology to address these limitations of the control plane. The control plane in existing 5GS supports two different categories of functionalities handling end user signalling (e.g., user registration, authentication) and control of user plane functions. We propose to move the end-user signalling functionality out of the mobile network control plane and treat it as user service, i.e., as payload or data. This proposal results in an evolved service-driven architecture for mobile networks bringing increased simplicity, modularity, scalability, flexibility and security to its control plane. The proposed architecture can also support service specific signalling support, if needed, making it better suited for diverse 6GS use cases. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed architecture, we also compare its performance with the 5GS using a process algebra-based simulation tool.</description>

      <title>DISTINQT: A Distributed Privacy Aware Learning Framework for QoS Prediction for Future Mobile and Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond 5G and 6G networks are expected to support new and challenging use cases and applications that depend on a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) to operate smoothly. Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged. Alternative solutions have surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes DISTINQT, a novel multi-headed input privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction. Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This enables the incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by encoding any raw input data into highly complex, compressed, and irreversible latent representations before any transmission. Evaluation results showcase that DISTINQT achieves a statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version, while also proving the validity of the privacy preserving claims. DISTINQT manages to achieve a reduction in prediction error of up to 65% on average against six state-of-the-art centralized baseline solutions presented in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.</description>

      <title>A Novel Paradigm for Neural Computation: X-Net with Learnable Neurons and Adaptable Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer perception (MLP) has permeated various disciplinary domains, ranging from bioinformatics to financial analytics, where their application has become an indispensable facet of contemporary scientific research endeavors. However, MLP has obvious drawbacks. 1), The type of activation function is single and relatively fixed, which leads to poor `representation ability' of the network, and it is often to solve simple problems with complex networks; 2), the network structure is not adaptive, it is easy to cause network structure redundant or insufficient. In this work, we propose a novel neural network paradigm X-Net promising to replace MLPs. X-Net can dynamically learn activation functions individually based on derivative information during training to improve the network's representational ability for specific tasks. At the same time, X-Net can precisely adjust the network structure at the neuron level to accommodate tasks of varying complexity and reduce computational costs. We show that X-Net outperforms MLPs in terms of representational capability. X-Net can achieve comparable or even better performance than MLP with much smaller parameters on regression and classification tasks. Specifically, in terms of the number of parameters, X-Net is only 3% of MLP on average and only 1.1% under some tasks. We also demonstrate X-Net's ability to perform scientific discovery on data from various disciplines such as energy, environment, and aerospace, where X-Net is shown to help scientists discover new laws of mathematics or physics.</description>
