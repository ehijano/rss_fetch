      <title>On Equilibrium Determinacy in Overlapping Generations Models with Money</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the local determinacy of monetary and non-monetary steady states in Tirole (1985)'s classical two-period overlapping generations model with capital and production. We show that the sufficient condition for local determinacy in endowment economies provided by Scheinkman (1980) does not generalize to models with production: there are robust examples with arbitrary utility functions in which the non-monetary steady state is locally determinate or indeterminate. In contrast, the monetary steady state is locally determinate under fairly weak conditions.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Identification in Discrete Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study identification and linear independence in random utility models. We characterize the dimension of the random utility model as the cyclomatic complexity of a specific graphical representation of stochastic choice data. We show that, as the number of alternatives grows, any linearly independent set of preferences is a vanishingly small subset of the set of all preferences. We introduce a new condition on sets of preferences which is sufficient for linear independence. We demonstrate by example that the condition is not necessary, but is strictly weaker than other existing sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Signaling With Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the canonical signaling game, endowing the sender with commitment power: before learning the state, sender designs a strategy, which maps the state into a probability distribution over actions. We provide a geometric characterization of the sender's attainable payoffs, described by the topological join of the graphs of the interim payoff functions associated with different sender actions. We extend the sender's commitment power to the design of a communication protocol, characterizing whether and how sender benefits from revealing information about the state, beyond what is inferred from his action. We apply our results to the design of adjudication procedures, rating or grading systems, and sequencing algorithms for online platforms.</description>

      <title>A duality between utility transforms and probability distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a mathematical duality between utility transforms and probability distortions. These transforms play a central role in decision under risk by forming the foundation for the classic theories of expected utility, dual utility, and rank-dependent utility. Our main results establish that probability distortions are characterized by commutation with utility transforms, and utility transforms are characterized by commutation with probability distortions. These results require no additional conditions, and hence each class can be axiomatized with only one property. Moreover, under monotonicity, rank-dependent utility transforms can be characterized by set commutation with either utility transforms or probability distortions.</description>
