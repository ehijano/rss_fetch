      <title>Mott transition from the non-analyticity of the one-body reduced density-matrix functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-body reduced density-matrix functional (1RDMF) theory has yielded promising results for small systems such as molecules, but has not addressed quantum phase transitions such as the Mott transition. Here we explicitly execute the constrained search within a variational ansatz to construct a 1RDMF for the multi-orbital Hubbard model with up to seven orbitals in the thermodynamic limit. The variational ansatz is the \mathcal{N}=3 ansatz of the variational discrete action theory (VDAT), which can be exactly evaluated in d=\infty. The resulting 1RDMF exactly encapsulates the \mathcal{N}=3 VDAT results, which accurately captures Mott and Hund physics. We find that non-analytic behavior emerges in our 1RDMF at fixed integer filling, which gives rise to the Mott transition. We explain this behavior by separating the constrained search into multiple stages, illustrating how a nonzero Hund exchange drives the continuous Mott transition to become first-order. Our approach creates a new path forward for constructing an accurate 1RDMF for strongly correlated electron materials.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product Operator Constructions for Gauge Theories in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low dimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.</description>

      <title>The numerical case for identifying paired quantum Hall phases by their daughters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many candidate non-Abelian quantum Hall states are accompanied by nearby `daughter' states, which are proposed to identify their topological order. Combining exact diagonalization and trial wave functions, we provide numerical evidence that daughter states reliably predict the parent topological phase. In the contexts of bilayer graphene and wide GaAs quantum wells, we show that the same interactions simultaneously stabilize Pfaffian, anti-Pfaffian, and their daughters, while suppressing the Jain states. The competition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, which is decided by particle-hole symmetry-breaking interactions, can likewise be deduced from their daughters. These findings strongly support the daughter-state-based identification of non-Abelian quantum Hall phases.</description>

      <title>Topologically trivial semiconducting behavior and polaronic effects in antiferromagnetic EuZn$_2$As$_2$ and EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eu-based EuA$_2$X$_2$ (A = Zn, Cd, In, Sn; X = P, As, Sb) family of compounds has recently attracted significant attention as a promising platform for exploring magnetic topological materials, with several members either predicted or reported to exhibit nontrivial topological properties. We investigate the previously reported topological semimetals, EuZn$_2$As$_2$ and EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by various first-principles computational approaches. Through examination of the cleaved surfaces, step-edges, and defect states, we determine the trivial semiconducting behavior in both material systems, with no evidence of topological surface or edge states. These experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis revealing the absence of topological band inversion in either system. Our experimental observations also reveal numerous intrinsic defects that trap charge carriers. These defects may facilitate the formation of magnetic polarons, providing a natural explanation for the colossal negative magnetoresistance observed in many of the EuA$_2$X$_2$ material systems.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the study of the Rep($D_8$) non-invertible symmetry, we show how non-invertible symmetries manifest in dynamics. By considering the effect of symmetry preserving disorder, the non-invertible symmetry is shown to give rise to degeneracies in the spectra that can only be completely lifted at orders of perturbation that scale with system size. The eigenstates of disordered Hamiltonians, whose ground state correspond to non-trivial symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, are shown to have either trivial or non-trivial SPT order that are detected as non-zero expectation value of string order-parameters. In contrast, non-trivial SPT order is absent in the eigenstates of trivial SPT Hamiltonians with disorder. The interface between two different SPT phases host edge modes whose dynamics is studied numerically and analytically. The edge mode is shown to oscillate at frequencies related to different effective chain lengths that are weighted by the temperature, becoming an exact zero mode in the limit of zero temperature. A Floquet model with the non-invertible symmetry is constructed whose edge mode is shown to exhibit period-doubled dynamics at low effective-temperatures.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic moments in FeCr2S4 studied by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the element specific magnetic characteristics of single-crystal FeCr2S4 using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS spectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong hybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized rather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are antiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule. The orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017 {\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the d6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe site, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom in spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the gigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital degrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a finite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the tetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct indicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital magnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral crystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the quenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases in rhombohedral N-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy $k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA) and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number $N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas $SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave (PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may be constrained.</description>

      <title>Gauge flux generations of weakly magnetized Dirac spin liquid in a kagom\'{e} lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent progress on the Dirac spin liquid and the kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the U(1) Dirac spin liquid on the kagom\'{e} lattice and consider the response of this quantum state to the weak magnetic field by examining the matter-gauge coupling. Even though the system is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms. The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electron coherent phonon coupling in Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ measured with ultrafast broadband spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoexcitation of single-layered La$_{0.5}$Mn$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ has played a key role in understanding orbital ordering and non-thermal states in the manganites. However, while orbital ordering in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ breaks the in-plane C$_4$ symmetry, many layered manganites show much more complex phase diagrams in which orbital ordering emerges from an already symmetry-broken high-temperature phase and also exhibit additional low-temperature phases. In this work, we examine the role of these phases in relation to orbital ordering in the single-layered manganite Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ with a combination of optical reflection anisotropy and ultrafast broadband pump-probe spectroscopy. We find that the reflection anisotropy, measured in equilibrium, is strongly sensitive to charge and orbital-ordering transition only. However, the ultrafast response, measuring the non-equilibrium state is sensitive to all phases. In particular, we deduce that coherent phonons modulate unoccupied electronic states that are sensitive to the different phases of the material. This gives rise to a non-linear scaling of the phonon signal with pump fluence at specific probe wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Anyon superfluidity of excitons in quantum Hall bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged anyons of a fractional quantum Hall fluid are necessarily dispersionless due to the continuous magnetic translation symmetry. Neutral anyons, however, can disperse, resulting in a much richer space of possible ``daughter'' states when doped to finite density. We discuss a natural realization of such physics in quantum Hall bilayers, where a finite density of excitons with fractional statistics is argued to give rise to `anyonic exciton superfluidity,' the charge-neutral analog of anyon superconductivity. In a balanced bilayer of two Laughlin $\nu = 1/3$ states, the minimal interlayer exciton carries anyonic exchange statistics. A finite density of these excitons is argued to yield an exciton superfluid stitched to a specific bulk topological order and edge spectrum. Such superfluidity should be most robust near the direct transition into the Halperin $(112)$ state, and near analogous transitions in the bilayer Jain sequence at total filling $\nu_\text{T} = 2\times \frac{n}{2n+1}$. These topological transitions can be described by Chern-Simons QED$_3$, from which we derive several novel and general properties of anyon superfluidity near such transitions, including an anomalously large superfluid stiffness of $\kappa_\text{s} \propto |\delta\nu|^{1/2}$ at layer imbalance fraction $\delta\nu$. A notable feature of the phase diagrams we construct is the prevalence of spatial symmetry breaking, driven by an underlying composite Fermi surface. Our results can be directly tested with currently available experimental techniques. We compare our theory with existing data and make concrete predictions for future measurements, including higher-pseudospin exciton superfluids when doping higher Jain fractions.</description>

      <title>Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moir\'e systems using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moir\'e materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an interlayer bias due to an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moir\'e bands. For small twist angles, the density of states as a function of filling and interlayer bias shows qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking. More interestingly, the Van Hove singularity becomes pinned to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. For aligned stacking this occurs only at zero electric field, while for antialigned stacking this happens both at zero and finite field. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1TtTMDs can be strongly tuned \textit{in situ} both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.</description>

      <title>Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers' transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile, recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume undamped vibrations, whereas atomistic simulations show that the vibrations most strongly modulating carrier's hopping amplitude are damped. Here, we use the dissipaton equations of motion (DEOM) method to compute finite-temperature real-time current autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of undamped vibrations, and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in describing experimental data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel form of non-perturbative theory to identify a light pseudo-Goldstone mode with a small mass, as well as a new type of Goldstone mode with a tiny slope (termed the slow-Goldstone mode), which may not be obtained via traditional perturbative methods. We demonstrate our formalism in the context of superfluids formed by Rashba spin-orbit coupled spinor bosons in a square lattice weakly interacting with a spin-anisotropic interaction. The experimental detections of these two modes, especially their roles leading to the quantum information scramblings at a finite temperature are discussed. The slow-Goldstone mode is compared with the slow light and the soft mode in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. This non-perturbative formalism can be widely applied to study other emergent particles in various quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments in KTaO$_3$/EuO interface, we propose an intrinsic mechanism where superconducting stripes emerge naturally without involving disorder, charge inhomogeneity, or competing orders. Our theory is based on a two-orbital model of superconductivity, where one orbital displays a quasi-one-dimensional dispersion and the other orbital is more localized and contributes pairing interactions along the perpendicular direction. Our auxiliary-field Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the pairing amplitude exhibits spatial modulation such that the superconductivity naturally disaggregates into two-leg or three-leg superconducting stripes separated by non-superconducting blocks. Our work provides a promising scenario of emergent superconducting stripes in homogeneous two-dimensional systems and reveals unexpectedly rich physics in two-orbital superconductors for future materials design.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity realisation of CNOT gate in Majorana-based optical platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Robust field re-entrant superconductivity in ferromagnetic infinite-layer rare-earth nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Emergent Self-propulsion of Skyrmionic Matter in Synthetic Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propulsion plays a crucial role in biological processes and nanorobotics, enabling small systems to move autonomously in noisy environments. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a bound skyrmion-skyrmion pair in a synthetic antiferromagnetic bilayer can function as a self-propelled topological object, reaching speeds of up to a hundred million body lengths per second--far exceeding those of any known synthetic or biological self-propelled particles. The propulsion mechanism is triggered by the excitation of back-and-forth relative motion of the skyrmions, which generates nonreciprocal gyrotropic forces, driving the skyrmion pair in a direction perpendicular to their bond. Remarkably, thermal noise induces spontaneous reorientations of the pair and momentary reversals of the propulsion, mimicking behaviors observed in motile bacteria and microalgae.</description>

      <title>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the partition function and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the partition function and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the partition function of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</description>

Abstract: We study theoretically the dynamics of frustrated spin Peierls systems after a quench from the paramagnetic state to the magnetically ordered state. By constructing and numerical simulating a minimal model, we show that it can exhibit a transient non-collinear magnetic order before settling in the equilibrium collinear magnetic order. The transient magnetic order is selected by the phonon fluctuations originated from the initial state. Our results reveal a mechanism for controlling the phases of matter by exploiting incoherent, nonequilibrium fluctuations.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of First- and Quasi-Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first-order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, quasi-second-order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first-order methods. However, the relative performance of first-order and second-order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first-order and quasi-second-order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first-order and quasi-second-order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second-order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: quasi-second-order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first-order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting far away from the ground state. This makes quasi-second-order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments begin to transition to a ferromagnetic state above 1.6 T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and noninteracting spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

Abstract: Recently, it has become possible to compute real-frequency four-point correlation functions of quantum impurity models using a multipoint extension of the numerical renormalization group (mpNRG). In this work, we perform several numerical consistency checks of the output of mpNRG by investigating exact relations between two- and four-point functions. This includes the Bethe-Salpeter equations and the Schwinger-Dyson equation from the parquet formalism, which we evaluate in two formally identical but numerically nonequivalent ways. We also study the first-order U(1) Ward identity between the vertex and the self-energy, which we derive for the first time in full generality in the real-frequency Keldysh formalism. We generally find good agreement of all relations, often up to a few percent, both at weak and at strong interaction.</description>

To do so, we derive an analytic expression for the relevant quantum geometric tensor describing two-band bosonic Bogoliubov Hamiltonians, providing insight into the geometric, topological, and transport properties. The magnon thermal Hall and spin Nernst conductivities are shown to directly depend on the altermagnetic parameter, which may serve as an experimental probe of altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Effects of Antisite Defects on Seebeck Coefficient in Fe_2VAl -- Analyses based on Bipolar Random Anderson Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A microscopic mechanism is proposed for a dramatic sign change of the Seebeck coefficient from positive to negative sign by the introduction of antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl based on bipolar random Anderson model (BPRAM), which incorporates hybridization effects between randomly distributed antisites and host bands, where the valence and conduction bands are treated separately due to their separation in momentum space. Applying a self-consistent T-matrix approximation, we find that antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl induce new states in the band overlap region, resulting in a scattering rate that is higher for hole carriers in the valence band than that for electron carriers in the conduction band, leading to negative Seebeck coefficient. This mechanism of sign change presents a potential new approach for controlling thermoelectric properties in semimetallic systems without changing carrier concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine polarized infrared magneto-transmission and Faraday angle rotation measurements to map the collective excitations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_3$. Below the N\'{e}el temperature ($T_\mathrm{N} \approx 118$ K), the phonon spectrum becomes strongly anisotropic, while a prominent excitation at 122 cm$^{-1}$ (15 meV) hardens on cooling and splits linearly with magnetic field,identifying its magnetic origin. From absolute transmission and Faraday angle measurements, we reconstruct the circular optical conductivities, revealing a pronounced dichroism of the field-split excitations. The upper branch near 129 cm$^{-1}$ shows an anomalously reduced dichroism, consistent with spin-phonon hybridization with a nearby infrared phonon. Several phonons exhibit sizable Faraday rotation, and Raman-active modes appear in the infrared spectra. Together with a broad mid-infrared band near 900 cm$^{-1}$ emerging only below $T_\mathrm{N}$, these observations point to inversion-symmetry breaking in the magnetic state. A weak Faraday feature near 320 cm$^{-1}$ ($\sim 40$ meV) further supports the presence of a higher-energy magnetic excitation. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$ and establish its relevance for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11560v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Generalized Statistics on Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistics of particles and extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information science, yet a comprehensive lattice-level framework for computing them remains elusive. In this work, we develop a universal microscopic method to determine the generalized statistics of Abelian excitations on lattices of arbitrary dimension, and demonstrate it by deriving the statistics of particles, loops, and membranes in up to three spatial dimensions. Our approach constructs a sequence of local unitary operators whose many-body Berry phase encodes the desired statistical invariant. The required sequence is generated automatically from the Smith normal form of locality constraints and therefore needs no extra physical input. We prove that the resulting invariants are quantized, provide an algorithm that computes them efficiently, and show how they unify familiar braiding and fusion data of particles while also uncovering new self- and mutual-statistics of loop and membrane excitations. We further demonstrate that each statistical invariant corresponds to an 't Hooft anomaly of a generalized symmetry; we show that a non-trivial invariant both (i) obstructs gauging that symmetry and (ii) forbids any short-range-entangled (symmetry-preserving) ground state. This establishes a precise connection between microscopic lattice anomalies and many-body dynamics, providing a generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem that constrains a wide class of quantum lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes offer a promising path to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation but lack systematic strategies for exploration. In this Letter, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. In addition to efficient characterizations using Gr\"obner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem. This approach allows us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choices of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their intrinsic link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and derive an efficient method for generating finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our Letter provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09261</link>

Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can exceed the bound of subsystem size, fail to scale with system size, or even take complex values.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space Hom$_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>
