      <title>Multicellular control of gene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological organisms are simple at heart: cells, their basic units, perform a variety of behaviors by expressing proteins from DNA-encoded genes. Gene expression though depends on sets of often-convoluted regulatory interactions known as gene networks, contributing to biology's apparent complexity. Even in Escherichia coli K-12, the pioneering model organism of molecular biology, gene networks are complicated and inconsistent with gene expression data. Recent discoveries of multicellular self-organization in E. coli suggest a new model for gene regulation that may help in many cases: control of gene networks by multicellular interaction networks, i.e. the changing physical and chemical interactions between cells in communities. E. coli's observed dynamics indicate multicellular interactions serve as inputs for key gene networks, thereby producing robust expression of otherwise noisy genes. In turn, multicellular interaction networks are dynamically generated as outputs of gene networks during self-organization. Thus, multicellular self-organization enables uniquely-biological control mechanisms that are not available to individual cells. As further suggested by E. coli self-organization, the gene-network outputs from one multicellular stage can be linked, via multicellular interaction networks, to serve as the gene-network inputs for later stages, thereby creating multicellular daisy chains. Daisy chains are a general model for reliably propagating multicellular communities and, therefore, for predictably determining the gene-network inputs of each cell throughout multicellular self-organization and development. Considerations for several fields are briefly discussed and suggest multicellular daisy chains are a general mechanism for biological organisms to control cell behavior and to be simpler than the sum of their parts.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Quercetin in Inhibiting Triple-Negative Breast Cancer by Regulating T Cell-Related Targets: An Analysis Based on Single-Cell Sequencing and Network Pharmacology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To investigate the mechanism by which quercetin inhibits triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) through regulating T-cell-related targets, providing a novel strategy for TNBC immunotherapy.Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (GSE161529 dataset) and network pharmacology were integrated. PCA and UMAP clustering identified T-cell subsets and differentially expressed genes in TNBC microenvironment. TNBC-related targets were screened via CTD and OMIM databases, with functional pathways analyzed by GO/KEGG enrichment. Molecular docking and PPI networks validated interactions between quercetin and core targets.Results: Quercetin intersected with 79 TNBC targets, including AKT1, EGFR, and MMP9, enriched in EGFR inhibitor resistance and endocrine resistance pathways. Molecular docking revealed the highest affinity between quercetin and GSK3B (-13.2 kJ/mol). AKT1 and MMP9 expression correlated with patient survival.Conclusion: Quercetin may reverse TNBC immunosuppression by multi-target modulation of T-cell function, but clinical application requires solutions for its low bioavailability, such as delivery systems or combination therapies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>

Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</description>
