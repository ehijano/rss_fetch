      <title>Transmissions and group delay time in graphene with proximity exchange field and double barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transmission and group delay time for fermions in graphene under a proximity exchange field scattered by double barriers. Solving the Dirac equation over five regions, we calculate transmission and reflection coefficients using the transfer matrix method, and analyze group delay time using a Gaussian wave packet and the stationary phase method. Our results reveal spin-dependent features in transmission and group delay time, with notable shifts between spin orientations, especially for configurations with up to three layers of boron nitride (BN). We observe enhanced Klein tunneling peaks and full transmission conditions for certain combinations of system parameters. The double-barrier configuration also significantly improves the group delay time compared to the single-barrier case. In fact, we show that the group delay time oscillates as the barrier width increases without showing signs of saturation, indicating the absence of the Hartman effect. This is in contrast to the single-barrier case, where the group delay time is found to saturate as the barrier width increases. In addition, we identify critical angles and maximum energies for evanescent modes.</description>

      <title>Laser-assisted tunneling and Hartman effect in graphene under scalar potential and exchange fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tunneling effect of Dirac fermions in a graphene sheet by introducing a potential barrier in a region of width $D$ exposed to laser field. This sheet is placed on a boron nitride/ferromagnetic substrate such as cobalt or nickel. By using the Floquet theory, we determine the solutions of the energy spectrum. We calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients by applying the boundary conditions along with the transfer matrix method. These coefficients help determine their probabilities by current densities and group delay times by their phases. We numerically show that the laser field plays a crucial role in this structure, as it completely suppresses Klein tunneling compared to the case without laser. Furthermore, in contrast to the Hartman effect, the group delay time becomes dependent on the barrier width with the appearance of additional peaks. This suggests that fermion-field interactions cause additional delays within the barrier and also help to reduce spin coupling. Adding BN layers increases the interval of transmission suppression and completely eliminates coupling after the addition of three BN layers. Total reflection is observed for incident fermions with an angle less than $-1$ or greater than one.</description>

      <title>Collective neutral excitations as sensitive probe for the quality of 2D charge carrier systems in ultra-pure GaAs quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-clean low-dimensional interacting charge carrier systems are the basis to explore correlated states and phases. We report the observation of very narrow collective intersubband excitations (ISBE) of 2D electron systems (2DESs) with ultra-high mobilities in high quality GaAs quantum well structures. These findings from resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) experiments are used as tools for exploration of links between transport mobility and collective electron behavior in 2DES of high perfection. We find that the linewidths of collective ISBE modes can be very narrow with values smaller than 80{\mu}eV. Comparison of ISBE measurements from several high-mobility samples exhibits a variation in linewidth of more than a factor of two. There is, however, a surprising lack of direct correlation between ISBE linewidth with mobility in the range 15x10^6 cm^2/Vs&lt;{\mu}&lt;24x10^6 cm^2/Vs. ISBE by RILS are discussed as a sensitive probe to characterize the interacting electron systems for fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Engineering of Dual Hall Effects in 2D Antiferromagnetic Bilayers via Interlayer Magnetic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum geometry and magnetic order offers a novel strategy for designing next-generation nanodevices. Here, we demonstrate that interlayer magnetic coupling in two-dimensional (2D) CoPSe3 bilayers enables precise control over quantum geometric mechanisms, unlocking dual intrinsic Hall effects. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the altermagnetic (AM) phase exhibits a giant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) ($\sigma_{xy}$ is approximately 46 S/cm) driven by Berry curvature localized at generic k-points, while the PT-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase hosts an intrinsic second-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE) ($\chi_{xyy}$ is approximately 160 ${\mu}$S/V) originating from quantum metric accumulation at high-symmetry k-points. By tuning interlayer magnetic couplings, we achieve reversible switching between these phases, leveraging their distinct band structures and symmetry constraints. The Neel-vector-dependent AHE in the AM phase and the symmetry-protected NAHE in the AFM phase highlight quantum geometry as a versatile tool for manipulating transport properties. Our work establishes 2D antiferromagnets as a promising platform for multifunctional device architectures, bridging linear and nonlinear magnetoelectric responses through tailored quantum geometric engineering.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonlinear valley Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valley Hall effect (VHE) holds great promise for valleytronic applications by leveraging the valley degree of freedom. To date, research on VHE has focused on its linear response to an applied current, leaving nonlinear valley responses undetected and nonlinear valleytronic devices undeveloped. Here, we report the experimental observation of a nonlinear VHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, evidenced by the generation of second-harmonic nonlocal voltages under AC currents. Remarkably, the nonlinear VHE has magnitude surpassing the linear VHE and is highly tunable via a gate voltage, which exhibits a pair of opposite peaks on the two sides of a Dirac gap. The nonlinear signal shows quadratic scaling with driving current and quartic scaling with local resistance, setting it apart from the linear counterpart. These experimental features are consistent with the theoretical picture of nonlocal transport mediated by nonlinear VHE and linear inverse VHE. We further reveal a nonlinear inverse VHE by observing the third- and fourth-harmonic nonlocal voltages. The nonlinear VHE provides a novel mechanism for valley manipulation and enables a novel valleytronic device, the valley rectifier, that converts AC charge current into DC valley current.</description>

      <title>Interfacial spin-orbit-coupling-induced strong spin-to-charge conversion at an all-oxide ferromagnetic /quasi-two-dimensional electron gas interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional oxides and hybrid structures with interfacial spin orbit coupling and the Rashba-Edelsterin effect (REE) are promising materials systems for thermal tolerance spintronic device applications. Here, we demonstrate efficient spin-to-charge conversion through enhanced interfacial spin orbit coupling at the all-oxide interface of La1-xCaxMnO3 with quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) SrTiO3 (LCMO/STO). The quasi-2D interface is generated via oxygen vacancies at the STO surface. We obtain a spin-to-charge conversion efficiency of ~ 2.32 +- 1.3 nm, most likely originating from the inverse REE, which is relatively large versus all-metallic spin-to-charge conversion materials systems. The results highlight that the LCMO/STO 2D electron gas is a potential platform for spin-based memory and transistor applications.</description>

      <title>Unconventional topological edge states in one-dimensional gapless systems stemming from nonisolated hypersurface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states have been extensively studied in systems characterized by the topological invariants in band gaps (also called line gaps). In this study, we unveil a whole new form of edge states that transcends the established paradigms of band-gap topology. In contrast to the traditional stable edge states in topological insulators with specific band gaps, the one-dimensional systems we investigate are inherently gapless with the Brillouin zones being mapped to the loops encircling hypersurface singularities in a higher-dimensional space with parity-time symmetry. These hypersurface singularities are nonisolated degeneracies embedded entirely on exceptional surfaces, rendering the energy gaps in our systems inevitably closed at the intersections of the Brillouin zone loop and the exceptional surfaces. Unexpectedly, such gapless systems still afford topologically protected edge states at system boundaries, challenging the conventional understanding based on band gaps. To elucidate the existence of these edge states in the absence of a band-gap-based invariant, we propose a theoretical framework based on eigen-frame rotation and deformation that incorporates non-Bloch band theory. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this new form of topological edge states with nonreciprocal circuits for the first time. Our work constitutes a major advance that extends topological edge states from gapped phases to gapless phases, offering new insights into topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable band-edge in few-layer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant research interest due to the variation in band-edge locations within the hexagonal Brillouin zone between single-layer and bulk configurations. In monolayers, the conduction band minima are centered at the $K$-points, whereas in multilayers, they shift to the $Q$-points, midway between the $\Gamma$ and $K$ points. In this study, we conduct magnetotransport experiments to measure the occupation in the $Q$ and $K$ valleys in fourlayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$). We demonstrate electrostatic tunability of the conduction band edge by combining our experimental results with a hybrid $k\cdot p$ tight-binding model that accounts for interlayer screening effects in a self-consistent manner. Furthermore, we extend our model to bilayer and trilayer MoS$_2$, reconciling prior experimental results and quantifying the tunable range of band edges in atomically thin TMDs.</description>

      <title>Magneto-rotation coupling for ferromagnetic nanoelement embedded in elastic substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the in-plane applied magnetic field. We found that in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field decreases with a reduction in the thickness-to-width ratio of the strip for a Rayleigh wave, whereas for a Love wave, it changes non-monotonically. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Back-action effects in charge detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge detection offers a powerful probe of mesoscopic structures based on quantum dots, but it also invariably results in measurement back-action (MBA). If strong, MBA can be detrimental to the physical properties being probed. In this work, we focus on the effects of MBA on an Anderson impurity model in which the impurity is coupled electrostatically to a detector. Introducing a novel non-perturbative method, we explore the interplay of coherent dynamics, strong correlations and non-equilibrium conditions. The effects of MBA can be seen most clearly in the temperature derivative of occupation. In the non-equilibrium case, we identify this as arising due to an energy flow from the detector to the impurity.</description>

      <title>Liquid metal intercalation of epitaxial graphene: large-area gallenene layer fabrication through gallium self-propagation at ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.12438v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of an ultra thin gallium film, also known as gallenene, beneath epitaxial graphene on 6H-SiC under ambient conditions triggered by liquid gallium intercalation. Gallenene has been fabricated using the liquid metal intercalation, achieving lateral intercalation and diffusion of Ga atoms at room temperature on square centimeter areas limited only by the graphene samples' size. The stepwise self-propagation of the gallenene film below the epitaxial graphene surface on the macroscopic scale was observed by optical microscopy shortly after the initial processing without further physical or chemical treatment. Directional Ga diffusion of gallenene occurs on SiC terraces since the terrace steps form an energetic barrier (Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier),retarding the gallenene propagation. The subsequent conversion of the epitaxial graphene into quasi free-standing bilayer graphene (QFBLG) and the graphene-gallenene heterostack interactions have been analyzed by XPS and Raman measurements. The results reveal a novel approach for controlled fabrication of wafer-scale gallenene as well as for two-dimensional heterostructures and stacks based on the interaction between liquid metal and epitaxial graphene.

      <title>Twisting in h-BN bilayers and their angle-dependent properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of twisted h-BN bilayers to understand the role of the twisting angle. Using first-principles methods with relaxation taken into account, we simulate h-BN bilayers with commensurate supercells with the smallest angle being $2.88^{\circ}$ until $60^{\circ}$. We find that the interlayer separation is not constant throughout each bilayer because of the various stacking patterns of AA, AA', AB, AB', and A'B throughout the layers, which also play a significant role in their unique charge redistribution. The calculations for the 110 generated structures show the existence of flat bands in several twisted h-BN bilayers, as well as the emergence of different trends in their properties as a function of the twist angle. These results are useful for establishing a systematic base line of registry-dependent relations for the development of more advanced computational methods to access incommensurate h-BN bilayers.</description>

      <title>Large Spin Hall Effect in High-Entropy Alloy/CoFeB Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit various physical properties, such as high microhardness for structured materials and high efficiency for catalysis. These features are recognized as a cocktail effect of five or more elements that stabilize a single-phase solid solution due to a high configurational entropy. HEAs may also exhibit short-range orders and microdistorshons, which cause the local symmetry breaking of systems. Systems with local symmetry breaking are of interest for spin-dependent transport, such as for spin Hall effects. In this study, sputtered-film samples of an HEA, Mn--Nb--Mo--Ta--W, and related alloys, were fabricated; these films were layered with ferromagnetic CoFeB. All samples exhibited x-ray diffraction peaks originating only from a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase, and transmission electron microscopy images indicated the absence of secondary phases and uniform elemental distributions. The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) was investigated, and clear resistance changes were observed in all the samples. Quantitative analysis of SMR revealed that the spin Hall angle ($\theta_\mathrm{SH}$) was 0.12 $\pm$ 0.002 and 0.14 $\pm$ 0.037 for the HEA and Nb--Mo--Ta--W alloy (medium-entropy alloy (MEA)), respectively. The $\theta_\mathrm{SH}$s of the HEA and MEA were comparable to that of Pt which is a typical heavy element with relatively large $\theta_\mathrm{SH}$. The newly developed HEA and MEA films are attractive spin Hall materials with the bcc phase and are suitable for spintronic applications using magnetic tunnel junctions with CoFeB and an MgO barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Signatures of Carrier Screening Effects on Electron-Phonon Coupling in MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is central to many condensed matter phenomena. Harnessing these effects for novel material functionality in materials always involves non-equilibrium electronic states, which in turn alter quasi-free-carrier density and screening. Thus, gaining a fundamental understanding of the interplay of carrier screening and electron-phonon coupling is essential for advancing ultrafast science. Prior works have mainly focused on the impact of carrier screening on electronic structure properties. Here we investigate the non-equilibrium lattice dynamics of MoS2 after a photoinduced Mott transition. The experimental data are closely reproduced by ab-initio ultrafast dynamics simulations. We find that the non-thermal diffuse scattering signals in the vicinity of the Bragg peaks, originating from long-wavelength phonon emission, can only be reproduced upon explicitly accounting for the screening of electron-phonon interaction introduced by the Mott transition. These results indicate the screening influences electron-phonon coupling, leading to a suppression of intravalley phonon-assisted carrier relaxation. Overall, the combined experimental and computational approach introduced here offers new prospects for exploring the influence of screening of the electron-phonon interactions and relaxation pathways in driven solids.</description>

      <title>Interaction induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state and dynamical properties of ultracold gases in optical lattices with an aperiodic external potential-a scenario motivated by recent experiments on twisted bilayer optical lattices and optical quasicrystals. Our study reveals that the interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and a quasiperiodic potential gives rise to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose glass (BG) phase, characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions, into a SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively characterized by monitoring the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: as the on-site interaction increases, the system initially transitions from BG to SF, but further increase restores the BG phase. This reentrance is ascribed to an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a once percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsive interactions dominate. Furthermore, our analysis of quench dynamics demonstrates distinct transient behaviors. Intra-phase quenches yield minimal variations in both the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the particle density distribution. In contrast, inter-phase quenches produce pronounced effects; for instance, a quench from the SF to BG phase is marked by an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, while a BG-to-SF quench features oscillatory changes in the percolation probability and a gradual decrease in the IPR, eventually stabilizing the SF phase. Our findings unveil the complex interplay between disorder and interaction in ultracold Bose gases, offering valuable insights that are highly pertinent to current experimental efforts employing twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattice platforms.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence Detection of Polytype Polarization in r-MoS2 Enabled by Asymmetric Dielectric Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rhombohedral (r) polytypes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) constitute a novel class of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials, where lateral shifts between parallel layers induce reversible out-of-plane polarization. This emerging field, known as SlideTronics, holds significant potential for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. While extensive studies have investigated the effects of electrical and chemical doping on excitonic signatures in 2H-TMDs, as well as the influence of dielectric environments on their optical properties, the impact of intrinsic polarization in asymmetric environments remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a striking polarization-dependent photoluminescence (PL) contrast of up to 400\% between ferroelectric domains in bilayer and trilayer rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide (r-MoS2). This pronounced contrast arises from an asymmetric dielectric environment, which induces polarization-dependent shifts in the Fermi energy, leading to a modulation of the exciton-trion population balance. A detailed temperature-dependent line shape analysis of the PL, conducted from 4K to room temperature, reveals domain-specific trends that further reinforce the connection between polarization states and excitonic properties. The persistence of these distinct optical signatures at room temperature establishes PL as a robust and non-invasive probe for ferroelectric domain characterization, particularly in fully encapsulated device architectures where conventional techniques, such as Kelvin probe force microscopy, become impractical.</description>

      <title>Orbital textures and evolution of correlated insulating state in monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interaction can induce Mott insulating state, which is believed to host unusual correlated phenomena such as quantum spin liquid when quantum fluctuation dominates and unconventional superconductivity through doping. Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms - scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. By comparing the binding site preferences of carboxylic acids obtained from electronic structure calculations, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution, and thus the binding site preference depends on the surface thickness and coverage. We found that the oxidation state distribution, and consequently binding site preference, depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method presented here needs no interface specific parameterization, ensuring seamless compatibility with popular bimolecular force fields providing transferability, and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal intercalation in epitaxial graphene enables the emergence of proximity-induced superconductivity and modified quantum transport properties. However, systematic transport studies of intercalated graphene have been hindered by challenges in device fabrication, including processing-induced deintercalation and instability under standard lithographic techniques. Here, we introduce a lithographically controlled intercalation approach that enables the scalable fabrication of gallium-intercalated quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) Hall bar devices. By integrating lithographic structuring with subsequent intercalation through dedicated intercalation channels, this method ensures precise control over metal incorporation while preserving device integrity. Magneto-transport measurements reveal superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc,onset ~ 3.5 K and the occurrence of a transverse resistance, including both symmetric and antisymmetric field components, which is attributed to the symmetric-in-field component to non-uniform currents. These results establish an advanced fabrication method for intercalated graphene devices, providing access to systematic investigations of confined 2D superconductivity and emergent electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moir\'e systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the local effects of a single short-range impurity on the electron system of a short ballistic graphene Josephson Junction. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between topological Majorana and trivial zero modes via transport and shot noise study in an altermagnet heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport and shot noise properties of a one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling~(SOC) placed in closed proximity to a bulk $s$-wave superconductor and an altermagnet with $d$-wave symmetry. Such heterostructure with vanishing net magnetization manifests itself as an alternative route to anchor Majorana zero modes~(MZMs) characterized by appropriate topological index~(winding number $W$). Interestingly, this system also hosts accidental zero modes~(AZMs) emerged with vanishing topological index indicating their non-topological nature. Furthermore, by incorporating three terminal setup, we explore the transport and shot noise signatures of these zero modes. At zero temperature, we obtain zero bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance to be quantized with value $|W|\times 2 e^{2}/h$ for MZMs. On the other hand, AZMs exhibit non-quantized value at zero bias. Moreover, zero temperature shot noise manifests negative~(positive) value for MZMs~(AZMs) within the bulk gap. At finite temperature, shot noise exhibits negative value~(negative to positive transition) concerning MZMs~(AZMs). Thus, the obtained signatures clearly distinguish between the MZMs and non-topological AZMs. We extend our analysis by switching on the next to nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and SOC. Our conclusion remains unaffected for this case as well. Hence, our work paves the way to differentiate between emergent MZMs and AZMs in a semiconductor/ superconductor/ altermagnet heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the projector to the filled lattice eigenstates on a specific position, or applying the local electron annihilation operator on the many-body ground state, one can construct a quantum state localized around a specific position in a solid. The overlap of two such local states at slightly different positions defines a quantum metric in real space, which manifests even in systems as simple as particles in a box. For continuous systems like electron gas, this metric weighted by the density gives the momentum variance of electrons, which is readily measurable by ARPES. The presence of disorder curves the real space manifold and gives rise to various differential geometrical quantities like Riemann tensor and Ricci scalar, indicating the possibility of engineering differential geometrical properties by disorder, as demonstrated by lattice models of 2D metals and topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: Ion dehydration has been hypothesized to strongly influence separation performance in membrane systems and ion transport in nanoscale channels. However, the molecular details of ion dehydration in membranes are not well understood, in particular under the high pressures and concentrations required for brine treatment. In this study, we define \textit{de-coordination} as the process by which an ion decreases its total coordination number, including both water molecules and counterions. We estimate the de-coordination free energies in bulk solution for a range of different ions at high pressure and salinity relevant to brine treatment using molecular simulation. We also propose alternatives to the coordination number as the size constraint for traversing nanoscale constrictions, such as the maximum cross-sectional area of the complexed ion. We show that high operating pressures do not significantly change cation hydration shell stability nor the shell size, while high ionic concentrations lower the free energy barrier to reduce the cation coordination number. We find that anion de-coordination free energies are largely unaffected by elevated salinity and pressure conditions. Finally, we discuss the implications on ion-ion selectivity in separations membranes (e.g. extracting lithium from salt-lake brines) due to the effects of elevated pressure and salinity on ion de-coordination.</description>

Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.</description>

      <title>Spin injection and detection in all-van der Waals 2D devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we report efficient out-of-plane spin injection and detection in an all-van der Waals based heterostructure using only exfoliated 2D materials. We demonstrate spin injection by measuring spin-valve and Hanle signals in non-local transport in a stack of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene layers. FGT flakes form the spin aligning electrodes necessary to inject and detect spins in the graphene channel. The hBN tunnel barrier provides a high-quality interface between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene, eliminating the conductivity mismatch problem, thus ensuring efficient spin injection and detection with spin injection efficiencies of up to $P=40$\%. Our results demonstrate that FGT/hBN/graphene heterostructures form a promising platform for realizing 2D van der Waals spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited amplification without instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum parametric amplifiers typically generate by operating in proximity to a point of dynamical instability. We consider an alternate general strategy where quantum-limited, large-gain amplification is achieved without any proximity to a dynamical instability. Our basic mechanism (involving dynamics that conserves the number of squeezed photons) enables the design of a variety of one and two mode amplifiers that are not limited by any fundamental gain-bandwidth constraint. We focus on a particular realization that allows us to realize an ideal single-mode squeezing operation in transmission, and which has zero reflection. We present both a thorough theoretical analysis of this system (including pump-depletion effects), and also discuss results of an experimental superconducting quantum circuit implementation.</description>

      <title>Dicke superradiant enhancement of the heat current in circuit QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.</description>

      <title>Optical control of electrons in a Floquet topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-dressed materials hold enormous potential for generating new electronic properties. The band structure resulting from light-dressing can exhibit starkly different quantum and topological phenomena. So far, optical control of charge within a light-dressed band structure has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate optical control of electrons in light-dressed graphene. By focusing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses at 1550 nm on monolayer graphene, we generate a Floquet topological insulator (FTI). With a phase-locked second harmonic field, we dynamically control electrons in this FTI state. For the first time, we observe photocurrent circular dichroism, the all-optical anomalous Hall effect, and FTI valley-polarized currents. The photocurrents show strong sub-cycle phase-sensitivity, opening the door to ultrafast control within topologically protected electronics (topotronics), spectroscopy, and attosecond physics in novel quantum materials.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established phase retrieval algorithms. In this work, we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored to X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) single-shot single-particle diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. By comparing the axion effect with thermal effect on the width $\Delta B$, we have shown the dominance of the axion effect over thermal effect at low temperature less than $50$mK. The dominance of the axion effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of van der Waals layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous progress in spintronic studies of van der Waals (vdW) room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2, much less effort has been spent on its lattice dynamics and possible interaction with spintronic degrees of freedom. In this work, by combining Raman spectroscopy in a wide range of pressure (atmospheric pressure~19.5 GPa) and temperature (80~690 K) with first-principles calculation, we systematically studied the lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of Fe3GaTe2. Our results show that the phonon energies of Fe3GaTe2 located at 126.0 cm-1 and 143.5 cm-1 originate from the anharmonic and harmonic vibration modes, respectively. Furthermore, the first room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in vdW ferromagnet is observed with strength of ~0.81 cm-1 at 300 K, by identifying Raman anomalies in both phonon energy and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of below Curie temperature of Fe3GaTe2. Our findings are valuable for fundamental and applied studies of vdW materials under variable conditions.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition: effective field theory and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</description>
