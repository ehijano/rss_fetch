      <title>Deposition Rates in Thermal Laser Epitaxy: Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of deposition rates in Thermal Laser Epitaxy (TLE) is essential for the accurate prediction of the evaporation process and for improved dynamic process control. We demonstrate excellent agreement between experimental data and a model based on a finite element simulation that describes the temperature distribution of an elemental source when irradiated with continuous wave laser radiation. The simulation strongly depends on the thermophysical constants of the material, data of which is lacking for many elements. Effective values for the parameters may be determined with precision by means of an unambiguous reference provided by the melting point of the material, which is directly observed during the experiments. TLE may therefore be used to study the high temperature thermophysical and optical properties of the elements.</description>

      <title>From Occasional to Steady: Habit Formation Insights From a Comprehensive Fitness Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exercising regularly is widely recognized as a cornerstone of health, yet the challenge of sustaining consistent exercise habits persists. Understanding the factors that influence the formation of these habits is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study utilizes data from Mars Athletic Club, T\"urkiye's largest sports chain, to investigate the dynamics of gym attendance and habit formation. The general problem addressed by this study is identifying the critical periods and factors that contribute to the successful establishment of consistent exercise routines among gym-goers. Here we show that there are specific periods during which gym attendance is most crucial for habit formation. By developing a survival metric based on gym attendance patterns, we pinpoint these critical periods and segment members into distinct clusters based on their visit patterns. Our analysis reveals significant differences in how various subgroups respond to interventions, such as group classes, personal trainer sessions, and visiting different clubs. Using causal inference analysis, we demonstrate that personalized guidance and social dynamics are key drivers of sustained long-term engagement. By systematically examining these variables and considering the specific characteristics of different clusters, our research demonstrates the importance of a tailored, multi-dimensional approach to promoting exercise habits, which integrates social dynamics, personalized guidance, and strategic interventions to sustain long-term engagement.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of knowledge-learning preferences in large language models in molecular science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced molecular modeling and design, enabling efficient understanding and discovery of novel molecules. In particular, large language models (LLMs) introduce a fresh research paradigm to tackle scientific problems from a natural language processing (NLP) perspective. LLMs significantly enhance our understanding and generation of molecules, often surpassing existing methods with their capabilities to decode and synthesize complex molecular patterns. However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the match between model and data modalities and how to identify the knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1263 experiments to assess the model's compatibility with data modalities and knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering. Our analysis offers an exploration of the learning mechanism and paves the way for advancing LLMs in molecular science.</description>

      <title>Can AI Help with Your Personal Finances?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.</description>
