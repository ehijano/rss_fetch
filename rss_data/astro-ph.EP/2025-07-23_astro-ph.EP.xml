      <title>Building Earth with pebbles made of chondritic components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pebble accretion provides new insights into Earth's building blocks and early protoplanetary disk conditions. Here, we show that mixtures of chondritic components: metal grains, chondrules, calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), and amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs) match Earth's major element composition (Fe, Ni, Si, Mg, Ca, Al, O) within uncertainties, whereas no combination of chondrites and iron meteorites does. Our best fits also match the $\epsilon^{54}$Cr and $\epsilon^{50}$Ti values of Earth precisely, whereas the best fits for chondrites, or components with a high proportion of E chondrules, fail to match Earth. In contrast to some previous studies, our best-fitting component mixture is predominantly carbonaceous, rather than enstatite chondrules. It also includes 15 wt% of early-formed refractory inclusions (CAIs + AOAs), which is similar to that found in some C chondrites (CO, CV, CK), but notably higher than NC chondrites. High abundances of refractory materials are lacking in NC chondrites, because they formed after the majority of refractory grains were either drawn into the Sun or incorporated into terrestrial protoplanets via pebble accretion. We show that combinations of Stokes numbers of chondritic components build 0.35-0.7 Earth masses in 2 My in the Hill regime accretion, for a typical pebble column density of 1.2 kg/m2 at 1 au. However, a larger or smaller column density leads to super-Earth or moon-mass bodies, respectively. Our calculations also demonstrate that a few My of pebble accretion with these components yields a total protoplanet mass inside 1 au exceeding the combined masses of Earth, Moon, Venus, and Mercury. Accordingly, we conclude that pebble accretion is a viable mechanism to build Earth and its major element composition from primitive chondritic components within the solar nebula lifetime.</description>

      <title>TOI-880 is an Aligned, Coplanar, Multi-planet System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although many cases of stellar spin-orbit misalignment are known, it is usually unclear whether a single planet's orbit was tilted or if the entire protoplanetary disk was misaligned. Measuring stellar obliquities in multi-transiting planetary systems helps to distinguish these possibilities. Here, we present a measurement of the sky-projected spin-orbit angle for TOI-880 c (TOI-880.01), a member of a system of three transiting planets, using the Keck Planet Finder (KPF). We found that the host star is a K-type star ($T_{\rm eff}=5050 \pm 100$ K). Planet b (TOI-880.02) has a radius of $2.19\pm0.11\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and an orbital period of $2.6$ days; planet c (TOI-880.01) is a Neptune-sized planet with $4.95\pm0.20\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ on a $6.4$-day orbit; and planet d (TOI-880.03) has a radius of $3.40_{-0.21}^{+0.22}\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and a period of $14.3$ days. By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we found the sky-projected obliquity to be $|\lambda_c| = 7.4_{-7.2}^{+6.8}$$^{\circ}$, consistent with a prograde, well-aligned orbit. The lack of detectable rotational modulation of the flux of the host star and a low $\rm v\sin{i_\star}$ (1.6~km/s) imply slow rotation and correspondingly slow nodal precession of the planetary orbits and the expectation that the system will remain in this coplanar configuration. TOI-880 joins a growing sample of well-aligned, coplanar, multi-transiting systems. Additionally, TOI-880 c is a promising target for JWST follow-up, with a transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM) of $\sim 170$. We could not detect clear signs of atmospheric erosion in the H$\alpha$ line from TOI-880 c, as photoevaporation might have diminished for this mature planet.</description>

      <title>The mass of TOI-654 b: A short-period sub-Neptune transiting a mid-M dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes are small planets between the size of the Earth and Neptune. The orbital and bulk properties of transiting sub-Neptunes can provide clues for their formation and evolution of small planets. In this paper, we report on follow-up observations of a planetary system around the mid-M dwarf TOI-654, whose transiting sub-Neptune TOI-654 b ($P=1.53$ day) is validated as a suitable target for the atmospheric observation. We measure the planetary mass and stellar properties with the InfraRed Doppler instrument (IRD) mounted on the Subaru telescope and obtain the stellar and planetary properties from additional transit observations by the Transit Exoplanetary Survey Satellite (TESS) and a series of the Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT). As a result, the planetary mass of TOI-654 b is determined to be $M_{{\rm p}} = 8.71 \pm 1.25 M_{\oplus}$, and the radius is updated to be $R_{\rm p} = 2.378 \pm 0.089 R_{\oplus}$. The bulk density suggests that the planet is composed of a rocky and volatile-rich core or a rocky core surrounded by a small amount of H/He envelope.TOI-654 b is one of unique planets located around the radius valley and and also on the outer edge of the Neptune desert. The precise mass determination enables us to constrain the atmospheric properties with future spectroscopic observations especially for the emission by the James Webb Space Telescope and Ariel.</description>

      <title>Assessing robustness and bias in 1D retrievals of 3D Global Circulation Models at high spectral resolution: a WASP-76 b simulation case study in emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16687v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) of exoplanet atmospheres has successfully detected many chemical species and is quickly moving toward detailed characterization of the chemical abundances and dynamics. HRS is highly sensitive to the line shape and position, thus, it can detect three-dimensional (3D) effects such as winds, rotation, and spatial variation of atmospheric conditions. At the same time, retrieval frameworks are increasingly deployed to constrain chemical abundances, pressure-temperature (P-T) structures, orbital parameters, and rotational broadening. To explore the multidimensional parameter space, they need computationally fast models that are consequently mostly one-dimensional (1D). However, this approach risks introducing interpretation bias since the planet's true nature is 3D. We investigate the robustness of this methodology at high spectral resolution by running 1D retrievals on simulated observations in emission within an observational framework using 3D Global Circulation Models of the quintessential HJ WASP-76 b. We find that the retrieval broadly recovers conditions present in the atmosphere, but that the retrieved P-T and chemical profiles are not a homogeneous average of all spatial and phase-dependent information. Instead, they are most sensitive to spatial regions with large thermal gradients, which do not necessarily coincide with the strongest emitting regions. Our results further suggest that the choice of parameterization for the P-T and chemical profiles, as well as Doppler offsets among opacity sources, impact retrieval results. These factors should be carefully considered in future retrieval analyses.</description>

      <title>Considering contact forces during the formation of planetesimals by gravitational collapse: mutual orbits, spin states, and shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) within the PKDGRAV N-body integrator to investigate the formation of planetesimal systems through the gravitational collapse of clouds of super-particles. Previously published numerical models have demonstrated that the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds is an efficient pathway to produce binary planetesimal systems. However, such investigations were limited by their use of a perfect-merger and inflated-radii super-particle approach, which inhibits any analysis of planetesimal shapes and spin states, precludes the formation of the tightest binary orbits, and produces significantly under-dense planetesimals. The SSDEM enables super-particles to rest upon each other through mutual surface penetration and by simulating contact physics. Super-particles do not need to be inflated and collisions are not treated as perfect mergers; we can thus track the evolution of planetesimal shapes, spins, and tight binary orbits. We demonstrate that the SSDEM is an excellent method to model the collapse process, and is capable of producing many binary planetesimal systems from a single cloud. Our results confirm the findings of previously published perfect-merging models while also producing novel results about planetesimal spin and shape properties. Newly-formed planetesimals exhibit 10-hr rotation periods on average and can be characterized by a wide variety of shapes (spherical, oblate, top-shaped, flattened, egg-shaped, or prolate), with the most-massive planetesimals primarily forming as spheres and oblate-spheroids.</description>

      <title>Silicate mineralogy and bulk composition of exoplanetary material in polluted white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf planetary systems uniquely link the bulk elemental composition of exoplanetary material to the mineralogy as photospheric abundances can be compared to circumstellar dust mineralogy. This study re-examines Spitzer/IRS spectra of eight white dwarfs with both circumstellar dust and photospheric metals. All systems show 10$\mu$m silicate emission features consistent with a mixture of olivine and pyroxene silicates, with varying dominance. New Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of two of these systems, GD56 and WD1150-153, reveal that both are accreting dry, rocky material. WD1150-153 is accreting material consistent with Bulk Earth, while GD56 is accreting core-rich material with an inferred core mass fraction of 0.59$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (0.37$^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ by mole). A comparison between the bulk elemental composition of the accreted planetary material and the dust mineralogy of the eight systems reveals a tentative correlation between the dominant silicate mineralogy and the Mg/Si ratio, indicating that the circumstellar and photospheric material are compositionally similar. This suggests that rapid and well-mixed accretion is occurring with minimal compositional alteration. Furthermore, new GGCHEM equilibrium chemistry models confirm that Mg-rich planetary material preferentially forms olivine-rich dust, highlighting the importance of equilibrium in planetary chemistry and that a host star or rock's Mg/Si can be used to predict whether its silicate mineralogy is olivine- or pyroxene-dominated, influencing its capacity to structurally store water, recycle key nutrients, and possibly habitability.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Empirical Estimate of Solar EUV Evolution from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; 100 -- 911 \AA) spectra of F, G, K, and M stars provide diagnostics of the stellar chromosphere through the corona, with line and continuum formation temperatures spanning roughly 10$^{4}$ - 10$^{7}$ K. The EUV stellar spectrum in turn drives atmospheric photochemistry and numerous escape processes on orbiting planets. We present a new study of the EUV history of solar-type stars, using new and archival {\it Hubble Space Telescope} observations of solar analogs (T$_{\odot}$ $\pm$ 150 K for stars older than 100 Myr) and ``Young Suns" (age $&lt;$ 100 Myr) that will evolve into main sequence early G-type stars to predict the 90 -- 360 \AA\ EUV flux from a sample of 23 stars. We find that the EUV activity evolution for solar-type stars follows a two-component behavior: a saturated L(EUV)/L$_{bol}$ plateau (at a level of about 10$^{-4}$) followed by a power law decay ($\alpha$ $\approx$ $-$1.1) after ages of $\approx$ 50 -- 100 Myr. Consequently, the EUV flux incident at 1 AU around solar analogs varies over the lifetime of the Sun, ranging from 100 $\times$ the present day UV irradiance at 10 Myr to 0.3 $\times$ the present-day level at 10 Gyr. We find that the EUV luminosity is approximately the same as the soft X-ray luminosity up to approximately 1 Gyr, after which the EUV luminosity of the stars dominate. In comparison to Sun-like stars, the EUV saturation level of early/mid M dwarfs is several times higher and lasts $\sim$10 -- 20 times longer.</description>

      <title>ARTEMIS observations of electrostatic shocks inside the lunar wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the solar wind encounters the Moon, a plasma void forms downstream of it, known as the lunar wake. In regions where the magnetic field is quasi-parallel to the plasma-vacuum boundary normal, plasma refills the wake primarily along magnetic field lines. As faster electrons outpace slower ions, an ambipolar electric field is generated, accelerating ions and decelerating electrons. Recent particle-in-cell simulations have shown that when accelerated supersonic ion beams from opposite sides of the wake meet near the wake center, electrostatic shocks may form, decelerating ions and heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions. Using data from the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft, we present the first observational evidence of the predicted electrostatic shocks. Near the wake center of one event, we observed an electrostatic solitary structure with an amplitude of ~2 mV/m and a spatial scale of ~50 local Debye lengths. This structure generated a potential increase of ~50 V from upstream to downstream, heating incoming electrons by ~50 eV in the parallel direction while decelerating ions by ~60 km/s leading to a density enhancement. At a second event representing a more evolved stage, we observed more dissipated structures dominated by strong electrostatic waves, with persistent potential increases driving continued field-aligned electron heating and ion deceleration. These observations confirm simulation predictions of electrostatic shock formation and the associated particle dynamics within the lunar wake, with potential applications to understanding plasma interactions around other airless celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of coupled sociopolitical events-planetary boundaries, crises, policrisis and Earth System syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of the human activities can be evaluated by the Planetary Boundaries (PBs), however, so far it is not clear how to assess the influence of specific sociopolitical events (SPEs) on the Earth System (ES) and at the same measure, without a suitable framework, to gauge how these affect the PBs. In this work, we propose an interacting matrix model that couples SPEs with the PBs and consider the possible evolution scenarios and, in particular, those leading to crises and policrisis. We address specifically the situation where the PBs evolve according to the continuous logistic function, and then consider an exponentially-evolving SPE, which we show to cause a runaway effect on the PBs. We also propose a way to describe, classify, and compare sociopolitical syndromes, that is, a set composed of more than a single polycrisis.</description>

      <title>Is Ozone a Reliable Proxy for Molecular Oxygen? II. The impact of N$_2$O on the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship for Earth-like atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular oxygen (O2) will be an important molecule in the search for biosignatures in terrestrial planetary atmospheres in the coming decades. In particular, O2 combined with a reducing gas is thought to be strong evidence for disequilibrium caused by surface life. However, there are circumstances where it would be very difficult or impossible to detect O2, in which cases it has been suggested that ozone (O3), the photochemical product of O2, could be used instead. Unfortunately, the O2-O3 relationship is highly nonlinear and dependent on the host star, as shown in detail in the first paper in this series. We explore the O2-O3 relationship around G0V-M5V host stars, using climate/photochemistry modeling to simulate atmospheres while varying abundances of O2 and nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O is of particular importance to the O2-O3 relationship not just because it is produced biologically, but because it is the primary source of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which fuel the NOx catalytic cycle which destroys O3, and the smog mechanism that produces O3. We vary the O2 mixing ratio from 0.01-150% present atmospheric level (PAL), and N2O abundances of 10% and 1000% PAL. We find that varying N2O impacts the O2-O3 relationship differently depending strongly on both the host star and the amount of atmospheric O2. Planets orbiting hotter hosts with strong UV fluxes efficiently convert N2O into NOx, often depleting a significant amount of O3 via faster NOx catalytic cycles. However, for cooler hosts and low O2 levels we find that increasing N2O can lead to an increase of overall O3 due to the smog mechanism producing O3 in the lower atmosphere. Variations in O3 result in significant changes in the amount of harmful UV reaching the surfaces of the model planets as well as the strength of the 9.6 $\mu$m O3 emission spectral feature, demonstrating potential impacts on habitability and future observations.</description>

Abstract: Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.</description>
