      <title>Deep Learning and IACT: Bridging the gap between Monte-Carlo simulations and LST-1 data using domain adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next generation of observatories employing the imaging air Cherenkov technique for the study of very high energy gamma rays. The deployment of deep learning methods for the reconstruction of physical attributes of incident particles has evinced promising outcomes when conducted on simulations. However, the transition of this approach to observational data is accompanied by challenges, as deep learning-based models are susceptible to domain shifts. In this paper, we integrate domain adaptation in the physics-based context of the CTAO and shed light on the gain in performance that these techniques bring using LST-1 real acquisitions.</description>

      <title>Statistical estimation of full-sky radio maps from 21cm array visibility data using Gaussian Constrained Realisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important application of next-generation wide-field radio interferometers is making high dynamic range maps of radio emission. Traditional deconvolution methods like CLEAN can give poor recovery of diffuse structure, prompting the development of wide-field alternatives like Direct Optimal Mapping and $m$-mode analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative Bayesian method to infer the coefficients of a full-sky spherical harmonic basis for a drift-scan telescope with potentially thousands of baselines. The can precisely encode the uncertainties and correlations between the parameters used to build the recovered image. We use Gaussian Constrained Realisations (GCR) to efficiently draw samples of the spherical harmonic coefficients, despite the very large parameter space and extensive sky-regions of missing data. Each GCR solution provides a complete, statistically-consistent gap-free realisation of a full-sky map conditioned on the available data, even when the interferometer's field of view is small. Many realisations can be generated and used for further analysis and robust propagation of statistical uncertainties. In this paper, we present the mathematical formalism of the spherical harmonic GCR-method for radio interferometers. We focus on the recovery of diffuse emission as a use case, along with validation of the method against simulations with a known diffuse emission component.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional inference of radio interferometer beam patterns I: Parametric model of the HERA beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of the primary beam is an important but difficult task in radio astronomy. For high dynamic range problems such as 21cm intensity mapping, small modelling errors in the sidelobes and spectral structure of the beams can translate into significant systematic errors. Realistic beams exhibit complex spatial and spectral structure, presenting a major challenge for beam measurement and calibration methods. In this paper series, we present a Bayesian framework to infer per-element beam patterns from the interferometric visibilities for large arrays with complex beam structure, assuming a particular (but potentially uncertain) sky model and calibration solution. In this first paper, we develop a compact basis for the beam so that the Bayesian computation is tractable with high-dimensional sampling methods. We use the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) as an example, verifying that the basis is capable of describing its single-element E-field beam (i.e. without considering array effects like mutual coupling) with a relatively small number of coefficients. We find that 32 coefficients per feed, incident polarization, and frequency, are sufficient to give percent-level and $\sim$10\% errors in the mainlobe and sidelobes respectively for the current HERA Vivaldi feeds, improving to $\sim 0.1\%$ and $\sim 1\%$ for 128 coefficients.</description>

      <title>Combining Gaia and GRAVITY: Characterising Five New Directly Detected Substellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here, we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high angular resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work for eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which being previously unknown and five of substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at a angular separation of (34.01 $\pm$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. In combination with the system's distance this translates to a physical separation of (1.054 $\pm$ 0.002) AU. The GRAVITY data are then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enables us to further characterise them in terms of their age, effective temperature and radius by the application of evolutionary models. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular resolution direct imaging hold great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly-imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of the Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.</description>

      <title>A multilevel framework for accelerating uSARA in radio-interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a multilevel algorithm specifically designed for radio-interferometric imaging in astronomy. The proposed algorithm is used to solve the uSARA (unconstrained Sparsity Averaging Reweighting Analysis) formulation of this image restoration problem. Multilevel algorithms rely on a hierarchy of approximations of the objective function to accelerate its optimization. In contrast to the usual multilevel approaches where this hierarchy is derived in the parameter space, here we construct the hierarchy of approximations in the  observation space. The proposed approach is compared to a reweighted forward-backward procedure, which is the backbone iteration scheme for solving the uSARA problem.</description>

      <title>Accurate Power Spectrum Estimation toward Nyquist limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum, as a statistic in Fourier space, is commonly numerically calculated using the fast Fourier transform method to efficiently reduce the computational costs. To alleviate the systematic bias known as aliasing due to the insufficient sampling, the interlacing technique was proposed. We derive the analytical form of the shot noise under the interlacing technique, which enables the exact separation of the Poisson shot noise from the signal in this case. Thanks to the accurate shot noise subtraction, we demonstrate an enhancement in the accuracy of power spectrum estimation, and compare with the other widely used estimators in community. The good performance of our estimation allows an abatement in the computational cost by using low resolution and low order mass assignment scheme in the analysis for huge surveys and mocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) has been operating for more than 15 years as an international facility dedicated to advancing compelling multidisciplinary underground scientific research in rare-process physics, as well as offering research opportunities in other disciplines. SURF laboratory facilities include a Surface Campus as well as campuses at the 4850-foot level (1490 m, 4300 m.w.e.) that host a range of significant physics experiments, including the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment. The CASPAR nuclear astrophysics accelerator completed the first phase of operation and is planning for the second phase beginning in 2024. SURF is also home to the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) that will host the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SURF offers world-class service, including an ultralow background environment, low-background assay capabilities, and electroformed copper is produced at the facility. SURF is preparing to increase underground laboratory space. Plans are advancing for construction of new large caverns (nominally 100m L x 20m W x 24m H) on the 4850L (1485 m, 4100 m.w.e.) on the timeframe of next generation experiments (~2030). SURF plans to leverage existing advisory and community committees as well as engage the underground science community to inform plans for future laboratory space.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Bayesian 21 cm power spectrum estimation to foreground model errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power spectrum estimators are an important tool in efforts to detect the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations from neutral hydrogen at early times. An initial detection will likely be statistical in nature, meaning that it will not be possible to make a coherent map of the brightness temperature fluctuations; instead, only their variance will be measured against a background of noise and residual systematic effects. Optimal Quadratic Estimator (OQE)-based methods often apply an inverse covariance weighting to the data. However, inaccurate covariance modelling can lead to reduced sensitivity and, in some cases, severe signal loss. We recently proposed a Bayesian method to jointly estimate the 21 cm fluctuations, their power spectrum, and foreground emission. Instead of requiring a fixed a priori estimate of the covariance, we estimate the covariance as part of the inference. Choices of parametrization, particularly of the foregrounds, are subject to model errors and could lead to biases and other ill effects if not properly controlled. In this paper, we investigate the effects of inaccurate foreground models on 21 cm power spectrum recovery. Using simulated visibilities, we find that, even in the most extreme scenarios tested, our approach is capable of recovering 21 cm delay power spectrum estimates consistent with a known input signal for delays $\gtrsim300$ ns ($\sim$88\% of the available Fourier modes). This is true even when using foreground models derived from modified foreground catalogs containing spatial and spectral perturbations at the quoted level of uncertainty on our foreground catalogs.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Primer on Classical Period-Finding Techniques in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is to investigate the properties of the classical phase-dispersion minimization (PDM), analysis of variance (AOV), string-length (SL), and Lomb-Scargle (LS) power statistics from a statistician's perspective. We confirm that when the data are perturbations of a constant function, i.e. under the null hypothesis of no period in the data, a scaled version of the PDM statistic follows a beta distribution, the AOV statistic follows an F distribution, and the LS power follows a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. However, the SL statistic does not have a closed-form distribution. We further verify these theoretical distributions through simulations and demonstrate that the extreme values of these statistics (over a range of trial periods), often used for period estimation and determination of the false alarm probability (FAP), follow different distributions than those derived for a single period. We emphasize that multiple-testing considerations are needed to correctly derive FAP bounds. Though, in fact, multiple-testing controls are built into the FAP bound for these extreme-value statistics, e.g. the FAP bound derived specifically for the maximum LS power statistic over a range of trial periods. Additionally, we find that all of these methods are robust to heteroscedastic noise aimed to mimic the degradation or miscalibration of an instrument over time. Finally, we examine the ability of these statistics to detect a non-constant periodic function via simulating data that mimics a well-detached binary system, and we find that the AOV statistic has the most power to detect the correct period, which agrees with what has been observed in practice.</description>

      <title>ExoCubed: A Riemann-Solver based Cubed-Sphere Dynamic Core for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical-polar (or lat-lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders of magnitude smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.</description>
