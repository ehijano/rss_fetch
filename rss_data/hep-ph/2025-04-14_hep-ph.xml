      <title>Photon Excess from Dark Matter and Neutrino Scattering at MiniBooNE and MicroBooNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new solutions to accommodate both the MiniBooNE electron-like and MicroBooNE photon low-energy excesses, based on interactions involving light dark matter and/or neutrinos. The novelty of our proposal lies in the utilization of a photon arising from 2-to-3 scattering processes between a nucleus/nucleon and a neutrino and/or dark matter via exchanges of light mediators. We find that viable regions exist in the coupling and mass parameter space of the mediators and light dark matter that can simultaneously explain the observed excesses and remain consistent with current experimental constraints. We further highlight that these scenarios can be tested with upcoming data from various ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>Kaon and Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Drell-Levy-Yan relation is employed to obtain pion and kaon elementary fragmentation functions (EFFs) from the hadron-scale parton distribution functions (DFs) of these mesons. Two different DF sets are used: that calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) and the other expressing results obtained using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs). Thus determined, the EFFs serve as driving terms in a coupled set of hadron cascade equations, whose solution yields the complete array of hadron-scale fragmentation functions (FFs) for pion and kaon production in high energy reactions. After evolution to scales typical of experiments, the SCI and CSM FF predictions are seen to be in semiquantitative agreement. Importantly, they conform with a range of physical expectations for FF behaviour on the endpoint domains $z\simeq 0, 1$, e.g., nonsinglet FFs vanish at $z=0$ and singlet FFs diverge faster than $1/z$. Predictions for hadron multiplicities in jets are also delivered. They reveal SU$(3)$ symmetry breaking in the charged-kaon/neutral-kaon multiplicity ratio, whose size diminishes with increasing reaction energy, and show that, with increasing energy, the pion/kaon ratio in $e^+ e^- \to h X$ diminishes to a value that is independent of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Symmetric Neutrino Mass Model without Scalar Bi-doublet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a left-right symmetric model with an $SU(2)_L$ and an $SU(2)_R$ scalar doublet but without the scalar bidoublet. The charged fermion masses in this model are generated via a universal seesaw mechanism. We add a set of three gauge singlet neutral fermions with Majorana masses of the order of a TeV. The masses for the left-handed neutrinos are naturally small in this model because they occur only at one-loop and are generated through a see-saw mechanism. By an appropriate choice of the Yukawa couplings of the $SU(2)_L$ doublet and the masses of the gauge singlet fermions, it is possible to implement resonant leptogenesis at TeV scale. The right-handed sector of the model, through appropriate values of the Yukawa couplings of the $SU(2)_R$ doublet, leads to a warm dark matter candidate in the lightest right-handed neutrino with a mass of a few keV and an observable effective electron mass for neutrinoless double beta decay $m_{\beta \beta}$.</description>

      <title>Asteroid-mass soliton as the dark matter-baryon coincidence solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have largely ruled out macroscopic dark matter across a wide range of masses, leaving an experimentally interesting window in the asteroid-mass region. Yet, theoretical motivation for this mass window is still insufficient. We initiate a new pattern of nontopological solitons, where a charge asymmetry is inherited from baryogenesis and later trapped by a first-order phase transition. This pattern makes the solitons coincident dark matter that provides new explanations for the coincidence problem between baryon and dark matter energy densities. Coincident soliton dark matter miraculously resides in the asteroid-mass window if strong gravitational waves reach the detection region, providing a strong motivation for macroscopic dark matter within this window. For the first time, we provide a realistic neutrino-ball scenario that solves the baryon asymmetry, dark matter, and neutrino mass problems. New particles are below the electroweak scale, and observable signals are correlated, including lensing effects, gravitational waves, and soliton evaporation/collision.</description>

      <title>Phase Boundary of Nuclear Matter in Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear matter with a strong magnetic field is prevalent inside neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions. In a sufficiently large magnetic field the ground state is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons of the neutral pion field, or a domain-wall Skyrmion phase in which Skyrmions emerge inside the chiral solitons. In the region of large chemical potential and a magnetic field lower than its critical value for CSL, a Skyrmion crystal is expected to take up the ground state based on the chiral perturbation theory at the next leading order. We determine the phase boundary between such a Skyrmion crystal and the QCD vacuum. There was a conjecture that a magnetic field deforms the Skyrmion into a pancake shape whose boundary is a superconducting ring of charged pions. In contrast, through the exact Skyrmion solution, we find that the pancake conjecture holds approximately in a strong magnetic field, but fails for a weak one. We also validate that a Skyrmion would shrink to null without the Skyrme term, although Derrick's scaling law is modified by a background magnetic field, and the stability at the leading order is not ruled out in theory.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic and parametric resonances for massive particle production in an intense plane wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of an intensive plane wave of a massless or light field $\phi$ in a trilinear scalar model $g\phi\chi^2$ due to the resonant production of massive $\chi$ particles in a perturbatively forbidden regime. We apply two methods: first, we solve the Heisenberg equation for the quantum amplitudes of the field $\chi$ in an external plane wave background, generalizing the solution of A.Arza. Second, for the light but massive $\phi$ we perform the relativistic boost to the rest frame of $\phi$, reducing the problem to the stability of the thoroughly investigated massive condensate. It turns out that the stability properties are significantly different for the cases of massless and light fields. In the first case, one should adopt the Heisenberg equation approach, since the alternative method cannot provide a comprehensive outcome. In the second case, the use of the Mathieu equation provides a more accurate solution, while for the massless case, this approach is not applicable.</description>

      <title>Possible bound states in the triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observations of fully-charm tetraquark states in the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS experiments suggested the existence of the hadron molecule of two-charmonium states, which may also imply the bound states in the three-charmonium systems. In this work, we study the possible bound states in the triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ systems with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$, respectively. In QCD sum rules, we calculate the two-point correlation functions and spectral functions up to the dimension four gluon condensate. We use the iterative dispersion relation approach to deal with the five-loop banana integrals, which significantly improves the computational efficiency. Our results show that the masses of triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ states below the corresponding mass thresholds, supporting the existence of such three-body bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic filaments form the backbone of the cosmic web, yet their properties and evolution remain uncertain. Using the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the dark matter density profiles in filaments and their implications for dark matter decay signals. We show that GeV-scale dark matter particles decaying into electron-positron pairs can produce detectable radio synchrotron emission. By leveraging stacked filament radio data, we place stringent constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime, improving existing limits by up to two orders of magnitude for strong filamentary magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Can the strong interactions between hadrons be determined using femtoscopy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, femtoscopic measurements from heavy-ion collisions have become a popular tool to investigate the strong interactions between hadrons. The key observables measured in such experiments are the two-hadron momentum correlations, which depend on the production mechanism of hadron pairs and the final-state interactions. Given the complexity of ultra-relativistic collision experiments, the source term describing the production mechanism can only be modeled phenomenologically based on numerous assumptions. The commonly employed approach for analyzing femtoscopic data relies on the Koonin-Pratt formula, which relates the measured correlation functions with the relative wave function of an outgoing hadron pair and a source term that is assumed to be universal. Here, we critically examine this universality assumption and show that for strongly interacting particles such as nucleons, the interpretation of femtoscopic measurements suffers from a potentially large intrinsic uncertainty. We also comment on the ongoing efforts to explore three-body interactions using this experimental technique.</description>

      <title>Kaon radiative leptonic decay rates from lattice QCD simulations at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the radiative leptonic decay rates of the kaon, improving upon our previous work, arXiv:2006.05358. Our analysis uses gauge ensembles generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with $N_{f} = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of Wilson-clover twisted mass fermions. For the first time, we go beyond the electroquenched approximation by including quark-disconnected contributions. Several key improvements have been implemented: (i) the simulations are now performed directly at physical light- and strange-quark masses, (ii) finite-size effects are carefully investigated using lattices with spatial extents ranging from $L \simeq 3.8\,\mathrm{fm}$ to $L \simeq 7.7\,\mathrm{fm}$, and (iii) the continuum extrapolation is based on three lattice spacings in the range $a \in [0.08, 0.058]\,\mathrm{fm}$. As a result of the high-precision determination of the relevant correlation functions, we reduce the uncertainties on both the axial and vector form factors by nearly a factor of two compared to our previous analysis. When compared to experimental measurements in the electron channel ($K^- \to e^- \bar{\nu}_e \gamma$), our results show a tension -- at the level of $2.6$ standard deviations -- with respect to KLOE data. On the other hand, they are compatible with measurements from the E36 Collaboration at J-PARC. In the muonic decay channel ($K^- \to \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu \gamma$), we confirm the tensions, already observed in our previous study, between lattice QCD predictions and ISTRA+ and OKA data, which are both primarily sensitive to the value of the negative-helicity form factor $F^{-}$.</description>

Abstract: We present the historical antecedents to the field of relativistic heavy ion physics, beginning with early attempts to model the strong interaction and ending with the endorsement of a relativistic heavy ion collider in the 1983 U.S. Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science. Particular attention is paid to two major themes: 1) A program to study high density states of nuclear matter emerging from the 1974 Bear Mountain conference and 2) Efforts to understand the predictions of QCD for matter at high densities and/or temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss sensitivities to lepton flavor violating (and conserving) interactions at future muon colliders, especially at $\mu^+\mu^+$ colliders. Compared with the searches for rare decays of $\mu$ and $\tau$, we find that the TeV-scale future colliders have better sensitivities depending on the pattern of hierarchy in the flavor mixings. As an example, we study the case with the type-II seesaw model, where the flavor mixing parameters have direct relation to the neutrino mass matrix. At a $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collider, the number of events of the $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to \mu^+ \tau^+$ process can be larger than $\mathcal{O}(100)$ with the center of mass energy $\sqrt s = 2$ TeV, and with an integrated luminosity ${\cal L} = 1$ ab$^{-1}$, while satisfying bounds from rare decays of $\mu$ and $\tau$. We discuss impacts of the overall mass scale of neutrinos as well as CP violating phases to the number of expected events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Bulk Fields: No-Go Conjectures for Braneworld Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work establishes a series of no-go conjectures that impose rigorous constraints on the localization of bulk fields in braneworld scenarios, specifically affecting gauge and spinor fields within five-dimensional spacetimes. Our approach differs from traditional methods as it does not rely on specific equations of motion, making our results broadly applicable across various braneworld models. These no-go conditions reveal fundamental limitations in field localization, challenging the feasibility of embedding fields on the brane. For instance, our analysis demonstrates that existing models fail to achieve consistent localization for gauge and spinor fields. Additionally, one of our conditions indicates that the effective Lagrangian on the brane cannot exhibit conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson production at $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Higgs boson production at $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders at high energy. Since both initial-state particles are positively charged, there is no $W$ boson fusion at the leading order, as it requires a $W^+ W^-$ pair. However, we find that the cross section of the higher-order, $\gamma$- and $Z$-mediated $W$ boson fusion process is large at high center-of-mass energies $\sqrt s$, growing as $(\log s)^3$. This is in contrast to the $\log s$ behavior of the leading-order $W$ boson fusion. Thus, even though it is a higher-order process, the rate of Higgs boson production for 10 TeV energies at $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders with polarized beams can be as high as about half of the one at $\mu^+ \mu^-$ colliders, assuming the same integrated luminosity. To calculate the cross section of this process accurately, we carefully treat the collinear emission of the photon in the intermediate state. The thereby obtained large cross section furthermore shows the significance of Higgs production with an extra $W$ boson in the final state also at $\mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>Semi-automatic Calculations of Multi-loop Feynman Amplitudes with AmpRed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Mathematica package AmpRed for the semi-automatic calculations of multi-loop Feynman amplitudes with high efficiency and precision. AmpRed implements the methods of integration by parts and differential equations in the Feynman-parameter representation. It allows for the calculations of general parametric integrals (which may not have momentum-space correspondences). Various user-friendly tools for multi-loop calculations, such as those to construct and solve differential equations for Feynman integrals, are provided. It can also deal with tensor algebras in non-relativistic field theories. Interfaces to some packages, like QGRAF and FORM, are also provided.</description>

      <title>Probing the decay $A^0\to h^0 Z^{(*)}$ in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models in the inverted hierarchy scenario at the Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches are being carried out at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the decay of the CP-odd scalar ($A^0$) in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs) with Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) in the channel $A^0\to h^0 Z$, where $h^0$ is either the discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson or is an undiscovered CP-even scalar with a mass below 125 GeV. The latter possibility is called the "inverted hierarchy scenario" (IH) and would provide the opportunity of simultaneous discovery of two scalars. In both searches the selection cuts are optimised for the case of an on-shell $Z$ boson. For the case of the $Z$ boson being off-shell (denoted by $Z^*$, for which $m_{A^0} - m_{h^0}&lt;m_Z$) no limits are set on the relevant 2HDM parameters from this process. It is known that the decay $A^0\to h^0 Z^*$ can have a large branching ratio (BR) in 2HDMs (especially in the Type I structure). In the context of the IH scenario and developing our previous work, we calculate the signal cross section $\sigma(gg\to A^0)\times {\rm BR}(A^0\to h^0Z^{(*)})\times {\rm BR}(h^0\to b\overline b,\tau\overline \tau)$ in the four types of 2HDMs with NFC. We also suggest some selection cuts that could provide sensitivity to $A^0\to h^0 Z^*$ in the IH scenario.</description>

      <title>On the Schwinger effect during axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair-creation of charged particles in a strong gauge-field background - the renowned Schwinger effect - can strongly alter the efficiency of gauge-field production during axion inflation. It is therefore crucial to have a clear understanding and proper description of this phenomenon to obtain reliable predictions for the physical observables in this model. In the present work, we revisit the problem of Schwinger pair production during axion inflation in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields and improve on the state of the art in two ways: (i) taking into account that the electric- and magnetic-field three-vectors are in general not collinear, we derive the vector decomposition of the Schwinger-induced current in terms of these fields and determine the corresponding effective electric and magnetic conductivities; (ii) by identifying the physical momentum scale associated with the pair-creation process, we incorporate Schwinger damping of the gauge field in a scale-dependent fashion in the relevant equations of motion. Implementing this new description in the framework of the gradient-expansion formalism, we obtain numerical results in a benchmark scenario of axion inflation and perform a comprehensive comparison with earlier results in the literature. In some cases, the resulting energy densities of the produced gauge fields differ from the old results by more than one order of magnitude, which reflects the importance of taking the new effects into account.</description>

      <title>Interference effects in resonant di-Higgs production at the LHC in the Higgs singlet extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interference effects are well founded from the quantum mechanical viewpoint and in principle cannot be ignored in realistic studies of New Physics scenarios. In this work, we investigate the size of interference effects between resonant and non-resonant contributions to di-Higgs production in the singlet extension of the Standard Model, where the additional heavy scalar provides a resonant channel. We find these interference contributions to have a non-negligible effect on the cross-sections and differential distributions. In order to allow for a computationally efficient treatment of these effects via reweighting, we introduce a new tool utilising a matrix-element reweighting method: HHReweighter. In addition to the broadly used di-Higgs invariant mass $m_{hh}$, we analyse the sensitivity to the interference terms for other kinematic variables, such as the Higgs boson transverse momentum, and find that these also can be sensitive to interference effects. Furthermore, we provide updates on the latest experimental and theoretical limits on the parameter space of the real singlet extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>General Signals for Charged Lepton Flavor Violating Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the most general phenomenology of charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) decays of muon and tau leptons to the three body final states $(\bar{e}ee, \bar{\mu}\mu\mu, \bar{e}\mu\mu, \bar{\mu}\mu e,\bar{\mu}ee, \bar{e}e\mu)$. By constructing a complete basis of operators at each dimension, we derive the most general amplitudes for these decay processes. By considering constraints from unitarity and LEP, we show that operators of mass dimension 6 and 7 are the most likely to be observed in next generation experiments. Focusing on these dimensions, we compute the results of unpolarized (spin-averaged) decays parameterized in terms of the invariant masses of the daughter particles. We also compute the differential decay rates for polarized decays, in anticipation of the experimental search Mu3e, which expects to have a muon beam with $\sim 90\%$ polarization, and the Chiral Belle proposal, which aims to have a $70\%$ polarized electron beam. To determine the extent to which the operators may be distinguished experimentally, we plot the differential distributions for each operator, showing that they leave only a few possible degenerate explanations. Through a statistical analysis, we estimate the number of events needed to break the degeneracies using the angular information. These results are adapted to treat $\ell\to \ell' \nu \bar{\nu}$, where the angular distribution of the outgoing charged lepton has enhanced distinguishing power. With many Standard Model extensions predicting these CLFV decays, these results will better enable upcoming searches to identify and/or constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Properties of the tensor state $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and decays of the exotic tensor meson $T$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are explored in the context of the diquark-antidiquark model. We treat it as a state built of axial-vector diquark $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }c$ and antidiquark $\overline{b}\gamma _{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this tetraquark are extracted from two-point sum rules. Our result for $m=(12.70 \pm 0.09)~\mathrm{GeV}$ proves that $T$ is unstable against strong dissociations to two-meson final states. Its dominant decay channels are processes $T \to J/\psi \Upsilon $, $ \eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, and $B_{c}^{(\ast) +}B_{c}^{(\ast) -}$. Kinematically allowed transformations of $T$ include also decays $T\rightarrow D^{(\ast )+}D^{(\ast )-}$ and $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, which are generated by $b\overline{b}$ annihilation inside of $T$. The full width of $ T $ is estimated by considering all of these channels. Their partial widths are calculated by invoking methods of three-point sum rule approach which are required to evaluate strong couplings at corresponding tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions for the mass and width $ \Gamma_{T}=(117.4 \pm 15.9)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor state $T$ provide useful information for experimental studies of fully heavy four-quark exotic structures.</description>

Abstract: A flavor-unified theory based on the simple Lie algebra of ${\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}}(8)$ was previously proposed to generate the observed Standard Model quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern due to their non-universal symmetry properties. A level-$1$ affine Lie algebra of $\widehat{ \mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u} }(8)_{ k_U =1}$ with the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric extension is found to unify three gauge couplings through the maximally symmetry breaking pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\textit{complete}$ parameter space of a bulk axion in flat and warped extra spacetime dimensions. We characterize in detail the regimes where no single KK mode is produced along the canonical QCD axion line, and instead, it is maximally deviated along with several other axions that constitute a multiple solution to the strong CP problem. In both flat and Randall-Sundrum scenarios, and assuming that all Peccei-Quinn breaking comes from QCD, we find that these solutions are however subject to tight phenomenological constraints. In light of these results, we expect that only KK canonical patterns (with the zero-mode close to the standard QCD line) can emerge from a bulk axion in one or more extra spacetime dimensions. As a byproduct, we generalize the axions eigenvalue and eigenvector equations for an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions and compactifications.</description>

Abstract: Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) provide a compelling extension to the Standard Model, addressing the neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter problems. We perform a model-independent collider study, decoupling the active-sterile mixing angle ($V$) from the Yukawa coupling ($y$), and explore sensitivities at the HL-LHC for prompt and displaced decays. We also consider the possibility of HNLs being long-lived particles decaying in far detectors as FASER. In addition, we study the expected reach at FCC-ee for the prompt and displaced cases. For zero mixing, FCC-ee and HL-LHC sensitivities to $y$ are comparable, with Higgs width measurements imposing the strongest constraints. With non-zero mixing, sensitivities are dominated by $V$, significantly constraining parameter space. This work highlights the importance of precision Higgs studies and displaced searches in probing HNLs at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we found the dipole-nucleus scattering amplitude at high energies by summing large Pomeron loops. It turns out that the energy dependence of this amplitude is the same as for dipole-dipole scattering. It means that the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation, which has been derived to describe this scattering, can be trusted only in the limited range of energies: $z \,\leq\, \sqrt{2\,\kappa\,C}A^{1/6} $</description>

Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the theory of resonances, focusing specifically on the spectrum of excited strongly interacting particles. After providing historical context starting from the atomic theory, we summarize the status of theoretical and experimental research. We discuss then the methodology to determine universal resonance parameter through the analytical properties of the transition amplitudes. For this, the main aspects of the $S$-matrix theory are introduced including some explicit calculations in simplified cases. In the last section, we summarize several frequently used amplitude types also making a connection to Effective Field Theories, as well as provide first glimpse into some more advanced applications to further resonance properties.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on a recently proposed geometric framework for scalar effective field theories. Starting from the action, a metric can be identified that enables the construction of geometric quantities on the associated functional manifold. These objects transform covariantly under general field redefinitions that relate different operator bases, including those involving derivatives. We present a novel geometric formula for the amplitudes of the theory, where the vertices in Feynman diagrams are replaced by their geometrized counterparts. This makes the on-shell covariance of amplitudes manifest, providing the link between functional geometry and effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of finite-volume effect on hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon g-2</title>

Abstract: Low-energy spectrum relevant to the lattice calculation of hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment a_\mu is dominantly given by two-pion states satisfying L\"uscher's finite-volume quantization condition. Finite-volume effects from those states may exhibit power-law dependence on the volume, contrary to an exponential suppression as suggested by chiral effective theory. Employing the finite-volume state decomposition of Euclidean correlators, we systematically investigate the volume dependence and identify the different volume scalings depending on the region. Using phenomenological inputs for \pi \pi phase shift and time-like pion form factor, we obtain an estimate for the finite-volume effects on a_\mu, which is consistent with previous works. Numerical results are given for the ``window'' observables of a_\mu.</description>

      <title>Computing the UV-finite electromagnetic corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization in the muon $(g-2)$ from lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: In order to reach a precision of $0.2\%$ on the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, such that the full Standard-Model prediction matches in precision the direct experimental measurement, it is crucial to include the leading, O($\alpha$) electromagnetic corrections to HVP. In this work, we determine an important contribution to the latter from a diagram comprised of two two-point quark-loops, connected by the internal photon and gluons. This ultraviolet-finite correction is calculated from lattice QCD using a coordinate-space formalism, where photons are treated in the continuum and infinite volume. Our result amounts to a $(-0.89\pm 0.18)\%$ correction to the leading-order HVP contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$. To overcome the worsening statistical noise at large distances, our analysis is combined with phenomenological models featuring light pseudoscalar mesons with masses below 1 GeV. In particular, our data show a very steep mass dependence as dictated by the charged pion loop. Similarly, the other diagrams appearing in the O$(\alpha)$-corrections to the HVP with the internal photon connecting two separate quark loops are also ultraviolet-finite and can be computed with the same formalism.</description>

      <title>Robustness of dark energy phenomenology across different parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929</link>

Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter models: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Has DESI detected exponential quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04226</link>

Abstract: The new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results have strengthened the possibility that dark energy is dynamical, i.e., it has evolved over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological observations, to constrain the model's parameters and to compare its goodness of fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and $\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$ is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and $0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively, which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain $\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive $\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, as well as a few caveats to our results.</description>
