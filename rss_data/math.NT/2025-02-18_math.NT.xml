      <title>Smooth Numbers in Short Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( X \geq y \geq 2 \), and let \( u = \frac{\log X}{\log y} \). We say a number is \textit{$y$-smooth} if all of its prime factors are less than or equal to \( y \). In this paper, we study the distribution of $y$-smooth numbers in short intervals. In particular, for \( y \geq \exp\left( (\log X)^{2/3 + \epsilon} \right) \), we show that the interval \( [x, x+h] \) contains a $y$-smooth number for almost all \( x \in [X, 2X] \), provided \( h \geq \exp\left( (1 + \epsilon) \left( \frac{11}{8} u \log u + 4 \log \log X \right) \right) \), and \( X \) is sufficiently large depending on \( \epsilon \). This result improves upon an earlier result by Matom\"aki. Additionally, we provide the corresponding ``all intervals" type result.</description>

      <title>Sur une conjecture de Schinzel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a conjecture of Schinzel on the intersection of a subvariety of codimension at least 2 in a power of the multiplicative group with a torus of dimension 1. The proof rests on a geometric B\'ezout's theorem of P. Philippon and on lower bounds for the height of the first author, S. David and E. Viada. It gives for the first time an explicit result, depending on the height and degree of the variety. It is inspired on a similar statement on products of elliptic curves, by S. Checcoli, F. Veneziano and E. Viada.</description>

      <title>On The Image of Automorphic Galois Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study extra-twists for automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ and use them to give a precise description of the image of the Galois representations associated with regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_3$ over totally real fields. We also formulate a conjecture for the $\mathrm{GL}_n$-case and show how it follows from some standard conjectures in the Langlands program. Finally, assuming the existence of a motive associated with the representation, we study the relation of our constructions with the Mumford-Tate group.</description>

      <title>Fractal counterparts of density combinatorics theorems in continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a bridge from density combinatorics to dimension theory of continued fractions. We establish a fractal transference principle that transfers common properties of subsets of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density to properties of subsets of irrationals in $(0,1)$ for which the set $\{a_n(x)\colon n\in\mathbb N\}$ of partial quotients induces an injection $n\in\mathbb N\mapsto a_n(x)\in\mathbb N$. Let $(*)$ be a certain property that holds for any subset of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density. The principle asserts that for any subset $S$ of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density, there exists a set $E_S$ of Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ such that the set $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}\bigcap_{x\in E_S}\{a_n(x)\}\cap S$ has the same upper density as that of $S$, and thus inherits property $(*)$. Examples of $(*)$ include the existence of arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths and the existence of arbitrary polynomial progressions, known as Szemer\'edi's and Bergelson-Leibman's theorems respectively. In the same spirit, we establish a relativized version of the principle applicable to the primes, to the primes of the form $y^2+z^2+1$, to the sets given by the Piatetski-Shapiro sequences.</description>

      <title>Refined effective bounds for Bloch-Kato Selmer groups associated to hyperelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop refined methods to effectively bound the dimension of Bloch-Kato Selmer groups associated to the higher Chow group $\mathrm{CH}^2(J,1)$, where $J$ is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve $X$. This extends the recent work of Dogra on explicit $2$-descent for these Selmer groups to include cases where $X$ does not have a rational Weierstrass point. Additionally, we develop methods for obtaining sharper dimension bounds under the assumption that $X$ has good ordinary reduction at $2$. As a consequence, we establish new criteria for deducing finiteness of the depth $2$ Chabauty-Kim set $X(\mathbb{Q}_2)_2$, and demonstrate the efficacy of these criteria on curves from the LMFDB.</description>

      <title>Pythagoras numbers for infinite algebraic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Pythagoras number of the ring of integers of the compositum of all real quadratic fields is infinite. The same holds for certain infinite totally real cyclotomic fields. In contrast, we construct infinite degree totally real algebraic fields whose rings of integers have finite Pythagoras numbers, namely, one, two, three, and at least four.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Algorithms for the Representation of integers by Binary Quadratic forms: Reduction to Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the quadratic Diophantine equation $x^2 + d y^2 = m$, where $d$ and $m$ are positive integers, Cornacchia's algorithm efficiently finds integer solutions when the factorization of $m$ is known. However, when $m$ is highly composite, i.e. has too many distinct prime factors, the algorithm's running time suddenly becomes exponentially large in the input size. In this paper, we demonstrate that solving the aforementioned Diophantine equation can be reduced to an instance of the subset sum problem, a well known weakly NP-complete problem in complexity theory. Leveraging this reduction, we propose multiple algorithms that solve this problem, given the factorization of $m$, based on different cases depending on $d$ and $m$. Particularly, one of our algorithms finds a solution in polynomial time when $d=\mathrm{polylog}(m)$, while the other achieves a quadratic speedup over Cornacchia's algorithm in the generic case. Recently, the problem of representing $m$ in this form has gained significant attention, particularly in applications to elliptic curves and isogeny-based cryptography where this algorithm is central to solving norm form equations.</description>

      <title>Prime numbers and dynamics of the polynomial $x^2 - 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. By $P(n)$ we denote the set of all prime divisors of the integers in the sequence $n, n^2-1, (n^2-1)^2-1, \dots$. We ask whether the set $P(n)$ determines $n$ uniquely under the assumption that $n \neq m^2-1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. This problem originates in the structure theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that the sets $P(n)$ generate infinitely many equivalence classes of positive integers under the equivalence relation $n_1 \sim n_2 \iff P(n_1) = P(n_2)$. We also prove that the sets $P(n)$ separate all positive integers up to $2^{29}$, and we provide some heuristics on why the answer to our question should be positive.</description>

      <title>On the average least negative Hecke eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the first sign change of Hecke eigenvalues of classical newforms has a finite mean, which we also compute. We distinguish between the first negative prime Hecke eigenvalue, and the first negative Hecke eigenvalue. This problem can be considered to be an analogue of the least quadratic non-residue problem, of which the average was explored by Erd\H{o}s in 1961. In fact, the average least negative prime Hecke eigenvalue has the same value as the average least quadratic non-residue, under GRH. To compute these averages, we develop large sieve inequalities that are uniform in both the weight and level aspect.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic of matrices over rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The book is devoted to investigation of arithmetic of the matrix rings over certain classes of commutative finitely generated principal ideals do- mains. We mainly concentrate on constructing of the matrix factorization theory. We reveal a close relationship between the matrix factorization and specific properties of subgroups of the complete linear group and the special normal form of matrices with respect to unilateral equivalence. The properties of matrices over rings of stable range 1.5 are thoroughly studied.
  The book is intended for experts in the ring theory and linear algebra, senior and post-graduate students.</description>

      <title>Estimates for Betti numbers and relative Hermite-Minkowski theorem for perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove estimates for the Betti numbers of constructible sheaves in characteristic p&gt;0 depending only on their rank, stratification and wild ramification. In particular, given a smooth proper variety of dimension n over an algebraically closed field and a divisor D of X, for every $0\leq i \leq n$, there is a polynomial $P_i$ of degree $\max \{i,2n-i\}$ such that the i-th Betti number of any rank r local system L on X-D is smaller than $P_i(lc_D(L))\cdot r$ where $lc_D(L)$ is the highest logarithmic conductor of L at the generic points of D. As application, we show that the Betti numbers of the inverse and higher direct images of a local system are controlled by the rank and the highest logarithmic conductor. We also reprove Deligne's finiteness for simple $\ell$-adic local systems with bounded rank and ramification on a smooth variety over a finite field and extend it in two different directions. In particular, perverse sheaves over arbitrary singular schemes are allowed and the bounds we obtain are uniform in algebraic families and do not depend on $\ell$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove a semi-continuity property for both conductor divisors and logarithmic conductor divisors for \'etale sheaves on higher relative dimensions in a geometric situation. It generalizes a semi-continuity result for conductors of \'etale sheaves on relative curves to higher relative dimensions, and it can be considered as a higher dimensional $\ell$-adic analogy of Andr\'e's result on the semi-continuity of Poincar\'e-Katz ranks of meromorphic connections on smooth relative curves.</description>

      <title>How did Fermat discover his theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1640 Pierre de Fermat discovered his theorem that if $p$ is prime and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1}-1$ is divisible by $p$; or, as we write today, $a^{p-1}\equiv1\pmod{p}$. This is perhaps the first and the most important surprising property ever discovered about primes. There is little in number theory that is not dependent on it or intertwined with it, and its significance is amply demonstrated by the fact that today, almost four centuries later, Fermat's theorem provides the mathematical foundation for the RSA cryptosystem, which is still central to society's communications security even after several decades serving as its heart.
  Fermat's theorem is totally unexpected and truly astonishing. So why and how did he discover it? We know that Fermat was studying perfect numbers from classical Greek mathematics. But exactly how did that lead to his discovery? The secret lies in patterns in prime factorizations of Mersenne numbers, and Fermat's letters reveal hints of his path. We can reconstruct details of how Mersenne numbers led to Fermat's discoveries.</description>

      <title>Curves on Compact Arithmetic Quotients of Hyperbolic 2-ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the simplest type of compact arithmetic quotients of the hyperbolic 2-ball $\mathbb{B}^2$, which has a moduli interpretation for certain types of abelian varieties of dimension 6 with $\mathcal{O}_F$-endomorphism, where $F$ is a CM extension of a real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$. Under mild assumption, we prove that for any fixed $g$, when the defining discriminant $D$ is large, there will be no complex curves of genus $g$ on this type of arithmetic quotients. The proof uses the technique of volume estimates, which requires us to understand the distribution of special subvarieties and the geometry near quotient and cusp singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the formalism of Cox rings and universal torsors, we prove a decomposition of the Grothendieck motive of the moduli space of morphisms from an arbitrary smooth projective curve to a Mori Dream Space (MDS).
  For the simplest cases of MDS, that of toric varieties, we use this decomposition to prove an instance of the motivic Batyrev--Manin--Peyre principle for curves satisfying tangency conditions with respect to the boundary divisors, often called Campana curves.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons invariants of hyperbolic three-manifolds, mixed Tate motives, and motivic path torsor of augmented character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any complete hyperbolic three-manifold of finite volume, we construct a mixed Tate motive defined over the invariant trace field whose image under Beilinson regulator equals the PSL2(C)-Chern-Simons invariant, thus equals the complex volume of the manifold, up to constant. Further, we show that when M has single torus boundary, under some assumption on asymptotic behaviour of the Chern-Simons invariant near an ideal point, its Hodge realization is a quotient of the mixed Hodge structure on the path torsor of the smooth locus of the canonical curve component of the augmented character variety of the three-manifold between a geometric point (giving the complete hyperbolic structure) and some tangential base point at an ideal point whose existence is asserted by the assumption. We explain its motivic implication. In the appendix, we verify some cases of the assumption. The theory developed here is parallel to the motivic theory of polylogarithms.</description>

Abstract: The divisor graph is the non oriented graph whose vertices are the positive integers, and edges are the {a,b} such that a divides b or b divides a. Let F(x,y) be the maximum number of integers&lt;= x belonging in one of y pairwise disjoint simple path of the restriction of the divisor graph to integers &lt;= x. Our main result is the following. There exist two real numbers K &gt;c&gt;0 such that for every x and y with x&gt;=2y&gt;=2 , we have cx / log(x/y) &lt;= F(x,y) &lt;= Kx / log(x/y). It answers a question of Erd\"os.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Goldbach's Strong Conjecture by Using Semi-Continuous Model of Even Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.13230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit and analytic proof for still unproven Goldbach's strong conjecture. To derive this proof, we first define a heuristic model for representing even numbers called Semi-continuous Model for Even Numbers or briefly S.C.E Model, and then we employ this model along with using the inequality
  \begin{center}
  $\dfrac{x}{\ln x}\leq_{x\geq 17}\pi(x)\leq_{x&gt;1}1.2251\dfrac{x}{\ln x}$,
  \end{center}
  where $\pi(x)$ denotes the number of all primes smaller than and equal to $x$, and is presented by Pierre Dusart in his paper [P. Dusart, \textit{Explicit estimates of some functions over primes}, Ramanujan J. \textbf{45} (2016), No. 1, 227--251].
  On the one hand, this proof is given for all even numbers $E\geq22864$. On the other hand, since the assertion of Goldbach's strong conjecture is easy to verify for all even numbers $4\leq E&lt;22864$, we turn this conjecture into a theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10111v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet Heuristics gives a prediction of the distribution of $\operatorname{Cl}_K[p^\infty]$ whne $K$ runs over $\Gamma$-fields and $p\nmid|\Gamma|$. In this paper, we prove several results on the distribution of ideal class groups for some $p||\Gamma|$, and show that the behaviour is qualitatively different than what is predicted by the heuristics when $p\nmid|\Gamma|$.We do this by using genus theory and the invariant part of the class group to investigate the algebraic structure of the class group. For general number fields, our result is conditional on a natural conjecture on counting fields. For abelian or $D_4$-fields, our result is unconditional.</description>

      <title>Hecke Actions on Loops and Periods of Iterated Shimura Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the classical Hecke correspondences T_N, N&gt;0, act on the free abelian groups generated by the conjugacy classes of the modular group SL_2(Z) and the conjugacy classes of its profinite completion. We show that this action induces a dual action on the ring of class functions of a certain relative unipotent completion of the modular group. This ring contains all iterated integrals of modular forms that are constant on conjugacy classes. It possesses a natural mixed Hodge structure and, after tensoring with Q_ell$, a natural action of the absolute Galois group. Each Hecke operator preserves this mixed Hodge structure and commutes with the action of the absolute Galois group. Unlike in the classical case, the algebra generated by these Hecke operators is not commutative. The appendix by Pham Tiep is not included. It can be found at arXiv:2303.02807.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any prime $p$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we prove that for any sufficiently large positive odd integer $s$ at least $(c_p-\varepsilon) \sqrt{\frac{s}{\log s}}$ of the $p$-adic zeta values $\zeta_p(3),\zeta_p(5),\dots,\zeta_p(s)$ are irrational. The constant $c_p$ is positive and does only depend on $p$. This result establishes a $p$-adic version of the elimination technique used by Fischler--Sprang--Zudilin and Lai--Yu to prove a similar result on classical zeta values. The main difficulty consists in proving the non-vanishing of the resulting linear forms. We overcome this problem by using a new irrationality criterion.</description>

Abstract: We consider the set $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{Z}; H)$ of $n\times n$-matrices with integer elements of size at most $H$ and obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of distinct irreducible characteristic polynomials which correspond to these matrices and thus on the number of distinct eigenvalues of these matrices. In particular, we improve some results of A.~Abrams, Z.~Landau, J.~Pommersheim and N.~Srivastava (2022).</description>

      <title>Computing Euler factors of genus 2 curves at odd primes of almost good reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm to compute the Euler factor of a genus 2 curve C/Q at an odd prime p that is of bad reduction for C but of good reduction for the Jacobian of C (a prime of ``almost good'' reduction). Our approach is based on the theory of cluster pictures introduced by Dokchitser, Dokchitser, Maistret, and Morgan, which allows us to reduce the problem to a short, explicit computation over Z and Fp, followed by a point-counting computation on two elliptic curves over Fp, or a single elliptic curve over Fp^2. A key feature of our approach is that we avoid the need to compute a regular model for C. This allows us to efficiently compute many examples that are infeasible to handle using the algorithms currently available in computer algebra systems such as Magma and Pari/GP.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, and let $f(x)\in\mathcal{O}_K[x]$ be a monic, irreducible polynomial. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the critical points of $f(x)$ for the iterates of $f(x)$ to be monogenic polynomials. More generally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the backwards orbits of elements of $\mathcal{O}_K$ under $f(x)$ to be monogenerators. We apply our criteria to construct novel examples of dynamically monogenic polynomials, yielding infinite towers of monogenic number fields with the backward orbit of one monogenerator giving a monogenerator at the next level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to explore the Euler system of Beilinson--Kato elements in families passing through the critical $p$-stabilization of an Eisenstein series attached to two Dirichlet characters $(\psi,\tau)$. In this context, we establish an explicit connection with the system of circular units, utilizing suitable factorization formulas in a situation where several of the $p$-adic $L$-functions vanish. In that regard, our main results may be seen as an Euler system incarnation of the factorization formula of Bella\"iche and Dasgupta. One of the most significant aspects is that, depending on the parity of $\psi$ and $\tau$, different phenomena arise; while some can be addressed with our methods, others pose new questions. Finally, we discuss analogous results in the framework of Beilinson--Flach classes.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for all $n\geq 1$ there exists a number between $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$ with at most 4 prime factors. This is the first result of this kind that holds for every $n\geq 1$ rather than just sufficiently large $n$. Our approach relies on a recent computation by Sorenson and Webster, along with an explicit version of the linear sieve. As part of our proof, we also prove an explicit version of Kuhn's weighted sieve. This is done for generic sifting sets to enhance the future applicability of our methods.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed, complete, non-Archimedean valued field of characteristic zero. We prove the non-Archimedean Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture for projective surfaces of irregularity one. More precisely, we prove that if $X/K$ is a groupless, projective surface that admits a dominant morphism an elliptic curve, then $X$ is $K$-analytically Brody hyperbolic. The main ingredient in our proof is a theorem concerning the algebraic degeneracy of non-Archimedean entire curves in projective, pseudo-groupless varieties admitting a dominant morphism to an elliptic curve.</description>

Abstract: We confirm the quasi-projective case of Saito's conjecture, namely that the cohomological characteristic classes defined by Abbes and Saito can be computed in terms of the characteristic cycles.
  We construct a cohomological characteristic class supported on the non-acyclicity locus of a separated morphism relatively to a constructible sheaf. As applications of the functorial properties of this class, we prove cohomological analogs of the Milnor formula and the conductor formula for constructible sheaves on (not necessarily smooth) varieties.</description>

      <title>Normality, Relativization, and Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normal numbers were introduced by Borel and later proven to be a weak notion of algorithmic randomness. We introduce here a natural relativization of normality based on generalized number representation systems. We explore the concepts of supernormal numbers that correspond to semicomputable relativizations, and that of highly normal numbers in terms of computable ones.
  We prove several properties of these new randomness concepts. Both supernormality and high normality generalize Borel absolute normality. Supernormality is strictly between 2-randomness and effective dimension 1, while high normality corresponds exactly to sequences of computable dimension 1 providing a more natural characterization of this class.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Spherical Witt Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a direct construction of the ring spectrum of spherical Witt vectors of a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra R as the completion of the spherical monoid algebra $\mathbb{S}[R]$ of the multiplicative monoid $(R,\cdot)$ at the ideal $I = \mathrm{fib}(\mathbb{S}[R] \to R)$. This generalizes a construction of Cuntz and Deninger. We also use this to give a description of the category of p-complete modules over the spherical Witt vectors and a universal property for spherical Witt vectors as an $\mathbb{E}_1$-ring.</description>
