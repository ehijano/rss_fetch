      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Semitotal Domination on Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given graph $G = (V, E)$, a subset of the vertices $D\subseteq V$ is called a semitotal dominating set, if $D$ is a dominating set and every vertex $v \in D$ is within distance two to another witness $v' \in D$. We want to find a semitotal dominating set of minimum cardinality. We show that the problem is $\mathrm{W}[2]$-hard on bipartite and split graphs when parameterized by the solution size $k$. On the positive side, we extend the kernelization technique of Alber, Fellows, and Niedermeier [JACM 2004] to obtain a linear kernel of size $358k$ on planar graphs. This result complements known linear kernels already known for several variants, including Total, Connected, Red-Blue, Efficient, Edge, and Independent Dominating Set.</description>

      <title>New Hardness Results for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-rank matrix completion problem asks whether a given real matrix with missing values can be completed so that the resulting matrix has low rank or is close to a low-rank matrix. The completed matrix is often required to satisfy additional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a bounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad real-world applications.
  This paper presents new $\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix completion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and any real number $\varepsilon \in [ 2^{-O(d)},\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial matrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive semi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a positive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an additive error of at most $\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to exceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2 \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra, and Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than $2$ and to $\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is constrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive semi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity assumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel notion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line digraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices.</description>

      <title>Universal Solvability for Robot Motion Planning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR) problem: given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and p robots, determine whether any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E), achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| + |E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on a and b.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Conjunctive Query Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we will survey known results on the complexity of conjunctive query evaluation in different settings, ranging from Boolean queries over counting to more complex models like enumeration and direct access. A particular focus will be on showing how different relatively recent hypotheses from complexity theory connect to query answering and allow showing that known algorithms in several cases can likely not be improved.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Model-Checking Quantum Pushdown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of model-checking quantum pushdown systems from a computational complexity point of view. We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:
  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-complete. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>

      <title>On the computation of tensor functions under tensor-tensor multiplications with linear maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the computation of both algebraic and non-algebraic tensor functions under the tensor-tensor multiplication with linear maps. In the case of algebraic tensor functions, we prove that the asymptotic exponent of both the tensor-tensor multiplication and the tensor polynomial evaluation problem under this multiplication is the same as that of the matrix multiplication, unless the linear map is injective. As for non-algebraic functions, we define the tensor geometric mean and the tensor Wasserstein mean for pseudo-positive-definite tensors under the tensor-tensor multiplication with invertible linear maps, and we show that the tensor geometric mean can be calculated by solving a specific Riccati tensor equation. Furthermore, we show that the tensor geometric mean does not satisfy the resultantal (determinantal) identity in general, which the matrix geometric mean always satisfies. Then we define a pseudo-SVD for the injective linear map case and we apply it on image data compression.</description>

      <title>How Hard is it to be a Star? Convex Geometry and the Real Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set is star-shaped if there is a point in the set that can see every other point in the set in the sense that the line-segment connecting the points lies within the set. We show that testing whether a non-empty compact smooth region is star-shaped is $\forall\mathbb{R}$-complete. Since the obvious definition of star-shapedness has logical form $\exists\forall$, this is a somewhat surprising result, based on Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}'s theorem from convex geometry; we study several related complexity classifications in the real hierarchy based on other results from convex geometry.</description>

      <title>Regular Model Checking for Systems with Effectively Regular Reachability Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular model checking is a well-established technique for the verification of regular transition systems (RTS): transition systems whose initial configurations and transition relation can be effectively encoded as regular languages. In 2008, To and Libkin studied RTSs in which the reachability relation (the reflexive and transitive closure of the transition relation) is also effectively regular, and showed that the recurrent reachability problem (whether a regular set $L$ of configurations is reached infinitely often) is polynomial in the size of RTS and the transducer for the reachability relation. We extend the work of To and Libkin by studying the decidability and complexity of verifying almost-sure reachability and recurrent reachability -- that is, whether $L$ is reachable or recurrently reachable w.p. 1. We then apply our results to the more common case in which only a regular overapproximation of the reachability relation is available. In particular, we extend recent complexity results on verifying safety using regular abstraction frameworks -- a technique recently introduced by Czerner, the authors, and Welzel-Mohr -- to liveness and almost-sure properties.</description>

      <title>Oblivious Deletion Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct deletion error-correcting codes in the oblivious model, where errors are adversarial but oblivious to the encoder's randomness. Oblivious errors bridge the gap between the adversarial and random error models, and are motivated by applications like DNA storage, where the noise is caused by hard-to-model physical phenomena, but not by an adversary.
  (1) (Explicit oblivious) We construct $t$ oblivious deletion codes, with redundancy $\sim 2t\log n$, matching the existential bound for adversarial deletions.
  (2) (List decoding implies explicit oblivious) We show that explicit list-decodable codes yield explicit oblivious deletion codes with essentially the same parameters. By a work of Guruswami and H\r{a}stad (IEEE TIT, 2021), this gives 2 oblivious deletion codes with redundancy $\sim 3\log n$, beating the existential redundancy for 2 adversarial deletions.
  (3) (Randomized oblivious) We give a randomized construction of oblivious codes that, with probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, produces a code correcting $t$ oblivious deletions with redundancy $\sim(t+1)\log n$, beating the existential adversarial redundancy of $\sim 2t\log n$.
  (4) (Randomized adversarial) Studying the oblivious model can inform better constructions of adversarial codes. The same technique produces, with probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, a code correcting $t$ adversarial deletions with redundancy $\sim (2t+1)\log n$, nearly matching the existential redundancy of $\sim 2t\log n$.
  The common idea behind these results is to reduce the hash size by modding by a prime chosen (randomly) from a small subset, and including a small encoding of the prime in the hash.</description>

      <title>Fast Simulation of Cellular Automata by Self-Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the configuration of any one-dimensional cellular automaton at generation $n$ can be accelerated by constructing and running a composite rule with a radius proportional to $\log n$. The new automaton is the original one, but with its local rule function composed with itself. Consequently, the asymptotic time complexity to compute the configuration of generation $n$ is reduced from $O(n^2)$-time to $O(n^2 / \log n)$, but with $O(n^2/(\log n)^3)$-space, demonstrating a time-memory tradeoff. Experimental results are given in the case of Rule 30.</description>

      <title>Simple general magnification of circuit lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a technically and conceptually simple approach to magnification of circuit and formula lower bounds. Central to the method are so-called distinguishers, sparse matrices that retain some of the key properties of error-correcting codes. As applications, we generalize and strengthen known general (not problem specific) magnification results and in particular achieve magnification thresholds below known lower bounds. For example, we show that fixed-polynomial formula-size lower bounds for NP are implied by slightly superlinear formula-size lower bounds for approximating any sufficiently sparse problem in NP. We also show that the thresholds achieved are sharp. Additionally, our approach yields a uniform magnification result for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP). This seems to sidestep the localization barrier.</description>

      <title>Area laws and tensor networks for maximally mixed ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show an area law in the mutual information for the
  maximally-mixed state $\Omega$ in the ground space of general
  Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space
  degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a `good'
  approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a
  crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations
  have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and
  2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a
  corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any
  $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system,
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big),
  \end{align*}
  where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and
  $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed
  maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition
  in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega
  \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in
  1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show
  that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with
  a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to
  a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond
  dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual
  information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local
  Hamiltonians.</description>
