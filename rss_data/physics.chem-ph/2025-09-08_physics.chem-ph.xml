      <title>Hierarchical Equations of Motion Solved with the Multiconfigurational Ehrenfest Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being a numerically exact method for the simulation of dynamics in open quantum systems, the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) still suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a novel MCE-HEOM method, which introduces the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest (MCE) ansatz to the second quantization formalism of HEOM. Here, the MCE equations of motion are derived from the time-dependent variational principle in a composed Hilbert-Liouville space, and each MCE coherent-state basis can be regarded as having an infinite hierarchical tier, such that the truncation tier of auxiliary density operators in MCE-HEOM can also be considered to be infinite. As demonstrated in a series of representative spin-boson models, our MCE-HEOM significantly reduces the number of variational parameters and could efficiently handle the strong non-Markovian effect, which is difficult for conventional HEOM due to the requirement of a very deep truncation tier. Compared with MCE, MCE-HEOM reduces the number of effective bath modes and circumvents the initial samplings for finite temperature, eventually resulting in a huge reduction of computational cost.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Simulation of an Alkaline Ni/Zn Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickel/zinc (Ni/Zn) technology is a promising post-lithium battery type for stationary applications with respect to aspects such as safety, environmental compatibility and resource availability. Although this battery type has been known for a long time, the theoretical knowledge about the processes taking place in the battery is limited. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the general cycling behaviour and the underlying processes, but also specific phenomena intrinsic to zinc-based cells such as zinc shape change, we carry out simulations based on a thermodynamically consistent and volume-averaged continuum model. We use a Ni/Zn prototype cell as a reference framework to provide a basis for modelling, parameter estimation and systematic comparison between simulated and experimental cell behaviour to improve cyclability and performance.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Barrier Crossing Events from Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature-accelerated sliced sampling (TASS) is a well-established enhanced sampling method that facilitates exhaustive exploration of high-dimensional collective variable (CV) space through directed sampling employing a combination of umbrella restraining biases, metadynamics biases, and temperature acceleration of CVs. In this work, we broaden the applicability of TASS by introducing a protocol for computing rate constants of barrier crossing events. The challenge addressed here is to recover kinetics from free energy data computed from different slices of the TASS simulation. The proposed protocol utilizes artificial neural networks based representation of high-dimensional free energy landscapes, and Infrequent Metadynamics. We demonstrate the accuracy of the approach by obtaining rate constants for the conformational change of alanine dipeptide in vacuo, the unbinding of benzamidine from trypsin, and the unbinding of aspirin from $\beta$-cyclodextrin.</description>

      <title>Analysis of fourth-, fifth-, and infinite-order triple excitations in unitary coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a correction to the unitary coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (UCCSD) that incorporates the effects of missing triple excitations through a treatment that is correct through fifth-order in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which we refer to as UCCSD[T-5]. We then benchmark the performance of UCCSD[T-5] alongside the previously developed fourth-order UCCSD[T], comparing both against the infinite-order treatment of triples in UCCSDT as well as full configuration interaction (FCI). Two key findings emerge from this analysis. First, the fourth-order correction in UCCSD[T] consistently provides the closest agreement with FCI in estimating ground state energies, outperforming both UCCSD[T-5] and UCCSDT. Second, the inclusion of fifth-order corrections as in UCCSD[T-5] largely recovers the infinite-order triples limit in UCCSDT. With the growing interest in UCC ans\"atze for quantum computing and the constraints imposed by current quantum hardware, these results underscore the potential of using classically computed perturbative corrections within UCC theory to salient triple excitation effects without requiring the additional quantum resources as would be demanded by the UCCSDT ansatz.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient subspace harmonic relaxation algorithm for coarse-graining of molecular systems with nearly exact thermodynamic consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, J. Chem. Phys. 162, 214101 (2025), a novel approach for the rigidification of a molecular cluster was proposed, in which starting with an all-atom (AA) potential, a coarse-grained (CG) potential for the associated cluster of rigid monomers was constructed directly. The method is based on using the harmonic approximation for the fast intramolecular degrees of freedom. While conceptually primitive, the resulting CG model turned out to be surprisingly accurate for selected water and ammonia clusters. However, as originally formulated, a single evaluation of the CG potential turned out to be much more expensive than the evaluation of the AA potential, since the former required a subspace minimization followed by a subspace normal mode calculation. In this communication, we formulate the approach more broadly, making it applicable, e.g., to coarse-graining a large protein. We also introduce key algorithmic improvements, reducing the cost of the subspace minimization and normal mode calculation. Combined with the fact that the CG simulation requires roughly an order of magnitude fewer Monte Carlo steps to reach similar statistical accuracy for selected observables compared to the AA model, the overall computational cost becomes comparable. These improvements are demonstrated on a water cluster.</description>

      <title>Mo Atom Rearrangement Drives Layer-Dependent Reactivity in Two-Dimensional MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a valuable platform for manipulating and studying chemical reactions at atomic level, owing to the ease of controlling their microscopic structure at the nanometer scale. While extensive research has been conducted on the structure-dependent chemical activity of 2D materials, the influence of structural transformation during the reaction remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report the layer-dependent chemical reactivity of MoS2 during a nitridation atomic substitution reaction and attribute it to the rearrangement of Mo atoms. Our results show that the chemical reactivity of MoS2 decreases as the number of layers is reduced in the few-layer regime. In particular, monolayer MoS2 exhibits significantly lower reactivity compared to its few-layer and multilayer counterparts. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that MoN nanonetworks form as reaction products from monolayer and bilayer MoS2, with the continuity of the MoN crystals increasing with layer number, consistent with the local conductivity mapping data. The layer-dependent reactivity is attributed to the relative stability of the hypothetically formed MoN phase which retain the number of Mo atomic layers present in the precursor. Specifically, the low chemical reactivity of monolayer MoS2 is attributed to the high energy cost associated with Mo atom diffusion and migration necessary to form multi-layer Mo lattices in the thermodynamically stable MoN phase. This study underscores the critical role of lattice rearrangement in governing chemical reactivity and highlights the potential of 2D materials as versatile platforms for advancing the understanding of materials chemistry at atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Qumode-Based Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Molecular Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Qumode Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver (QSS-VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing molecular excited states using the Fock basis of bosonic qumodes in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices. This approach harnesses the native universal gate sets of qubit-qumode architectures to construct highly expressive variational ansatze, offering potential advantages over conventional qubit-based methods. In QSS-VQE, the electronic structure Hamiltonian is first mapped to a qubit representation and subsequently embedded into the Fock space of bosonic qumodes, enabling efficient state preparation and reduced quantum resource requirements. We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches. These results highlight the promise of leveraging bosonic degrees of freedom for enhanced quantum simulation of complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Energy dependent Chemical Interface Damping induced by 1-Decanethiol Self-Assembled Monolayer on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical interface damping (CID) effect increases the collision frequency of free electrons in metals by changes of the metal surface. We have now experimentally disentangled the two contributions to CID: induced roughness and direct charge transfer. The latter is an important area of research in photoelectrochemistry with potential applications in light-induced chemical reactions. We present a broadband investigation of the CID effect on Au(111) covered by a self-assembled monolayer of decanethiol. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements show a photon energy dependent increase of collision frequency. We observe a constant, photon energy independent contribution, which is attributed to induced roughness and a contribution that linearly increases with photon energy from about 1 eV upwards which we attribute to direct charge transfer. The onset of the charge transfer mechanism corresponds to occupied orbitals of thiols bound to the Au surface, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>A foundation model for atomistic materials chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of matter, especially those that leverage first-principles (ab initio) electronic structure theory, provide a microscopic view of the world, underpinning much of our understanding of chemistry and materials science. Over the last decade or so, machine-learned force fields have transformed atomistic modeling by enabling simulations of ab initio quality over unprecedented time and length scales. However, early ML force fields have largely been limited by: (i) the substantial computational and human effort of developing and validating potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here we show that it is possible to create a general-purpose atomistic ML model, trained on a public dataset of moderate size, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics for a wide range of molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set of problems in the physical sciences, including properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions, interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model can be applied out of the box as a starting or "foundation" model for any atomistic system of interest and, when desired, can be fine-tuned on just a handful of application-specific data points to reach ab initio accuracy. Establishing that a stable force-field model can cover almost all materials changes atomistic modeling in a fundamental way: experienced users get reliable results much faster, and beginners face a lower barrier to entry. Foundation models thus represent a step towards democratising the revolution in atomic-scale modeling that has been brought about by ML force fields.</description>

      <title>Modeling Reactions on the Solid-Liquid Interface With Next Generation Extended Lagrangian Quantum-Based Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for atomistic simulations of surface catalysis under electrochemical bias. The framework makes use of extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer quantum-based molecular dynamics (XL-BOMD) simulations, which provide the speed and accuracy required for explicit atomistic treatment of both electrode and electrolyte. Simulations of solvated O$_2$ near nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) were performed to gain insight into the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Different mechanisms were observed, depending on the applied bias. Under high bias ORR occurred by an outer sphere mechanism, without adsorption of O$_2$ to NG. In this mechanism, electron transfer between the catalyst and the O$_2$ was mediated by the solvent. Under low bias ORR occurred by an inner sphere mechanism involving adsorption of O$_2$ to NG, leading to direct electron transfer. Combining quantum accuracy with explicit solvation and bias, XL-BOMD opens a route to predictive, atomistic insight into electrocatalytic processes beyond the reach of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Solvent Dynamics Drives the Formation of the Hydrated Electron in Photoexcited Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description>
