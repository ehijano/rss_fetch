      <title>GraphAge: Unleashing the power of Graph Neural Network to Decode Epigenetic Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic marker used in various clocks to predict epigenetic age. However, many existing clocks fail to account for crucial information about CpG sites and their interrelationships, such as co-methylation patterns. We present a novel approach to represent methylation data as a graph, using methylation values and relevant information about CpG sites as nodes, and relationships like co-methylation, same gene, and same chromosome as edges. We then use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict age. Thus our model, GraphAge, leverages both structural and positional information for prediction as well as better interpretation. Although we had to train in a constrained compute setting, GraphAge still showed competitive performance with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.207 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 25.277, slightly outperforming the current state of the art. Perhaps more importantly, we utilized GNN explainer for interpretation purposes and were able to unearth interesting insights (e.g., key CpG sites, pathways, and their relationships through Methylation Regulated Networks in the context of aging), which were not possible to 'decode' without leveraging the unique capability of GraphAge to 'encode' various structural relationships. GraphAge has the potential to consume and utilize all relevant information (if available) about an individual that relates to the complex process of aging. So, in that sense, it is one of its kind and can be seen as the first benchmark for a multimodal model that can incorporate all this information in order to close the gap in our understanding of the true nature of aging.</description>

      <title>A Novel Use of Pseudospectra in Mathematical Biology: Understanding HPA Axis Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is a major neuroendocrine system, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases. This system also presents interesting mathematical challenges for modeling. We consider a nonlinear delay differential equation model and calculate pseudospectra of three different linearizations: a time-dependent Jacobian, linearization around the limit cycle, and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of Koopman operators (global linearization). The time-dependent Jacobian provided insight into experimental phenomena, explaining why rats respond differently to perturbations during corticosterone secretion's upward versus downward slopes. We developed new mathematical techniques for the other two linearizations to calculate pseudospectra on Banach spaces and apply DMD to delay differential equations, respectively. These methods helped establish local and global limit cycle stability and study transients. Additionally, we discuss using pseudospectra to substantiate the model in experimental contexts and establish bio-variability via data-driven methods. This work is the first to utilize pseudospectra to explore the HPA axis.</description>
