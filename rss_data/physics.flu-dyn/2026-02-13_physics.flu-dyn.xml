      <title>On Capturing Laminar/Turbulent Regions Over a Wing Using WMLES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is performed for flow over a wing with a focus on documenting grid resolution requirements to predict both the laminar and turbulent regions accurately. Flow over a spanwise extruded NACA0012 airfoil at 0-degree angle of attack and freestream chord-based Reynolds numbers of 3 million is simulated using an unstructured-grid finite-volume solver. An equilibrium wall function with the first off-wall grid point as the exchange location is used. Two scenarios are simulated wherein either the entire airfoil surface, or only a portion of it, is assumed turbulent based on linear stability calculations. For the latter scenario, the regular no-slip wall boundary condition is imposed in laminar regions. Using the same grid that was employed in the fully turbulent case, WMLES captured the skin friction in the turbulent region close to the RANS results. However, the skin friction is not well captured in the laminar region, due to far few grid points inside the boundary layer. When the near-wall grid was refined in the wall normal direction, the laminar region was captured accurately, but the turbulent region was not resolved well because the first off-wall point moved below the buffer-layer. To reconcile differing resolution requirements in the laminar and turbulent regions, a grid was generated based on the varying boundary layer thickness estimated from a precursor RANS simulation with a specified transition location. This grid produced improved results in the laminar region but resulted in a delayed transition location. Unsteady disturbances with the most amplified frequencies were introduced upstream of the neutral point. The transition process in the laminar region and the skin friction in the turbulent region were then captured satisfactorily.</description>

      <title>A Preliminary Assessment of Coding Agents for CFD Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of tool-using coding agents to automate end-to-end workflows in the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM. Building on general-purpose coding agent interfaces, we introduce a lightweight configuration that guides an agent toward tutorial reuse and log-driven repair to improve case setup and execution. We evaluate this approach on the FoamBench-Advanced benchmark, covering both tutorial-derivative and planar 2D obstacle-flow tasks. For tutorial-derivative cases, prompt guidance dramatically increases execution completion rates and reduces unnecessary tool calls. For obstacle-flow cases, stronger language models such as GPT-5.2 markedly improve mesh generation and overall task completion compared to earlier models. Our findings show that coding agents can correctly execute a range of CFD simulations with minimal configuration and that model capability significantly influences performance on tasks requiring geometry and mesh creation. These results suggest that coding agents have practical utility for automating portions of CFD workflows while highlighting areas that require further investigation.</description>

      <title>Covariant Chu-Kovasznay Decomposition: Resolving Thermodynamic Ambiguity in Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Covariant Chu--Kovasznay Decomposition (CCKD), a geometric framework that resolves thermodynamic ambiguity in compressible mode content by formulating the decomposition on the effective acoustic spacetime. Enforcing orthogonality in the covariant Chu energy norm, we show that shock--turbulence interaction, often treated as a scattering source, is, in the idealized linear, inviscid setting, a near-unitary (Chu-isometric) scattering map constrained by conservation of covariant Chu-energy flux. In the canonical Shu-Osher problem, CCKD characterizes the shock as a thermo-acoustic lens, mathematically demonstrating that the transfer of entropy fluctuations into sound follows a geometric blue-shift ($k_{\mathrm{out}}=\Lambda k_{\mathrm{in}}$) analogous to gravitational blue-shift. Thus, while the mean flow produces entropy across the shock, the fluctuation mapping is information-preserving on the retained subspace; practical information loss arises from noise, truncation, and model mismatch, not shock physics.</description>

      <title>ArGEnT: Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer for Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and non-universality of pair dispersion in isothermal compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical properties of the pair dispersion of Lagrangian particles (tracers) in incompressible turbulent flows provide insights into transport and mixing. We explore the same in transonic to supersonic compressible turbulence of an isothermal ideal gas in two dimensions, driven by large-scale solenoidal and irrotational stirring forces, via direct numerical simulations. We find that the scaling exponents of the order-$p$ negative moments of the distribution of exit times -- in particular, the doubling and halving times of pair separations -- are nonlinear functions of $p$. Furthermore, the doubling and halving time statistics are different. The halving-time exponents are universal -- they satisfy their multifractal model-based prediction, irrespective of the nature of the stirring. However, the doubling-time exponents are not. In the solenoidally-stirred flows, the doubling time exponents can be expressed solely in terms of the multifractal scaling exponents obtained from the structure functions of the solenoidal component of the velocity. Moreover, they depend strongly on the Mach number, Ma, as elongated patches of high vorticity emerge along shock fronts at high Ma. In contrast, in the irrotationally-stirred flows, the doubling-time exponents do not satisfy any known multifractal model-based relation, and are independent of Ma. Our findings are of potential relevance to astrophysical disks and molecular clouds wherein turbulent transport and mixing of gases often govern chemical kinetics and the rates of formation of stars and planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Covariant Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition: Resolving Spurious Vorticity via Acoustic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The separation of acoustic and vortical fluctuations in compressible turbulence becomes ambiguous in thermodynamically inhomogeneous media, where refraction by entropy gradients and shocks can be misclassified as solenoidal content by Euclidean post-processing. We introduce a covariant Helmholtz--Hodge decomposition (CHHD) with respect to an effective acoustic metric, which identifies the irrotational (potential) component with the exact part of the metric-dual velocity one-form. Thermal refraction and shock-induced bending are absorbed into the induced curvature, ensuring that such geometric variations are not misidentified as physical vorticity. For canonical entropy-spot refraction and normal-shock discontinuities, Euclidean Helmholtz--Hodge and momentum-potential post-processing produce significant leakage in the refracting/discontinuous region, whereas the covariant splitting remains at the numerical noise floor (typically $\lesssim 10^{-12}$) throughout the domain, demonstrating robustness even at the sonic horizon, where the Euclidean metric singularity typically causes catastrophic error amplification. This geometric framework for velocity fields resolves the ambiguity of irrotational motion in inhomogeneous media and establishes a necessary foundation for future generalizations to full thermodynamic state vectors.</description>

      <title>The search for the gust-wing interaction "textbook"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address whether complex physical relations can be investigated through the synergy of automated high-volume experiments and the reduction of large datasets to a concise, representative subset of canonical examples -- a "textbook". To this end, we consider the unsteady aerodynamics of wing-gust interactions, which is characterized by its rich, high-dimensional physics. We take advantage of a purpose-built gust generator to systematically produce over 1,000 distinct random gust events and to measure the unsteady loads induced on a delta wing. We then employ a data summarization procedure to identify representative subsets of increasing size from the large-scale database, which then serve as training data for a machine-learning model of the aerodynamic loads from sparse pressure measurements. An appropriately selected "textbook" of a few events can achieve predictive accuracy comparable to random training sets up to two orders of magnitude larger, capturing the intrinsic diversity of the full-scale data and enhancing modeling efficiency and interpretability. Our methodology evidences the potential of distilling the essential information contained in large amounts of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. 2025, I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $\propto k^{3/4}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criterion for this process, revealing that young SNRs with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. 2025, this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>
