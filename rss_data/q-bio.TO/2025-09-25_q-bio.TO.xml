      <title>Magnetically Guided Endothelial BioBots: A Next-Generation Strategy for Treating Complex Cerebral Aneurysms</title>

Abstract: Cerebral aneurysms affect three to five percent of the population, and rupture remains a major cause of stroke-related death and disability. Current therapies, surgical clipping, endovascular coiling, and flow diversion, have improved outcomes but each carries limitations. Clipping is invasive and often unsuitable for deep or posterior lesions. Coiling is prone to recurrence from compaction or incomplete occlusion, particularly in wide-neck or fusiform aneurysms. Flow diverters offer improved durability but rely on rigid metallic scaffolds that may malappose in tortuous vessels, compromise branch arteries, delay endothelialization, and necessitate long-term dual antiplatelet therapy. These shortcomings highlight a gap in current management: devices primarily provide mechanical occlusion but fail to conform to complex geometries or reliably promote rapid, complete endothelialization. As a result, aneurysm necks may remain exposed to persistent flow, delayed healing, and thrombosis.
  To address this, we propose magnetically guided endothelial BioBots as a next-generation therapeutic strategy. BioBots are biodegradable hydrogel carriers embedded with magnetic nanoparticles and coated with primed endothelial progenitor cells. Delivered through microcatheters and guided by external electromagnetic fields, they can assemble across aneurysm defects. Once localized, they form a conformal, geometry-adaptive endothelial patch that provides immediate antithrombotic protection and, as the hydrogel degrades, leaves behind a stable, functional endothelial lining. By integrating microrobotic navigation with regenerative vascular biology, BioBots may overcome the central limitations of current devices and enable safer, more durable treatment for complex aneurysms.</description>
