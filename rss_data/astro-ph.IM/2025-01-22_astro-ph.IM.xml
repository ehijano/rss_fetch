      <title>Enhancing the Reliability in Machine Learning for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation with Attention-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.</description>

      <title>GPU Accelerated Image Quality Assessment-Based Software for Transient Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast imaging localises celestial transients using source finders in the image domain. The need for high computational throughput in this process is driven by next-generation telescopes such as Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which, upon completion, will be the world's largest aperture synthesis radio telescope. It will collect data at unprecedented velocity and volume. Due to the vast amounts of data the SKA will produce, current source finders based on source extraction may be inefficient in a wide-field search. In this paper, we focus on the software development of GPU-accelerated transient finders based on Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods -- Low-Information Similarity Index (LISI) and augmented LISI (augLISI). We accelerate the algorithms using GPUs, achieving kernel time of approximately 0.1 milliseconds for transient finding in 2048X2048 images.</description>

      <title>Serial MultiView: an efficient approach to mitigating atmospheric spatial-structure errors for VLBI astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric propagation errors are a main constraint on the accuracy of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. For relative astrometry, differential techniques can mitigate these errors, but their effectiveness diminishes with decreasing elevation and increasing angular separations between target and calibrator, among others. The MultiView technique addresses atmospheric spatial-structure errors by observing multiple calibrators around the target and interpolating at the target position, thereby reducing residual atmospheric errors more effectively than phase-referencing with only one calibrator. Conventional MultiView approach involves cyclically observing all calibrators and the target, fitting a phase plane from the phases of all calibrators in each cycle. This approach reduces on-target time and is restricted by the interferometer coherence time. We propose a new approach, serial MultiView, which rotates the phase plane iteratively based on the time series of calibrator residual phases. The new approach eliminates the need to observe all calibrators in each cycle, thus shortening the observing cycle and increasing the proportion of on-target time. Additionally, by incorporating time-domain information in the iterations, phase ambiguities can be accurately and automatically identified. This approach enables efficient high-accuracy differential astrometry and artifact-reduced imaging for astrophysical studies, and we provide a user-friendly tool for it.</description>

      <title>AstroPix: A Pixelated HVCMOS Sensor for Space-Based Gamma-Ray Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A next-generation medium-energy gamma-ray telescope targeting the MeV range would address open questions in astrophysics regarding how extreme conditions accelerate cosmic-ray particles, produce relativistic jet outflows, and more. One concept, AMEGO-X, relies upon the mission-enabling CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor silicon chip AstroPix. AstroPix is designed for space-based use, featuring low noise, low power consumption, and high scalability. Desired performance of the device include an energy resolution of 5 keV (or 10% FWHM) at 122 keV and a dynamic range per-pixel of 25-700 keV, enabled by the addition of a high-voltage bias to each pixel which supports a depletion depth of 500 um. This work reports on the status of the AstroPix development process with emphasis on the current version under test, version three (v3), and highlights of version two (v2). Version 3 achieves energy resolution of 10.4 +\- 3.2 % at 59.5 keV and 94 +\- 6 um depletion in a low-resistivity test silicon substrate.</description>

      <title>Disentangling stellar atmospheric parameters in astronomical spectra using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method based on Generative Adversaria! Networks (GANs) is developed for disentangling the physical (effective temperature and gravity) and chemical (metallicity, overabundance of a-elements with respect to iron) atmospheric properties in astronomical spectra. Using a projection of the stellar spectra, commonly called latent space, in which the contribution dueto one or several main stellar physicochemical properties is minimised while others are enhanced, it was possible to maximise the information related to certain properties, which can then be extracted using artificial neural networks (ANN) as regressors with higher accuracy than a reference method based on the use of ANN trained with the original spectra. Methods. Our model utilises autoencoders, comprising two artificial neural networks: an encoder anda decoder which transform input data into a low-dimensional representation known as latent space. It also uses discriminators, which are additional neural networks aimed at transforming the traditional autoencoder training into an adversaria! approach, to disentangle or reinforce the astrophysical parameters from the latent space. The GANDALF tool is described. It was developed to define, train, and test our GAN model with a web framework to show how the disentangling algorithm works visually. It is open to the community in Github. Results. The performance of our approach for retrieving atmospheric stellar properties from spectra is demonstrated using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrograph (RVS) data from DR3. We use a data-driven perspective and obtain very competitive values, ali within the literature errors, and with the advantage of an important dimensionality reduction of the data to be processed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced imaging of M87*: Simulations with the EHT and extended-KVN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has successfully revealed the shadow of the supermassive black hole, M87*, with an unprecedented angular resolution of approximately 20 uas at 230 GHz. However, because of limited short baseline lengths, the EHT has been constrained in its ability to recover larger scale jet structures. The extended Korean VLBI Network (eKVN) is committed to joining the EHT from 2024 that can improve short baseline coverage. This study evaluates the impact of the participation of eKVN in the EHT on the recovery of the M87* jet. Synthetic data, derived from a simulated M87* model, were observed using both the EHT and the combined EHT+eKVN arrays, followed by image reconstructions from both configurations. The results indicate that the inclusion of eKVN significantly improves the recovery of jet structures by reducing residual noise. Furthermore, jackknife tests, in which one or two EHT telescopes were omitted - simulating potential data loss due to poor weather - demonstrate that eKVN effectively compensates for these missing telescopes, particularly in short baseline coverage. Multi-frequency synthesis imaging at 86-230 GHz shows that the EHT+eKVN array enhances the recovered spectral index distribution compared to the EHT alone and improves image reconstruction at each frequency over single-frequency imaging. As the EHT continues to expand its array configuration and observing capabilities to probe black hole physics more in depth, the integration of eKVN into the EHT will significantly enhance the stability of observational results and improve image fidelity. This advancement will be particularly valuable for future regular monitoring observations, where consistent data quality is essential.</description>

      <title>DECH: Software Package for Astronomical Spectral Data Processing and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article provides a brief description of the software package DECH for processing and analysis of astronomical spectra. DECH supports all stages of processing and analysis of spectral data, including image preprocessing, spectra extraction (including those with a variable tilted slit), wavelength calibration by a two-dimensional polynomial, continuum normalization (manual or automatic), measurement of equivalent widths and radial velocities in various ways, cross-correlation analysis, etc. The DECH software package is actively used by astronomers from different countries and continues to be improved. In particular, utilities for processing and analysis of data from the high-resolution fiber-feed echelle spectrograph installed at 6-m telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory of Russian Academy of Sciences were added in the latest version. Software provides high-precision measurements of radial velocities, including those for detection of extraterrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. III. Search for companions to members of young associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absolute astrometry with Gaia is expected to detect and characterize the orbits of thousands of exoplanets in the coming years. A tool, GaiaPMEX, was recently developed to characterize multiple systems based on Gaia-only data, and, when possible, the Gaia-Hipparcos proper motion anomaly. We compare the detection capabilities of absolute astrometry and spectroscopy (RV), and to detect and characterize planetary-mass companions, combining the astrometric data with direct imaging and RV data. For companion masses possibly in the planetary range, we use direct imaging and when possible, RV data as well, to further constrain their nature and orbital properties.
  For each target, a diagnosis on its binarity based on absolute astrometry is given. When no binary is detected, we provides detection limits in the (sma, mass) space. We identify several companions with possible masses down to the brown dwarfs (BD; 50+) or planetary masses (13). We detect a new giant planet at less than 1-2 au from the M-type star G80-21. For AB Pic and HD 14082 B, we confirm the presence of substellar companions, and provide robust solutions for their mass and orbital properties. We further identify 9 planetary mass companions candidates. Finally, a detailed treatment of noises in Gaia astrometric measurements shows that there are no evidence at a 2-sigma level of two exoplanet detections previously announced.
  Combining GaiaPMEX and RV data is therefore perfectly adaptIn the 0.5 to 5 au domain, GaiaPMEX has an excellent sensitivity to BDs, and a good sensitivity to planetary mass planets for this sample.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Inferring Accretion Signatures in Young Stellar Objects: A Case Study with VIRUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to understanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even how planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion rates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph ($R \sim 800$, 3500-5500\r{A}) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly releasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which can also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code fits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each VIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between model parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach self-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a thorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not accomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates of each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to results separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to results from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions. Finally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were found among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful improvement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs observed by VIRUS or other spectrographs.</description>

      <title>A pioneering experiment combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data to measure Faraday rotation with GMIMS and the CGPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structures in the magneto-ionic medium exist across a wide range of angular sizes due to large-scale magnetic fields coherent over the Galactic spiral arms combined with small-scale fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density resulting from energy injection processes such as supernovae. For the first time, we produce diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission Faraday rotation maps covering all spatial scales down to $3'$ resolution for Galactic magnetic field studies. These maps complement standard total and polarized intensity maps combining single-antenna and interferometric data that have been produced, for example, for the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). Such combined maps have sensitivity to large scales from the single-antenna component, and the resolution from the interferometric component. We combine Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey High-Band-North (GMIMS-HBN) single-antenna and CGPS aperture-synthesis polarization data after spatial filtering, producing Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps individually for the four CGPS frequency channels. We calculate Rotation Measures (RM) for all pixels using a linear fit to polarization angle versus wavelength squared. The RM maps show magnetic field structures on the full range of scales probed by this dataset. Regions of smooth polarized emission require the large-scale sensitivity of the single-antenna data to illuminate the Faraday depths, while the aperture-synthesis data reveal small-scale variability in the Faraday rotation. Despite the limitation of the 35 MHz bandwidth of the CGPS, we demonstrate that useful information on Faraday rotation structures can be obtained by combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data, highlighting the important synergy between future broadband interferometric and single-antenna polarization surveys.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>A Realistic Projection for Constraining Neutron Star Equation of State with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Detector Network in the A+ Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network in the upcoming A+ era with upgrades of both Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will enable more frequent and precise observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, improving constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS). In this study, we applied reduced order quadrature techniques for full parameter estimation of 3,000 simulated gravitational wave signals from BNS mergers at A+ sensitivity following three EOS models: HQC18, SLY230A, and MPA1. We found that tidal deformability tends to be overestimated at higher mass and underestimated at lower mass. We postprocessed the parameter estimation results to present our EOS recovery accuracies, identify biases within EOS constraints and their causes, and quantify the needed corrections.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity in a compact binary inspiral is yet to be observed. We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. We find cases of striking improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward potential eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>Rising Stargirls: Benefits of a Creative Arts-Based Approach to Astronomy Education for Middle-School Girls from Underrepresented Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Women from historically marginalized groups in the sciences continue to be severely underrepresented in the fields of physics and astronomy. Young girls identifying with these groups often lose interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields well before college. Middle school (grades 6-8) emerges as a pivotal phase for nurturing science identities among girls. The educational program Rising Stargirls offers creative arts-based astronomy workshops for middle-school girls, with the aim of cultivating their science identities. We retrospectively analyze participants' responses to four key assessment items through which their engagement in science and their science identities before and after the workshops are assessed. Our findings overwhelmingly indicate that girls exhibit heightened engagement in science and enhanced science identities after engaging in the Rising Stargirls program. These outcomes underscore the merits of fostering creativity and integrating the arts into science education.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

      <title>PyEMILI: A New Generation Computer-aided Spectral Line Identifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep high-dispersion spectroscopy of Galactic photoionized gaseous nebulae, mainly planetary nebulae and HII regions, has revealed numerous emission lines. As a key step of spectral analysis, identification of emission lines hitherto has mostly been done manually, which is a tedious task, given that each line needs to be carefully checked against huge volumes of atomic transition/spectroscopic database to reach a reliable assignment of identity. Using Python, we have developed a line-identification code PyEMILI, which is a significant improvement over the Fortran-based package EMILI introduced ~20 years ago. In our new code PyEMILI, the major shortcomings in EMILI's line-identification technique have been amended. Moreover, the atomic transition database utilized by PyEMILI was adopted from Atomic Line List v3.00b4 but greatly supplemented with theoretical transition data from the literature. The effective recombination coefficients of the CII, OII, NII and NeII nebular lines are collected from the literature to form a subset of the atomic transition database to aid identification of faint optical recombination lines in the spectra of PNe and HII regions. PyEMILI is tested using the deep, high-dispersion spectra of two Galactic PNe, Hf2-2 and IC418, and gives better results of line identification than EMILI does. We also ran PyEMILI on the optical spectrum of a late-type [WC11] star UVQS J060819.93-715737.4 recently discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and our results agree well with the previous manual identifications. The new identifier PyEMILI is applicable to not only emission-line nebulae but also emission stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE). V. Complete observations, data reduction and analysis, detection performances, and final results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the past decade, state-of-the-art planet-finder instruments like SPHERE@VLT, coupling coronagraphic devices and extreme adaptive optics systems, unveiled, thanks to large surveys, around 20 planetary mass companions at semi-major axis greater than 10 astronomical units. Direct imaging being the only detection technique to be able to probe this outer region of planetary systems, the SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE) was designed and conducted from 2015 to 2021 to study the demographics of such young gas giant planets around 400 young nearby solar-type stars. In this paper, we present the observing strategy, the data quality, and the point sources analysis of the full SHINE statistical sample as well as snapSHINE. Both surveys used the SPHERE@VLT instrument with the IRDIS dual band imager in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph IFS and the angular differential imaging observing technique. All SHINE data (650 datasets), corresponding to 400 stars, including the targets of the F150 survey, are processed in a uniform manner with an advanced post-processing algorithm called PACO ASDI. An emphasis is put on the classification and identification of the most promising candidate companions. Compared to the previous early analysis SHINE F150, the use of advanced post-processing techniques significantly improved by one or 2 magnitudes (x3-x6) the contrast detection limits, which will allow us to put even tighter constraints on the radial distribution of young gas giants. This increased sensitivity directly places SHINE as the largest and deepest direct imaging survey ever conducted. We detected and classified more than 3500 physical sources. One additional substellar companion has been confirmed during the second phase of the survey (HIP 74865 B), and several new promising candidate companions are awaiting second epoch confirmations.</description>

Abstract: We detail the the REACH radiometric system designed to enable measurements of the 21-cm neutral hydrogen line. Included is the radiometer architecture and end-to-end system simulations as well as a discussion of the challenges intrinsic to highly-calibratable system development. Following this, we share laboratory results based on the calculation of noise wave parameters utilising an over-constrained least squares approach demonstrating a calibration RMSE of 80 mK for five hours of integration on a custom-made source with comparable impedance to that of the antenna used in the field. This paper therefore documents the state of the calibrator and data analysis in December 2022 in Cambridge before shipping to South Africa.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (sub)millimeter sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub)millimeter telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA): $N$-body simulations in an emulated frame of reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, so machine-learning (ML)-based emulation techniques have emerged as a way to increase their speed. Although fast, surrogate models have limited trustworthiness due to potentially substantial emulation errors that current approaches cannot correct for. To alleviate this problem, we introduce COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA), a hybrid framework interfacing ML with an $N$-body simulator. The correct physical equations of motion are solved in an emulated frame of reference, so that any emulation error is corrected by design. This approach corresponds to solving for the perturbation of particle trajectories around the machine-learnt solution, which is computationally cheaper than obtaining the full solution, yet is guaranteed to converge to the truth as one increases the number of force evaluations. Although applicable to any ML algorithm and $N$-body simulator, this approach is assessed in the particular case of particle-mesh cosmological simulations in a frame of reference predicted by a convolutional neural network, where the time dependence is encoded as an additional input parameter to the network. COCA efficiently reduces emulation errors in particle trajectories, requiring far fewer force evaluations than running the corresponding simulation without ML. We obtain accurate final density and velocity fields for a reduced computational budget. We demonstrate that this method shows robustness when applied to examples outside the range of the training data. When compared to the direct emulation of the Lagrangian displacement field using the same training resources, COCA's ability to correct emulation errors results in more accurate predictions. COCA makes $N$-body simulations cheaper by skipping unnecessary force evaluations, while still solving the correct equations of motion and correcting for emulation errors made by ML.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deconvolution of Astronomical Images with Diffusion Models: Quantifying Prior-Driven Features in Reconstructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconvolution of astronomical images is a key aspect of recovering the intrinsic properties of celestial objects, especially when considering ground-based observations. This paper explores the use of diffusion models (DMs) and the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) algorithm to solve this inverse problem task. We apply score-based DMs trained on high-resolution cosmological simulations, through a Bayesian setting to compute a posterior distribution given the observations available. By considering the redshift and the pixel scale as parameters of our inverse problem, the tool can be easily adapted to any dataset. We test our model on Hyper Supreme Camera (HSC) data and show that we reach resolutions comparable to those obtained by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Most importantly, we quantify the uncertainty of reconstructions and propose a metric to identify prior-driven features in the reconstructed images, which is key in view of applying these methods for scientific purposes.</description>

      <title>A comparison of shrinkage estimators of the cosmological precision matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the covariance matrix and its inverse, the precision matrix, is critical in the statistical analysis of cosmological measurements. The covariance matrix is typically estimated with a limited number of simulations at great computational cost before inversion into the precision matrix; therefore, it can be ill-conditioned and overly noisy when the sample size $n$ used for estimation is not much larger than the data vector dimension. In this work, we consider a class of methods known as shrinkage estimation for the precision matrix, which combines an empirical estimate with a target that is either analytical or stochastic. These methods include linear and non-linear shrinkage applied to the covariance matrix (the latter represented by the so-called NERCOME estimator), and the direct linear shrinkage estimation of the precision matrix which we introduce in a cosmological setting. Using Bayesian parameter inference as well as metrics like matrix loss functions and the eigenvalue spectrum, we compare their performance against the standard sample estimator with varying sample size $n$. We have found the shrinkage estimators to significantly improve the posterior distribution at low $n$, especially for the linear shrinkage estimators either inverted from the covariance matrix or applied directly to the precision matrix, with an empirical target constructed from the sample estimate. Our results should be particularly relevant to the analyses of Stage-IV spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid, whose statistical power can be limited by the computational cost of obtaining an accurate precision matrix estimate.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets in reflected starlight with dual-field interferometry: A case for shorter wavelengths and a fifth Unit Telescope at VLTI/Paranal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direct observation of cold and temperate planets within 1 to 10 AU would be extremely valuable for uncovering their atmospheric compositions but remains a formidable challenge with current astronomical methods. Ground-based optical interferometry, capable of high angular-resolution imaging, offers a promising avenue for studying these exoplanets, complementing space-based observations. Our objective is to explore the fundamental limits of dual-field interferometry and assess its potential for characterizing exoplanets in reflected light using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We developed analytical expressions to describe the performance of dual-field interferometry and integrated these with simulations of atmospheric wavefronts corrected by extreme Adaptive Optics. An analytical solution for optimal phase apodization was formulated to enhance starlight rejection when injected into a single-mode fibre. This framework was applied to determine the detectability of known exoplanets in reflected light across various wavelength bands for both the current VLTI and a proposed extended version. Our results indicate that employing shorter wavelengths improves detectability, enabling at least seven Jupiter-mass exoplanets to be observed in the J band with current VLTI's baselines. Adding new baselines with lengths beyond 200 meters significantly enhances VLTI's capabilities, increasing the number of detectable exoplanets and revealing potential habitable zone candidates such as $\tau$ Ceti e and Proxima Centauri b. To substantially improve the VLTI's exoplanet characterization capabilities, we recommend developing instrumentation at wavelengths shorter than 1$\,\mu$m, as well as the addition of a fifth Unit Telescope (UT5).</description>

Abstract: Recent discoveries by neutrino telescopes, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, relied extensively on machine learning (ML) tools to infer physical quantities from the raw photon hits detected. Neutrino telescope reconstruction algorithms are limited by the sparse sampling of photons by the optical modules due to the relatively large spacing ($10-100\,{\rm m})$ between them. In this letter, we propose a novel technique that learns photon transport through the detector medium through the use of deep learning-driven super-resolution of data events. These ``improved'' events can then be reconstructed using traditional or ML techniques, resulting in improved resolution. Our strategy arranges additional ``virtual'' optical modules within an existing detector geometry and trains a convolutional neural network to predict the hits on these virtual optical modules. We show that this technique improves the angular reconstruction of muons in a generic ice-based neutrino telescope. Our results readily extend to water-based neutrino telescopes and other event morphologies.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Merger Search Pipeline Powered by Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves are now routinely detected from compact binary mergers, with binary neutron star mergers being of note for multi-messenger astronomy as they have been observed to produce electromagnetic counterparts. Novel search pipelines for these mergers could increase the combined search sensitivity, and could improve the ability to detect real gravitational wave signals in the presence of glitches and non-stationary detector noise. Deep learning has found success in other areas of gravitational wave data analysis, but a sensitive deep learning-based search for binary neutron star mergers has proven elusive due to their long signal length. In this work, we present a deep learning pipeline for detecting binary neutron star mergers. By training a convolutional neural network to detect binary neutron star mergers in the signal-to-noise ratio time series, we concentrate signal power into a shorter and more consistent timescale than strain-based methods, while also being able to train our network to be robust against glitches. We compare our pipeline's sensitivity to the three offline detection pipelines using injections in real gravitational wave data, and find that our pipeline has a comparable sensitivity to the current pipelines below the 1 per 2 months detection threshold. Furthermore, we find that our pipeline can increase the total number of binary neutron star detections by 12% at a false alarm rate of 1 per 2 months. The pipeline is also able to successfully detect the two binary neutron star mergers detected so far by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, GW170817 and GW190425, despite the loud glitch present in GW170817.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the gap between real and simulated nebulae: A domain-adaptation approach to classify ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classifying ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies is crucial to studying stellar feedback mechanisms and understanding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium. This classification task is generally performed by comparing observed line ratios with photoionisation simulations of different types of nebulae (HII regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants). However, due to simplifying assumptions, such simulations are generally unable to fully reproduce the line ratios in observed nebulae. This discrepancy limits the performance of the classical machine-learning approach, where a model is trained on the simulated data and then used to classify real nebulae. For this study, we used a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to bridge the gap between photoionisation models (source domain) and observed ionised nebulae from the PHANGS-MUSE survey (target domain). The DANN is an example of a domain-adaptation algorithm, whose goal is to maximise the performance of a model trained on labelled data in the source domain on an unlabelled target domain by extracting domain-invariant features. Our results indicate a significant improvement in classification performance in the target domain when employing the DANN framework compared to a classical neural network (NN) classifier. Additionally, we investigated the impact of adding noise to the source dataset, finding that noise injection acts as a form of regularisation, further enhancing the performances of both the NN and DANN models on the observational data. The combined use of domain adaptation and noise injection improved the classification accuracy in the target domain by 23%. This study highlights the potential of domain adaptation methods in tackling the domain-shift challenge when using theoretical models to train machine-learning pipelines in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Effects of Array Mutual Coupling in 21-cm Experiments with the SKA-Low Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Mutual Coupling (MC) between antennas on the time-delay power spectrum response of the core of the SKA-Low radio telescope. Using two in-house tools - Fast Array Simulation Tool (FAST) (a fast full-wave electromagnetic solver) and OSKAR (a GPU-accelerated radio telescope simulator) - we simulate station beams and compute visibilities for various array layouts (regular, sunflower, and random). Simulations are conducted in an Epoch of Reionisation subband between 120-150~MHz, with a fine frequency resolution of 100~kHz, enabling the investigation of longer delays. Our results show that MC effects significantly increase foreground leakage into longer delays, especially for regular station layouts. For 21-cm science, foreground spill-over into the 21-cm window extends beyond $k_{\parallel} \sim 2$~h$^{-1}$Mpc for all station layouts and across all $k_{\perp}$ modes, completely obscuring the detection window. We find that attempting to remove the foreground contribution from the visibilities using an approximated beam model, based on the average embedded element pattern or interpolating the embedded element patterns from a coarse channel rate of 781~kHz, results in residuals around 1% ($\sim 10^{11}~\mathrm{mK}^2$h$^{-3}\mathrm{Mpc}^3$) which is still around 7 orders of magnitude brighter than the expected level of the EoR signal ($\sim 10^{4}~\mathrm{mK}^2$h$^{-3}\mathrm{Mpc}^3$). We also find that station beam models with at least 4-5 significant digits in the far-field pattern and high spectral resolution are needed for effective foreground removal. Our research provides critical insights into the role of MC in SKA-Low experiments and highlights the computational challenges of fully integrating array patterns that account for MC effects into processing pipelines.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated LISA parameter estimation with full time domain response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first full Bayesian inference analysis for LISA parameter estimation incorporating the effects of subdominant harmonics and spin-precession through a full time domain response. The substantial computational demands of using time domain waveforms for LISA are significantly mitigated by implementing a novel Python version of the IMRPhenomT family of waveform models and the LISA response with GPU acceleration. This time domain response alleviates the theoretical necessity of developing specific transfer functions to approximate the LISA response in the Fourier domain for each specific type of system and allows for the use of unequal arms configurations and realistic LISA orbits. Our analysis includes a series of zero-noise injections for a Massive Black Hole Binary with aligned and precessing spins. We investigate the impact of including subdominant harmonics, compare equal and unequal arm configurations, and analyze different Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI) configurations. We utilize full and uniform priors, with a lower frequency cutoff of 0.1mHz, and a signal duration of approximately two months, sampled every 5 seconds. The sampler is initialized based on Fisher estimates. Our results demonstrate LISA capability to measure the two spin magnitudes and the primary spin tilt angle, alongside sky localization, with percent-level precision, while component masses are determined with sub-percent accuracy.</description>
