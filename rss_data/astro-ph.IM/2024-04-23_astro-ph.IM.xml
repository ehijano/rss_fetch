      <title>Direct Comparison of SiPM and PMT Sensor Performances in a large-size imaging air Cherenkov telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peak photon detection efficiency (PDE) of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) can be as good or better than the PDE of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). There are experiments where the signal is measured in the presence of a strong, steady background light emission. In these, one needs to accurately evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) observe in the presence of strong noise induced by the light of the night sky. It is certainly interesting to investigate the SiPM performance under operational conditions of IACTs and to compare it with that of the PMTs. For that purpose, we built a SiPM-based detector module, which was installed in one of the imaging cameras of the two Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes in 2015. The experience gained from that module was used to design the second generation of modules of improved performance. Two such modules were installed in 2017. MAGIC is a system of two IACTs located on the Canary Island of La Palma. The mechanical structure of the MAGIC imaging cameras offers the possibility to install up to 6 additional detector modules of 7 pixels each into the open vertices of the hexagonal-shaped camera. This allows us to directly, without making any assumption, compare the performance of the PMT-based modules with that of the SiPM-based prototype modules, where SiPMs from three different manufacturers are used.</description>

      <title>Pipeline Provenance for Analysis, Evaluation, Trust or Reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data volumes and rates of research infrastructures will continue to increase in the upcoming years and impact how we interact with their final data products. Little of the processed data can be directly investigated and most of it will be automatically processed with as little user interaction as possible. Capturing all necessary information of such processing ensures reproducibility of the final results and generates trust in the entire process. We present PRAETOR, a software suite that enables automated generation, modelling, and analysis of provenance information of Python pipelines. Furthermore, the evaluation of the pipeline performance, based upon a user defined quality matrix in the provenance, enables the first step of machine learning processes, where such information can be fed into dedicated optimisation procedures.</description>

      <title>Detecting stellar flares in photometric data using hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) for discovering stellar flares in light curve data of stars. HMMs provide a framework to model time series data that are not stationary; they allow for systems to be in different states at different times and consider the probabilities that describe the switching dynamics between states. In the context of stellar flares discovery, we exploit the HMM framework by allowing the light curve of a star to be in one of three states at any given time step: Quiet, Firing, or Decaying. This three state HMM formulation is designed to enable straightforward identification of stellar flares, their duration, and associated uncertainty. This is crucial for estimating the flare's energy, and is useful for studies of stellar flare energy distributions. We combine our HMM with a celerite model that accounts for quasi periodic stellar oscillations. Through an injection recovery experiment, we demonstrate and evaluate the ability of our method to detect and characterize flares in stellar time series. We also show that the proposed HMM flags fainter and lower energy flares more easily than traditional sigma clipping methods. Lastly, we visually demonstrate that simultaneously conducting detrending and flare detection can mitigate biased estimations arising in multistage modelling approaches. Thus, this method paves a new way to calculating stellar flare energy. We conclude with an example application to one star observed by TESS, showing how the HMM compares with sigma clipping when using real data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive algorithms for low-latency cancellation of seismic Newtonian-noise at the Virgo gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system was recently implemented in the Virgo detector to cancel noise in its data produced by seismic waves directly coupling with the suspended test masses through gravitational interaction. The data from seismometers are being filtered to produce a coherent estimate of the associated gravitational noise also known as Newtonian noise. The first implementation of the system uses a time-invariant (static) Wiener filter, which is the optimal filter for Newtonian-noise cancellation assuming that the noise is stationary. However, time variations in the form of transients and slow changes in correlations between sensors are possible and while time-variant filters are expected to cope with these variations better than a static Wiener filter, the question is what the limitations are of time-variant noise cancellation. In this study, we present a framework to study the performance limitations of time-variant noise cancellation filters and carry out a proof-of-concept with adaptive filters on seismic data at the Virgo site. We demonstrate that the adaptive filters, at least those with superior architecture, indeed significantly outperform the static Wiener filter with the residual noise remaining above the statistical error bound.</description>

      <title>ALMA 2D Super-resolution Imaging of Taurus-Auriga Protoplanetary Disks: Probing Statistical Properties of Disk Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks revealed various substructures including gaps and rings. Their origin may be probed through statistical studies on the physical properties of the substructures. We present the analyses of archival ALMA Band 6 continuum data of 43 disks (39 Class II and 4 Herbig Ae) in the Taurus-Auriga region. We employ a novel 2D super-resolution imaging technique based on sparse modeling to obtain images with high fidelity and spatial resolution. As a result, we have obtained images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au ($0''.02 - 0''.1$), which is two to three times better than conventional CLEAN methods. All dust disks are spatially resolved, with the radii ranging from 8 to 238 au with a median radius of 45 au. Half of the disks harbor clear gap structures, whose radial locations show a bimodal distribution with peaks at $\lesssim20$ au and $\gtrsim30$ au. We also see structures indicating weak gaps at all the radii in the disk. We find that the widths of these gaps increase with their depths, which is consistent with the model of planet-disk interactions. The inferred planet mass-orbital radius distribution indicates that the planet distribution is analogous to our Solar System. However, planets with Neptune mass or lower may exist in all the radii.</description>

      <title>DALI sensitivity to streaming axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter substructures emerge naturally in a scenario in which the axion angular field acquires propagating degrees of freedom in a post-inflationary Universe. The DALI experiment is a new generation wavy dark matters interferometer currently in prototyping. Although DALI's main objective is to explore the virialized DM in our Galaxy, to a large degree in this article we explore the prospect for detection of fine grained streams made of axions that would enter the Solar System, as suggested by previous work. We find that DALI will have a sensitivity to encounters with these coherent objects that fully spans the window defined by the coupling strength to photons of representative axion models over a stacked bandwidth of two decades in mass.</description>

      <title>Infrared-Radio-follow-up Observations for Detection of the Magnetic Radio Emission of Extra-Solar Planets: A New Window to Detect Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several methods for indirectly detecting exoplanets, such as transit, radial velocity, astrometry, and the conventional gravitational microlensing approach. These methods rely on observing the effects of exoplanets on the emission or motion of observed stars. All these techniques have focused on the optical or infrared domains. However, an alternative method for exoplanet detection via microlensing events involves planets orbiting the source star, creating a binary source system. In this study, we explore a novel approach to detecting and studying exoplanets exclusively through their radio emissions resulting from magnetospheric processes. We propose utilizing the Roman telescope as a survey observer to detect microlensing events. Subsequently, we investigate the potential for detecting planetary radio signals through follow-up observations of these microlensing events in the radio band using the SKA telescope. This method is viable due to the comparable radio emission levels of exoplanets and their parent stars, unlike optical and infrared emissions. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to replicate the observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope, followed by a follow-up observation in radio frequencies using the SKA telescope. We determine that approximately 1155 exoplanets exhibit detectable signals by the SKA telescope during the 7-season observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope. This result indicates that such a method cannot only facilitate the direct detection of exoplanets but also enable the measurement of their magnetic field strength through analysis of their radio emissions.</description>

      <title>A review of 70 years with astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1953 I heard of an experiment in 1925 by Bengt Str\"omgren where he observed transit times with the meridian circle at the Copenhagen University Observatory measuring the current in a photocell behind slits when a star was crossing. In 1954 just 22 years old I was given the task as a student to make first test observations with a new meridian circle of the observatory. I became fascinated by the instrument and by the importance of astrometry for astronomy. Work at four meridian circles, two in Denmark, one in Hamburg, one in Lund, and Pierre Lacroute's vision of space astrometry in France had by 1973 created the foundation for development of the Hipparcos satellite, and Gaia followed. In 2013 I proposed a successor satellite which has gained momentum especially thanks to the efforts of David Hobbs and it has a good chance to be launched by ESA about 2045. But 70 years ago, optical astrometry was considered a dying branch of astronomy, unattractive compared with astrophysics. The following growth built on the still active interest in astrometry in Europe in those years and it was supported by ESA, the European Space Agency. This review is only about astrometry where I was personally involved.</description>

      <title>Isolated pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magneto-rotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron-star birth properties and their dynamical and magneto-rotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic-field strengths, $B$, and spin periods, $P$, from log-normal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic-field decay with a power law. Each log-normal is described by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index, $a_{\rm late}$. We subsequently model the stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and produce a large database of synthetic $P$-$\dot{P}$ diagrams by varying our five magneto-rotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters' posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain $\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} = 0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the log-normal distributions, and $a_{\rm late} = -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at $95\%$ credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred $a_{\rm late}$ value. Our approach represents a crucial step towards robust statistical inference for complex population-synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multi-wavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>Production of Alternate Realizations of DESI Fiber Assignment for Unbiased Clustering Measurement in Data and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical requirement of spectroscopic large scale structure analyses is correcting for selection of which galaxies to observe from an isotropic target list. This selection is often limited by the hardware used to perform the survey which will impose angular constraints of simultaneously observable targets, requiring multiple passes to observe all of them. In SDSS this manifested solely as the collision of physical fibers and plugs placed in plates. In DESI, there is the additional constraint of the robotic positioner which controls each fiber being limited to a finite patrol radius. A number of approximate methods have previously been proposed to correct the galaxy clustering statistics for these effects, but these generally fail on small scales. To accurately correct the clustering we need to upweight pairs of galaxies based on the inverse probability that those pairs would be observed (Bianchi \&amp; Percival 2017). This paper details an implementation of that method to correct the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey for incompleteness. To calculate the required probabilities, we need a set of alternate realizations of DESI where we vary the relative priority of otherwise identical targets. These realizations take the form of alternate Merged Target Ledgers (AMTL), the files that link DESI observations and targets. We present the method used to generate these alternate realizations and how they are tracked forward in time using the real observational record and hardware status, propagating the survey as though the alternate orderings had been adopted. We detail the first applications of this method to the DESI One-Percent Survey (SV3) and the DESI year 1 data. We include evaluations of the pipeline outputs, estimation of survey completeness from this and other methods, and validation of the method using mock galaxy catalogs.</description>
