      <title>Sampling Electronic Fock States using Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.</description>

      <title>Observation of vortices in a dipolar supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms. Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids. This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand et al., arXiv:2306.11457] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it quantitatively describes the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>A blue repulsive potential for dysprosium Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-wavelength repulsive potentials for quantum gases allow to realize new systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition in a Two-dimensional Dipolar Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions induce complex order in quantum systems. It becomes particularly interesting in two-dimension (2D), where the superfluidity with quasi-long-range order emerges via Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism, which still remains elusive with dipolar interactions. Here, we observe the BKT transition from a normal gas to the superfluid phase in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms. Controlling the orientation of dipoles, we characterize the transition point by monitoring extended coherence and measuring the equation of state. This allows us to gain a systematic understanding of the BKT transition based on an effective short-range description of dipolar interaction in 2D. Additionally, we observe anisotropic density fluctuations and non-local effects in the superfluid regime, which establishes the dipolar nature of the 2D superfluid. Our results lay the ground for understanding the behavior of dipolar bosons in 2D and open up opportunities for examining complex orders in a dipolar superfluid.</description>

      <title>PT-symmetric dynamical confinement: Fermi acceleration, quantum force and Berry phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum particle under the dynamical confinement caused by PT-symmetric box with a moving wall. The latter is described in terms of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation obeying the time-dependent PT-symmetric boundary conditions. The class of the functions, describing time-dependence of the wall's position and keeping the system as PT-symmetric is found. Physically observable characteristics, such as average kinetic energy and the average quantum force are calculated as a function of time. Also, geometric phase is calculated for the harmonically oscillating wall regime. Experimental realization of the proposed model is discussed.</description>

      <title>Temperature-induced supersolidity in spin-orbit-coupled Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close to the superfluid plane-wave (PW) - supersolid stripe (ST) phase transition point of a zero temperature quasi-one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas, we find that an increase in temperature induces a phase transition to the supersolid phase with a broken translational symmetry from the superfluid plane-wave phase. We use the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with the Popov approximation to investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the collective excitation spectrum and investigate the softening of the spin-dipole mode corresponding to the shift in the quantum critical point. This is in stark contrast to the PW-ST phase transition in a homogeneous system where non-zero temperatures facilitate the melting of the stripe phase.</description>

      <title>The transition and coexistence of quantum droplets and solitons in quasi-1D dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our study, we investigated bright solitons, dark solitons, and quantum droplets in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose gases, and further validated the crossover and coexistence of quantum droplets and solitons using the Lieb-Liniger energy within the framework of local density approximation. Increasing the particle number transforms the bright dipolar soliton state into a stable self-bound quantum droplet state, with further increases in leading to a broader quantum droplet that enables the presence of dark solitons within it.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundary Modes in Nonlinear Dynamics with Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry play a pivotal role in multiple areas of physics, yet they remain unstudied in systems with nonlinear interactions whose nonlinear normal modes do not exhibit $\textbf{U}(1)$-gauge symmetry. In this work, we establish particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry in such systems. Chiral symmetry ensures the quantization of the Berry phase of nonlinear normal modes and categorizes the topological phases of nonlinear dynamics. We show topologically protected static boundary modes in chiral-symmetric nonlinear systems. Our theoretical framework extends particle-hole and chiral symmetries to nonlinear dynamics, whose nonlinear modes do not necessarily yield $\textbf{U}(1)$-gauge symmetry.</description>
