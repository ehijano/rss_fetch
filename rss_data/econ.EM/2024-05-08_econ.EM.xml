      <title>Testing the Fairness-Improvability of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many algorithms have a disparate impact in that their benefits or harms fall disproportionately on certain social groups. Addressing an algorithm's disparate impact can be challenging, however, because it is not always clear whether there exists an alternative more-fair algorithm that does not compromise on other key objectives such as accuracy or profit. Establishing the improvability of algorithms with respect to multiple criteria is of both conceptual and practical interest: in many settings, disparate impact that would otherwise be prohibited under US federal law is permissible if it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business interest. The question is how a policy maker can formally substantiate, or refute, this necessity defense. In this paper, we provide an econometric framework for testing the hypothesis that it is possible to improve on the fairness of an algorithm without compromising on other pre-specified objectives. Our proposed test is simple to implement and can incorporate any exogenous constraint on the algorithm space. We establish the large-sample validity and consistency of our test, and demonstrate its use empirically by evaluating a healthcare algorithm originally considered by Obermeyer et al. (2019). In this demonstration, we find strong statistically significant evidence that it is possible to reduce the algorithm's disparate impact without compromising on the accuracy of its predictions.</description>

      <title>SVARs with breaks: Identification and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a class of structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) characterized by structural breaks (SVAR-WB). Together with standard restrictions on the parameters and on functions of them, we also consider constraints across the different regimes. Such constraints can be either (a) in the form of stability restrictions, indicating that not all the parameters or impulse responses are subject to structural changes, or (b) in terms of inequalities regarding particular characteristics of the SVAR-WB across the regimes. We show that all these kinds of restrictions provide benefits in terms of identification. We derive conditions for point and set identification of the structural parameters of the SVAR-WB, mixing equality, sign, rank and stability restrictions, as well as constraints on forecast error variances (FEVs). As point identification, when achieved, holds locally but not globally, there will be a set of isolated structural parameters that are observationally equivalent in the parametric space. In this respect, both common frequentist and Bayesian approaches produce unreliable inference as the former focuses on just one of these observationally equivalent points, while for the latter on a non-vanishing sensitivity to the prior. To overcome these issues, we propose alternative approaches for estimation and inference that account for all admissible observationally equivalent structural parameters. Moreover, we develop a pure Bayesian and a robust Bayesian approach for doing inference in set-identified SVAR-WBs. Both the theory of identification and inference are illustrated through a set of examples and an empirical application on the transmission of US monetary policy over the great inflation and great moderation regimes.</description>

      <title>Causal Duration Analysis with Diff-in-Diff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In economic program evaluation, it is common to obtain panel data in which outcomes are indicators that an individual has reached an absorbing state. For example, they may indicate whether an individual has exited a period of unemployment, passed an exam, left a marriage, or had their parole revoked. The parallel trends assumption that underpins difference-in-differences generally fails in such settings. We suggest identifying conditions that are analogous to those of difference-in-differences but apply to hazard rates rather than mean outcomes. These alternative assumptions motivate estimators that retain the simplicity and transparency of standard diff-in-diff, and we suggest analogous specification tests. Our approach can be adapted to general linear restrictions between the hazard rates of different groups, motivating duration analogues of the triple differences and synthetic control methods. We apply our procedures to examine the impact of a policy that increased the generosity of unemployment benefits, using a cross-cohort comparison.</description>

      <title>Demand and Welfare Analysis in Discrete Choice Models with Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-life settings of consumer-choice involve social interactions, causing targeted policies to have spillover-effects. This paper develops novel empirical tools for analyzing demand and welfare-effects of policy-interventions in binary choice settings with social interactions. Examples include subsidies for health-product adoption and vouchers for attending a high-achieving school. We establish the connection between econometrics of large games and Brock-Durlauf-type interaction models, under both I.I.D. and spatially correlated unobservables. We develop new convergence results for associated beliefs and estimates of preference-parameters under increasing-domain spatial asymptotics. Next, we show that even with fully parametric specifications and unique equilibrium, choice data, that are sufficient for counterfactual demand-prediction under interactions, are insufficient for welfare-calculations. This is because distinct underlying mechanisms producing the same interaction coefficient can imply different welfare-effects and deadweight-loss from a policy-intervention. Standard index-restrictions imply distribution-free bounds on welfare. We illustrate our results using experimental data on mosquito-net adoption in rural Kenya.</description>

      <title>The Local to Unity Dynamic Tobit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers highly persistent time series that are subject to nonlinearities in the form of censoring or an occasionally binding constraint, such as are regularly encountered in macroeconomics. A tractable candidate model for such series is the dynamic Tobit with a root local to unity. We show that this model generates a process that converges weakly to a non-standard limiting process, that is constrained (regulated) to be positive. Surprisingly, despite the presence of censoring, the OLS estimators of the model parameters are consistent. We show that this allows OLS-based inferences to be drawn on the overall persistence of the process (as measured by the sum of the autoregressive coefficients), and for the null of a unit root to be tested in the presence of censoring. Our simulations illustrate that the conventional ADF test substantially over-rejects when the data is generated by a dynamic Tobit with a unit root, whereas our proposed test is correctly sized. We provide an application of our methods to testing for a unit root in the Swiss franc / euro exchange rate, during a period when this was subject to an occasionally binding lower bound.</description>

      <title>Does regional variation in wage levels identify the effects of a national minimum wage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I evaluate the performance of estimators that exploit regional variation in wage levels to identify the employment and wage effects of national minimum wage laws. For the "effective minimum wage" design, I show that the identification assumptions in Lee (1999) are difficult to satisfy in settings without regional minimum wages. For the "fraction affected" design, I show that economic factors such as skill-biased technical change or regional convergence may cause parallel trends violations and should be investigated using pre-treatment data. I also show that this design is subject to misspecification biases that are not easily solved with changes in specification.</description>

      <title>Fixed-b Asymptotics for Panel Models with Two-Way Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a cluster robust variance estimator proposed by Chiang, Hansen and Sasaki (2024) for linear panels. First, we show algebraically that this variance estimator (CHS estimator, hereafter) is a linear combination of three common variance estimators: the one-way unit cluster estimator, the "HAC of averages" estimator, and the "average of HACs" estimator. Based on this finding, we obtain a fixed-b asymptotic result for the CHS estimator and corresponding test statistics as the cross-section and time sample sizes jointly go to infinity. Furthermore, we propose two simple bias-corrected versions of the variance estimator and derive the fixed-b limits. In a simulation study, we find that the two bias-corrected variance estimators along with fixed-b critical values provide improvements in finite sample coverage probabilities. We illustrate the impact of bias-correction and use of the fixed-b critical values on inference in an empirical example from Thompson (2011) on the relationship between industry profitability and market concentration.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Identification of Monetary Policy Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Bayesian heteroskedastic Markov-switching structural vector autoregression with data-driven time-varying identification. The model selects alternative exclusion restrictions over time and, as a condition for the search, allows to verify identification through heteroskedasticity within each regime. Based on four alternative monetary policy rules, we show that a monthly six-variable system supports time variation in US monetary policy shock identification. In the sample-dominating first regime, systematic monetary policy follows a Taylor rule extended by the term spread, effectively curbing inflation. In the second regime, occurring after 2000 and gaining more persistence after the global financial and COVID crises, it is characterized by a money-augmented Taylor rule. This regime's unconventional monetary policy provides economic stimulus, features the liquidity effect, and is complemented by a pure term spread shock. Absent the specific monetary policy of the second regime, inflation would be over one percentage point higher on average after 2008.</description>

      <title>Was Javert right to be suspicious? Unpacking treatment effect heterogeneity of alternative sentences on time-to-recidivism in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents new econometric tools to unpack the treatment effect heterogeneity of punishing misdemeanor offenses on time-to-recidivism. We show how one can identify, estimate, and make inferences on the distributional, quantile, and average marginal treatment effects in setups where the treatment selection is endogenous and the outcome of interest, usually a duration variable, is potentially right-censored. We explore our proposed econometric methodology to evaluate the effect of fines and community service sentences as a form of punishment on time-to-recidivism in the State of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010 and 2019, leveraging the as-if random assignment of judges to cases. Our results highlight substantial treatment effect heterogeneity that other tools are not meant to capture. For instance, we find that people whom most judges would punish take longer to recidivate as a consequence of the punishment, while people who would be punished only by strict judges recidivate at an earlier date than if they were not punished.</description>
