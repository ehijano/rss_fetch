      <title>Rate-Matching Deep Polar Codes via Polar Coded Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep polar codes are pre-transformed polar codes that employ a multi-layered polar kernel transformation strategy to enhance code performance in short blocklength regimes. However, like conventional polar codes, their block length is constrained to powers of two, as the final transformation layer uses a conventional polar kernel matrix. This paper introduces a novel rate-matching technique for deep polar codes using code extension, particularly effective when the desired code length slightly exceeds a power of two. The key idea is to exploit the layered structure of deep polar codes by concatenating polar codewords generated at each transformation layer. Based on this structure, we also develop an efficient decoding algorithm leveraging soft-output successive cancellation list decoding and provide comprehensive error probability analysis supporting our code design algorithms. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient greedy algorithm for multi-layer configurations. Extensive simulations confirm that our approach delivers substantial coding gains over conventional rate-matching methods, especially in medium to high code-rate regimes.</description>

      <title>Radio Map-Enabled 3D Trajectory and Communication Optimization for Low-Altitude Air-Ground Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy includes the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving ground robots. This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</description>

      <title>Multi-Terminal Remote Generation and Estimation Over a Broadcast Channel With Correlated Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multi-terminal remote estimation problem under a rate constraint, in which the goal of the encoder is to help each decoder estimate a function over a certain distribution -- while the distribution is known only to the encoder, the function to be estimated is known only to the decoders, and can also be different for each decoder. The decoders can observe correlated samples from prior distributions, instantiated through shared randomness with the encoder. To achieve this, we employ remote generation, where the encoder helps decoders generate samples from the underlying distribution by using the samples from the prior through importance sampling. While methods such as minimal random coding can be used to efficiently transmit samples to each decoder individually using their importance scores, it is unknown if the correlation among the samples from the priors can reduce the communication cost using the availability of a broadcast link. We propose a hierarchical importance sampling strategy that facilitates, in the case of non-zero G\'acs-K\"orner common information among the priors of the decoders, a common sampling step leveraging the availability of a broadcast channel. This is followed by a refinement step for the individual decoders. We present upper bounds on the bias and the estimation error for unicast transmission, which is of independent interest. We then introduce a method that splits into two phases, dedicated to broadcast and unicast transmission, respectively, and show the reduction in communication cost.</description>

      <title>Robust Movable-Antenna Position Optimization with Imperfect CSI for MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless channel conditions through local antenna movement within confined regions. Unlike previous works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), this letter addresses the robust MA position optimization problem under imperfect CSI conditions for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system. Specifically, we consider two types of CSI errors: norm-bounded and randomly distributed errors, aiming to maximize the worst-case and non-outage received signal power, respectively. For norm-bounded CSI errors, we derive the worst-case received signal power in closed-form. For randomly distributed CSI errors, due to the intractability of the probabilistic constraints, we apply the Bernstein-type inequality to obtain a closed-form lower bound for the non-outage received signal power. Based on these results, we show the optimality of the maximum-ratio transmission for imperfect CSI in both scenarios and employ a graph-based algorithm to obtain the optimal MA positions. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can even outperform other benchmark schemes implemented under perfect CSI conditions.</description>

      <title>Minimal Linear Codes Violating the Ashikhmin-Barg Condition from Arbitrary Projective Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there have been many constructions of minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition from Boolean functions, linear codes with few nonzero weights or partial difference sets. In this paper, we first give a general method to transform a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition to a minimal code violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give a construction of a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition from an arbitrary projective linear code. Hence an arbitrary projective linear code can be transformed to a minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give infinite many families of minimal codes violating the Ashikhamin-Barg condition. Weight distributions of constructed minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition in this paper are determined. Many minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition with their minimum weights close to the optimal or the best known minimum weights of linear codes are constructed in this paper. Moreover, many infinite families of self-orthogonal binary minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition are also given.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna architecture has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments and enhancing system performance. While prior research has primarily focused on sum-rate maximization or transmit power minimization of pinching-antenna systems, the critical aspect of energy efficiency (EE) has received limited attention. Given the increasing importance of EE in future wireless communication networks, this work investigates EE optimization in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-user pinching-antenna uplink system. The problem entails the joint optimization of the users' transmit power and the pinching-antenna position. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to tightly coupled variables. To tackle this, we employ an alternating optimization framework to decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one focusing on power allocation and the other on antenna positioning. A low-complexity optimal solution is derived for the power allocation subproblem, while the pinching-antenna positioning subproblem is addressed using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a high-quality near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms both conventional-antenna configurations and orthogonal multiple access-based pinching-antenna systems in terms of EE.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS) Aided Over-the-air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables fast data aggregation for edge intelligence applications. However the performance of AirComp can be severely degraded by channel misalignments. Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for physically reshaping favorable wireless channels to reduce misalignments and thus AirComp errors, via low-cost, fully passive, and highly reconfigurable antenna deployment. Motivated by these benefits, we propose a novel PASS-aided AirComp system that introduces new design degrees of freedom through flexible pinching antenna (PA) placement. To improve performance, we consider a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the PA position, transmit power, and decoding vector. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization based framework with Gauss-Seidel based PA position updates. Simulation results show that our proposed joint PA position and communication design significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes in AirComp accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Robust Design for BackCom Assisted Hybrid NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA) is inherently an enabler of massive machine type communications, a key use case for sixth-generation (6G) systems. Together with backscatter communication (BackCom), it seamlessly integrates with the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques to yield superior performance gains. In this paper, we study BackCom assisted H-NOMA uplink transmission with the aim of minimizing power with imperfect channel state information (CSI), where a generalized representation for channel estimation error models is used. The considered power minimization problem with aggregate data constraints is both non-convex and intractable. For the considered imperfect CSI models, we use Lagrange duality and the majorization-minimization principle to produce a conservative approximation of the original problem. The conservative formulation is relaxed by incorporating slack variables and a penalized objective. We solve the penalized tractable approximation using a provably convergent algorithm with polynomial complexity. Our results highlight that, despite being conservative, the proposed solution results in a similar power consumption as for the nominal power minimization problem without channel uncertainties. Additionally, robust H-NOMA is shown to almost always yield more power efficiency than the OMA case. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed solution is manifested by a high probability of feasibility of the robust design compared to the OMA and the nominal one.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel pinching-antenna-system (PASS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where multiple pinching antennas (PAs) are strategically activiated on a waveguide to facilitate information transmission to multiple information receivers (IRs) and power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously. Leveraging the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a high-precision element-wise algorithm and a low-complexity linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the position optimization sub-problem. The numerical results demonstrate that PAs assisted SWIPT can achieve a remarkable performance gain compared to conventional system.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Channel Estimation in OTFS Systems with Fractional Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation exploits the sparsity of Delay-Doppler domain channels, making it highly effective in high-mobility scenarios. Its accurate channel estimation supports integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The letter introduces a low-complexity technique for estimating delay and Doppler shifts under fractional effects, while addressing inter-path interference. The method employs a sequential estimation process combined with interference elimination based on energy leakage, ensuring accurate channel estimation. Furthermore, the estimated channel parameters can signifcantly improve ISAC system performance by enhancing sensing capabilities. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving accurate channel estimation and facilitating sensing tasks for ISAC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize exact, and approximate, optimality of games that players can interact with using quantum strategies. In comparison to a previous work of the author, arXiv: 2311.12887, which applied a 2016 framework due to Ostrev for constructing error bounds beyond CHSH and XOR games, in addition to the existence of well-posed semidefinite programs for determining primal feasible solutions, along with quantum-classical duality gaps, it continues to remain of interest to further develop the construction of error bounds, and related objects, to game-theoretic settings with several participants. In such settings, one encounters a rich information theoretic landscape, not only from the fact that there exists a significantly larger combinatorial space of possible strategies for each player, but also several opportunities for pronounced quantum advantage. We conclude this effort by describing other variants of other possible strategies, as proposed sources for quantum advantage, in $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetition variants of $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ games.</description>

      <title>Mixing and Merging Metric Spaces using Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X_1,d_1),\dots, (X_N,d_N)$ be metric spaces with respective distance functions $d_i: X_i \times X_i \rightarrow [0,1]$, $i=1,\dots,N$. Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the set theoretic product $X_1\times \cdots \times X_N$ and let $\mathbf{g} \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbf{h} \in \mathcal{X}$ denote two elements in this product space. Let $\mathcal{G} = \left(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\right)$ be a directed graph with vertices $\mathcal{V} =\{1,\dots, N\}$ and with a positive weight $\mathcal{P} = \{p_{ij}\}, p_{ij}\in (0, 1], i,j = 1,..,N$ associated with each edge $(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}$ of $\mathcal{G}$. We define the function \begin{align*} d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}) := \left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \prod_{i=1}^N \left[1- d_i(g_i,h_i)\right]^{\frac{1}{p_{ji}}} \right). \end{align*} In this paper we show that $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defines a metric space over $\mathcal{X}$ and we investigate the properties of this distance under graph operations, which includes disjoint unions and cartesian products. We show two limiting cases: (a) where $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defined over a finite field leads to a broad generalization of graph-based distances that is widely studied in the theory of error-correcting codes; and (b) where $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ is extended to measuring distances over graphons.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing applied to general distributed learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coded computing is one of the techniques that can be used for privacy protection in Federated Learning. However, most of the constructions used for coded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved are exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require quantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate Coded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect privacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for centralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and secure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging significantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy protection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used robustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a variety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of different learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational autoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new computing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less than a fraction of one bit per participant. Additionally, the computational cost of the encoding and decoding processes depends only of the degree of decentralization of the data.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO: A Deep Generative Model Guided by Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the near-field (NF) channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Considering the pronounced NF effects in XL-MIMO communications, we first establish a joint angle-distance (AD) domain-based spherical-wavefront physical channel model that captures the inherent sparsity of XL-MIMO channels. Leveraging the channel's sparsity in the joint AD domain, the CE is approached as a task of reconstructing sparse signals. Anchored in this framework, we first propose a compressed sensing algorithm to acquire a preliminary channel estimate. Harnessing the powerful implicit prior learning capability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), we further propose a GenAI-based approach to refine the estimated channel. Specifically, we introduce the preliminary estimated channel as side information, and derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-marginal distribution of the target NF channel conditioned on the preliminary estimated channel, which serves as the optimization objective for the proposed generative diffusion model (GDM). Additionally, we introduce a more generalized version of the GDM, the non-Markovian GDM (NM-GDM), to accelerate the sampling process, achieving an approximately tenfold enhancement in sampling efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of offering substantial performance gain in CE compared to existing benchmark schemes within NF XL-MIMO systems. Furthermore, our approach exhibits enhanced generalization capabilities in both the NF or far-field (FF) regions.</description>

      <title>Source Anonymity for Private Random Walk Decentralized Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user. The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.</description>

      <title>Compression, Regularity, Randomness and Emergent Structure: Rethinking Physical Complexity in the Data-Driven Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual organization of these measures is still missing.
  We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity) and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing their computational accessibility and approximability.
  This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders, latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems.
  We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.</description>

      <title>The generalized trifference problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding the largest number $T(n, m)$ of ternary vectors of length $n$ such that for any three distinct vectors there are at least $m$ coordinates where they pairwise differ.
  For $m = 1$, this is the classical trifference problem which is wide open.
  We prove upper and lower bounds on $T(n, m)$ for various ranges of the parameter $m$ and determine the phase transition threshold on $m=m(n)$ where $T(n, m)$ jumps from constant to exponential in $n$.
  By relating the linear version of this problem to a problem on blocking sets in finite geometry, we give explicit constructions and probabilistic lower bounds.
  We also compute the exact values of this function and its linear variation for small parameters.</description>

      <title>Schrijver's $\vartheta$-function is not an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph: a counterexample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note addresses an open question concerning a variant of the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function, introduced by Schrijver and independently by McEliece et al. (1978). It provides a complete and detailed presentation of a counterexample demonstrating that this variant does not universally upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph, in contrast to the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function. The counterexample, previously introduced in Example 5.24 of a recent paper by the author, entitled: Observations on graph invariants with the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function (AIMS Mathematics, vol. 9, pp. 15385--15468, April 2024, https://doi.org/10.3934/math.2024747), is revisited and fully detailed here. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16063v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider channels with synchronization errors modeled as insertions and deletions. A classical result for such channels is their information stability, hence the existence of the Shannon capacity, when the synchronization errors are memoryless. In this paper, we extend this result to the case where the insertions and deletions have memory. Specifically, we assume that the synchronization errors are governed by a stationary and ergodic finite state Markov chain, and prove that such channel is information-stable, which implies the existence of a coding scheme which achieves the limit of mutual information. This result implies the existence of the Shannon capacity for a wide range of channels with synchronization errors, with different applications including DNA storage. The methods developed may also be useful to prove other coding theorems for non-trivial channel sequences.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Approach to Avoiding Weak Keys in the BIKE Cryptosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE) is a code-based cryptosystem that was considered in Round 4 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process. It is based on quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check (QC-MDPC) codes paired with an iterative decoder. While (low-density) parity-check codes have been shown to perform well in practice, their capabilities are governed by the code's graphical representation and the choice of decoder rather than the traditional code parameters, making it difficult to determine the decoder failure rate (DFR). Moreover, decoding failures have been demonstrated to lead to attacks that recover the BIKE private key. In this paper, we demonstrate a strong correlation between weak keys and $4$-cycles in their associated Tanner graphs. We give concrete ways to enumerate the number of 4-cycles in a BIKE key and use these results to present a filtering algorithm that will filter BIKE keys with large numbers of 4-cycles. These results also apply to more general parity check codes.</description>

      <title>Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</description>

      <title>Capacity Approximations for Insertion Channels with Small Insertion Probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channels with synchronization errors, exhibiting deletion and insertion errors, find practical applications in DNA storage, data reconstruction, and various other domains. Presence of insertions and deletions render the channel with memory, complicating capacity analysis. For instance, despite the formulation of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel more than fifty years ago, and proof that the channel is information stable, hence its Shannon capacity exists, calculation of the capacity remained elusive. However, a relatively recent result establishes the capacity of the deletion channel in the asymptotic regime of small deletion probabilities by computing the dominant terms of the capacity expansion. This paper extends that result to binary insertion channels, determining the dominant terms of the channel capacity for small insertion probabilities and establishing capacity in this asymptotic regime. Specifically, we consider two i.i.d. insertion channel models: insertion channel with possible random bit insertions after every transmitted bit and the Gallager insertion model, for which a bit is replaced by two random bits with a certain probability. To prove our results, we build on methods used for the deletion channel, employing Bernoulli(1/2) inputs for achievability and coupling this with a converse using stationary and ergodic processes as inputs, and show that the channel capacity differs only in the higher order terms from the achievable rates with i.i.d. inputs. The results, for instance, show that the capacity of the random insertion channel is higher than that of the Gallager insertion channel, and quantifies the difference in the asymptotic regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.</description>

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Earth's orbit due to growing satellite deployments and space debris poses a significant challenge to sustainable space operations. Traditional space surveillance systems rely on centralized architectures, which introduce single points of failure and scalability constraints. This paper proposes a blockchain-based solution where satellites function as nodes with distinct roles to validate and securely store debris-tracking data. Simulation results indicate that optimal network performance is achieved with approximately 30 nodes, balancing throughput and response time, representing an approximately 9x improvement over traditional consensus mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning discrete distributions from i.i.d. samples is a well-understood problem. However, advances in generative machine learning prompt an interesting new, non-i.i.d. setting: after receiving a certain number of samples, an estimated distribution is fixed, and samples from this estimate are drawn and introduced into the sample corpus, undifferentiated from real samples. Subsequent generations of estimators now face contaminated environments, a scenario referred to in the machine learning literature as self-consumption. Empirically, it has been observed that models in fully synthetic self-consuming loops collapse -- their performance deteriorates with each batch of training -- but accumulating data has been shown to prevent complete degeneration. This, in turn, begs the question: What happens when fresh real samples \textit{are} added at every stage? In this paper, we study the minimax loss of self-consuming discrete distribution estimation in such loops. We show that even when model collapse is consciously averted, the ratios between the minimax losses with and without source information can grow unbounded as the batch size increases. In the data accumulation setting, where all batches of samples are available for estimation, we provide minimax lower bounds and upper bounds that are order-optimal under mild conditions for the expected $\ell_2^2$ and $\ell_1$ losses at every stage. We provide conditions for regimes where there is a strict gap in the convergence rates compared to the corresponding oracle-assisted minimax loss where real and synthetic samples are differentiated, and provide examples where this gap is easily observed. We also provide a lower bound on the minimax loss in the data replacement setting, where only the latest batch of samples is available, and use it to find a lower bound for the worst-case loss for bounded estimate trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>

Abstract: An integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) design for pinching antenna systems (PASS) is proposed, where the pinching antennas are deployed to establish reliable line-of-sight communication and sensing links. More particularly, a separated ISAC design is proposed for the two-waveguide PASS, where one waveguide is used to emit the information-bearing signals for ISAC transmission while the other waveguide is used to receive the reflected echo signals. Based on this framework, a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the illumination power as well as ensure the communication quality-of-service requirement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed PASS-ISAC scheme outperforms the conventional antenna scheme.</description>

Abstract: DNA synthesis is considered as one of the most expensive components in current DNA storage systems. In this paper, focusing on a common synthesis machine, which generates multiple DNA strands in parallel following a fixed supersequence,we propose constrained codes with polynomial-time encoding and decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing works, our codes simultaneously satisfy both l-runlength limited and {\epsilon}-balanced constraints. By enumerating all valid sequences, our codes achieve the maximum rate, matching the capacity. Additionally, we design constrained error-correcting codes capable of correcting one insertion or deletion in the obtained DNA sequence while still adhering to the constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Insertion Channels for Small Insertion Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channels with synchronization errors, such as deletion and insertion errors, are crucial in DNA storage, data reconstruction, and other applications. These errors introduce memory to the channel, complicating its capacity analysis. This paper analyzes binary insertion channels for small insertion probabilities, identifying dominant terms in the capacity expansion and establishing capacity in this regime. Using Bernoulli(1/2) inputs for achievability and a converse based on the use of stationary and ergodic processes, we demonstrate that capacity closely aligns with achievable rates using independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) inputs, differing only in higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Simple Finite-Length Achievability and Converse Bounds for the Deletion Channel and the Insertion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop upper bounds on code size for independent and identically distributed deletion (insertion) channel for given code length and target frame error probability. The bounds are obtained as a variation of a general converse bound, which, though available for any channel, is inefficient and not easily computable without a good reference distribution over the output alphabet. We obtain a reference output distribution for a general finite-input finite-output channel and provide a simple formula for the converse bound on the capacity employing this distribution. We then evaluate the bound for the deletion channel with a finite block length and show that the resulting upper bound on the code side is tighter than that for a binary erasure channel, which is the only alternative converse bound for this finite-length setting. Also, we provide the similar results for the insertion channel.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication, and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures with negligible WSR performance loss.</description>

      <title>A proof of P != NP (New symmetric encryption algorithm against any linear attacks and differential attacks)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P vs NP problem is the most important unresolved problem in the field of computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of algorithm design, especially in the field of cryptography. The security of cryptographic algorithms based on short keys depends on whether P is equal to NP. In fact, Shannon[1] strictly proved that the one-time-pad system meets unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in practice. Cryptography algorithms used in practice are all based on short key, and the security of the short key mechanism is ultimately based on "one-way" assumption, that is, it is assumed that a one-way function exists. In fact, the existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P != NP. In this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space can satisfy the plaintext-ciphertext pair, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing short-key cipher algorithms. Based on the above feature, we construct a problem and theoretically prove that the problem satisfies the properties of one-way functions, thereby solving the problem of the existence of one-way functions, that is, directly proving that P != NP.</description>

      <title>Concrete Quantum Channels and Algebraic Structure of Abstract Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article analyzes the algebraic structure of the set of all quantum channels and its subset consisting of quantum channels that have Holevo representation. The regularity of these semigroups under composition of mappings is analyzed. It is also known that these sets are compact convex sets and, therefore, rich in geometry. An attempt is made to identify generalized invertible channels and also the idempotent channels. When channels are of the Holevo type, these two problems are fully studied in this article. The motivation behind this study is its applicability to the reversibility of channel transformations and recent developments in resource-destroying channels, which are idempotents. This is related to the coding-encoding problem in quantum information theory. Several examples are provided, with the main examples coming from pre-conditioner maps which assign preconditioners to matrices in numerical linear algebra. Thus, the known pre-conditioner maps are viewed as quantum channels in finite dimensions. In addition, the infinite-dimensional analogue of preconditioners is introduced and certain limit theorems are discussed; this is with an aim to analyze asymptotic methods in quantum channels analogous to problems in asymptotic linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression Codes for Non-coherent SIMO channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by hyper-reliable low-latency communication in 6G, we consider error control coding for short block lengths in multi-antenna fading channels. In general, the channel fading coefficients are unknown at both the transmitter and receiver, which is referred to as non-coherent channels. Conventionally, pilot symbols are transmitted to facilitate channel estimation, causing power and bandwidth overhead. Our paper considers sparse regression codes (SPARCs) for non-coherent flat-fading channels without using pilots. We develop a novel greedy decoder for SPARC using maximum likelihood principles, referred to as maximum likelihood matching pursuit (MLMP). MLMP works based on successive combining principles as opposed to conventional greedy algorithms, which are based on successive cancellation. We also obtain the noiseless perfect recovery condition for our successive combining algorithm. In addition, we develop an approximate message passing (AMP) SPARC decoder for the non-coherent flat fading model. Using simulation studies, we show that the MLMP decoder for SPARC outperforms AMP and other greedy decoders. Also, SPARC with MLMP decoder outperforms polar codes employing pilot-based channel estimation and polar codes with non-coherent decoders.</description>

      <title>Information Theory Strikes Back: New Development in the Theory of Cardinality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the cardinality of the output of a query is a fundamental problem in database query processing.
  In this article, we overview a recently published contribution that casts the cardinality estimation problem as linear optimization and computes guaranteed upper bounds on the cardinality of the output for any full conjunctive query. The objective of the linear program is to maximize the joint entropy of the query variables and its constraints are the Shannon information inequalities and new information inequalities involving $\ell_p$-norms of the degree sequences of the join attributes.
  The bounds based on arbitrary norms can be asymptotically lower than those based on the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ norms, which capture the cardinalities and respectively the max-degrees of the input relations. They come with a matching query evaluation algorithm, are computable in exponential time in the query size, and are provably tight when each degree sequence is on one join attribute.</description>

      <title>The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram matrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.</description>

      <title>ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while also achieving faster convergence.</description>

      <title>LLM-Text Watermarking based on Lagrange Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML-powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text -- either to the specific language model that produced it or to the individual user who embedded their identity via a so-called multi-bit watermark. This capability is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this challenge is digital watermarking.
  This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, enabling the recovery of a multi-bit author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points $(x, f(x))$ that lie on a single straight line. The $x$-coordinates are computed pseudorandomly using a cryptographic hash function $H$ applied to the concatenation of the previous token's identity and a secret key $s_k$. Crucially, the $x$-coordinates do not need to be embedded into the text -- only the corresponding $f(x)$ values are embedded. During extraction, the algorithm recovers the original points along with many spurious ones, forming an instance of the Maximum Collinear Points (MCP) problem, which can be solved efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity even when as few as three genuine points remain after adversarial manipulation.</description>
