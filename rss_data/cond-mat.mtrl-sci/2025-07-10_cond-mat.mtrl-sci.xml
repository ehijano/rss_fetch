      <title>Terahertz field-induced metastable magnetization near criticality in FePS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge density waves. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the N\'eel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states.</description>

      <title>Tuning of electronic properties in highly lattice-mismatched epitaxial SmN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the electronic properties of epitaxial SmN thin films can be effectively tuned during growth by controlling the synthesis parameters. By carefully adjusting these parameters, we are able to drive SmN from an insulating ferromagnetic state to a ferromagnetic metallic state. However, no signatures of previously reported superconductivity were observed down to 0.35 K, even in the most conductive samples. We discuss possible scenarios for the absence of superconductivity in these films and examine implications for the underlying pairing mechanism in this material. These findings open a new pathway for the epitaxial engineering of multifunctional materials, enabling the monolithic integration of diverse electronic phases, such as ferromagnetism and metallicity, without the lattice mismatch and strain typically associated with heteroepitaxial growth of dissimilar materials.</description>

      <title>Hot Phonon Bottlenecks and the Role of Non-Equilibrium Acoustic Phonons in III-V Multi-Quantum Well Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot phonon bottleneck effect is a promising mechanism for the realization of a true hot carrier solar cell. Prior work has assumed that the acoustic phonons created via decay of polar longitudinal optical (LO) phonons are assumed to quickly leave the system or thermalize quickly due to multi-phonon processes. The present work furthers the models of previous work to include a build-up of longitudinal acoustic phonons in addition to LO phonons due via the Klemens process. By including this additional process, nonphysical assumptions concerning the LO anharmonic lifetime are no longer required, resulting in a better explanation of the experimental results, and pointing towards new approaches in achieving high carrier temperatures during photo-excitation.</description>

      <title>High Proton Conductivity of HxWO3 at Intermediate Temperatures: Unlocking Its Application as a Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen tungsten bronzes (HxWO3), known for their mixed protonic-electronic conduction near room temperature, are extensively studied for electrochromic and gasochromic applications. However, their proton transport properties at elevated temperatures, particularly in the intermediate-temperature range (200-500 {\deg}C), remain unexplored. This study revealed the proton transport behavior of HxWO3, focusing on its potential as a proton-conducting mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) for intermediate-temperature electrochemical applications. By employing a proton-conducting phosphate glass as an electron-blocking electrode, we selectively measured the partial proton conductivity of sintered HxWO3. Hydrogen incorporation into the sintered WO3 pellet was found to occur preferentially near the surface, forming an approximately 500-micrometer-thick hydrogen-rich region. This region reached a composition of x = 0.24 and exhibited proton conductivity exceeding 10^-1 S/cm at 275 {\deg}C, well above those of state-of-the-art perovskite proton conductors. Impedance spectroscopy revealed distinct features of proton transport, including an isotope effect. The proton diffusion coefficient was 100-1000 times greater than that of H0.0001TiO2, which exhibits mixed protonic-electronic conduction via hydrogen dissolution. The larger proton diffusion coefficient of H0.24WO3 suggests that large polaron formation enhances proton mobility.These findings unlock new functionality of HxWO3 as a MIEC in the intermediate-temperature range, paving the way for the development of next-generation hydrogen energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of persistent photoconductivity in surface conducting hydrogenated diamond films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The p-type surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond (HD) has opened up new possibilities for the development of diamond-based electronic devices. However, the origin of the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) observed in surface-conducting HD remains unclear, an understanding that is crucial for advancing HD-based optoelectronic technologies. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism of PPC in surface-conducting HD films. A systematic analysis was performed by tuning the carrier density via partial oxygen termination using an ozonation process. With increasing O-termination, both the decay time and the recombination barrier of photoexcited electron-hole pairs were found to decrease significantly, from 232 to 5 seconds, and from ~ 150 to 54 meV, respectively. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that PPC in HD is influenced by random local potential fluctuations, which delay the recombination of photoexcited carriers. Furthermore, the observed PPC behavior is closely associated with percolative transport processes within the HD film. Importantly, the dependence of PPC on sheet carrier density is correlated with Coulomb interactions between the two-dimensional hole gas and the surface adsorbate layer. This study offers new insights into the PPC mechanism in surface-conducting HD films, contributing to the broader understanding necessary for the design of advanced diamond-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Magnetism, Sliding Ferroelectricity, and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effects in a Multiferroic Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials offer a promising platform for exploring novel couplings between altermagnetic (AM) spin-splitting and magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), with potential applications in next-generation quantum technologies. In this work, first-principles calculations, symmetry analysis, and kp modeling are employed to demonstrate how interlayer sliding in AFM multiferroic bilayers enables engineering of the electronic, magnetic, and magneto-optical properties. This study reveals an unprecedented dimension-driven AM crossover, where the 2D paraelectric (PE) bilayer exhibits spin-degenerate bands protected by the [C2||Mc] spin-space symmetry, while the 3D counterpart manifests AM spin-splitting along kz not equal to 0 paths. Furthermore, interlayer sliding breaks the Mc symmetry and stabilizes a ferroelectric (FE) state characterized by compensated ferrimagnetism and a Zeeman effect, which produces non-relativistic spin-split bands. In the FE phase, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts accidental degeneracies, creating `alternating' spin-polarized bands due to the interplay of Zeeman and Rashba effects. Crucially, the spin polarization, ferro-valley polarization, and Kerr angle are simultaneously reversible by switching either interlayer sliding or the Neel vector. These findings highlight the rich coupling between electronic, magnetic, and optical orders in sliding multiferroics, thereby paving the way for ultra-low-power spintronics and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Phase Retrieval of Highly Strained Bragg Coherent Diffraction Patterns using Supervised Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), Phase Retrieval of highly strained crystals is often challenging with standard iterative algorithms. This computational obstacle limits the potential of the technique as it precludes the reconstruction of physically interesting highly-strained particles. Here, we propose a novel approach to this problem using a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on 3D simulated diffraction data to predict the corresponding reciprocal space phase. This method allows to fully exploit the potential of the CNN by mapping functions within the same space and leveraging structural similarities between input and output. The final object is obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the retrieved complex diffracted amplitude and is then further refined with iterative algorithms. We demonstrate that our model outperforms standard algorithms on highly strained simulated data not included in the training set, as well as on experimental data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Analysis of Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in All Point Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry analysis provides crucial insights into the magnetoelectric coupling effect in type-II multiferroics. In this Letter, we comprehensively investigate couplings between electric polarization and inhomogeneous magnetization across all 32 crystallographic point groups using a phenomenological Landau theory. Our theory successfully explains the ferroelectric polarizations in all known type-II multiferroics characterized by incommensurate magnetic orders. In addition, we predict 12 promising type-II multiferroic candidates with the highest magnetic transition temperature of 84 K through systematic screening of MAGNDATA database. Furthermore, we find that the collinear spin-sinusoidal texture emerges as a previously unrecognized source of ferroelectric polarization. We also demonstrate that topological ferroelectric vortex states can be induced by ferromagnetic vortex configurations in uniaxial point groups, opening a route to realizing coexisting multiple-vortex states in multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-assisted phase switching for crystal phase quantum dot fabrication in GaAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of several crystal phases within nanostructures of a single material presents both challenges and opportunities. While unintended phase mixing can degrade optoelectronic performances, deliberate control of polytypism enables novel heterostructures with unique quantum properties, crystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs). However, since tailoring the formation of CPQDs is difficult, applications remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-driven crystal phase switching in GaAs nanowires during vapor-liquid-solid growth, enabling precise control of crystal phases and creations of CPQDs with monolayer precision. Nanowires are epitaxially grown on custom-made silicon micro-substrates using chemical vapor deposition within an in-situ TEM. Real-time imaging reveals that the electric field switches instantaneously the crystal phase between zinc blende and wurtzite, creating atomically sharp interfaces. Numerical simulations are developed to investigate the impact of the electric field on the catalyst droplet geometry, which largely governs the crystal phase. This constitutes a key progress towards unlocking the potential of CPQDs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the convergence properties of a collection of iterative electron ptychography methods, under low electron doses ($&lt;$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$) and gives particular attention to the impact of the user-defined update strengths. We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Dependent Spin Pumping in YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin pumping efficiency in YIG/YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ bilayers by measuring the thickness dependence of both the YIG and WTi layers using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. The deposition of a 5-nm WTi layer leads to enhanced Gilbert damping in thinner YIG films, indicating efficient spin current injection. From the spin pumping contribution to the damping of the YIG/WTi bilayer, we determine an effective spin mixing conductance of $ 3.3 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for the 5-nm WTi layer. Further measurements with varying WTi thickness reveal a non-monotonic dependence of spin mixing conductance, peaking at $ 4.2 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for a 3-nm WTi layer. This behavior is attributed to a structural phase transition from the high-spin--orbit $ \beta $-phase to the less efficient $ \alpha $-phase in thicker WTi layers. Furthermore, comparative analysis with YIG/W bilayers shows that Ti doping significantly reduces $ g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} $. These findings highlight the critical role of alloy composition and structural phase in tuning spin transport for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Wannierization including magnetization and spin-orbit coupling via projectability disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) are widely employed as an essential tool for calculating the physical properties of materials due to their localized nature and computational efficiency. Projectability-disentangled Wannier functions (PDWFs) have recently emerged as a reliable and efficient approach for automatically constructing MLWFs that span both occupied and lowest unoccupied bands. Here, we extend the applicability of PDWFs to magnetic systems and/or those including spin-orbit coupling, and implement such extensions in automated workflows. Furthermore, we enhance the robustness and reliability of constructing PDWFs by defining an extended protocol that automatically expands the projectors manifold, when required, by introducing additional appropriate hydrogenic atomic orbitals. We benchmark our extended protocol on a set of 200 chemically diverse materials, as well as on the 40 systems with the largest band distance obtained with the standard PDWF approach, showing that on our test set the present approach delivers a 100% success rate in obtaining accurate Wannier-function interpolations, i.e., an average band distance below 15 meV between the DFT and Wannier-interpolated bands, up to 2 eV above the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Self-induced Floquet states via three-wave processes in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism for self-induced Floquet states involving acoustic and optical modes in synthetic antiferromagnets. By driving optical modes off-resonantly with radiofrequency fields in the canted antiferromagnetic state, limit cycles arising from the predator-prey dynamics of the acoustic and optical mode populations can appear. The cyclic growth and decay of these mode populations induce a time-periodic modulation of the canted state, which subsequently generates Floquet states. These states appear as a rich frequency comb in the power spectrum of magnetization oscillations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Machine-Learned Force Fields (MLFFs) trained on approximate Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Coupled Cluster (CC) level potential energy surfaces for the carbon diamond and lithium hydride solids. We assess the accuracy and precision of the MLFFs by calculating phonon dispersions and vibrational densities of states (VDOS) that are compared to experiment and reference ab initio results. To overcome limitations from long-range effects and the lack of atomic forces in the CC training data, a delta-learning approach based on the difference between CC and DFT results is explored. Compared to DFT, MLFFs trained on CC theory yield higher vibrational frequencies for optical modes, agreeing better with experiment. Furthermore, the MLFFs are used to estimate anharmonic effects on the VDOS of lithium hydride at the level of CC theory.</description>

      <title>3D atomic structure determination with ultrashort-pulse MeV electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure at the atomic scale is fundamental for the development of materials with improved properties. Compared to other probes providing atomic resolution, electrons offer the strongest interaction in combination with minimal radiation damage. Here, we report the successful implementation of MeV electron diffraction for ab initio 3D structure determination at atomic resolution. Using ultrashort electron pulses from the REGAE accelerator, we obtained high-quality diffraction data from muscovite and $1T-TaS_2$, enabling structure refinements according to the dynamical scattering theory and the accurate determination of hydrogen atom positions. The increased penetration depth of MeV electrons allows for structure determination from samples significantly thicker than those typically applicable in electron diffraction. These findings establish MeV electron diffraction as a viable approach for investigating a broad range of materials, including nanostructures and radiation-sensitive compounds, and open up new opportunities for in-situ and time-resolved experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergent Multiferroic Altermagnets and Spin Control via Noncollinear Molecular Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, with spin splitting and vanishing magnetization, have been attributed to many fascinating phenomena and potential applications. In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention. However, its experimental realization and precise spin manipulation remain elusive. Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Probing microsecond dynamics of disperse nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces using nanometer localization precision total-internal-reflection dark-field microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles at fluid-fluid interfaces have a wide range of important applications in industry, technology and science. Questions remain about what governs adsorption dynamics and inter-particle interactions, and how mixtures -- both of different-sized particles, and particles and surfactants -- behave. I probe the dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces using high-speed total-internal-reflection dark-field (TIR-DF) microscopy, comparing gold particles of diameters 20, 40 and 80 nanometers, and investigating the effect of an added surfactant. I built a TIR-DF microscope with a spatiotemporal resolution of up to 1 nanometer at 20 microseconds, and characterized the particle motion by direct imaging for the diffusive motion within the interfacial plane, and attenuation of light scattering and in-plane motion for out-of-plane motion. The addition of surfactant was found to qualitatively alter the interaction between the particles and the interface: Adsorptions became reversible and the size trend in diffusivity was reversed (larger particles diffused faster than smaller ones). The combination of this and the rarity of adsorption events of larger particles leads me to propose size-dependent barriers to adsorption at surfactant interfaces. In addition, at surfactant interfaces, many particles' diffusive behavior changed over the course of a trajectory, indicating several different immersion states that are stable on the experimental timescale (approximately 1 second). This study shows that there remain qualitatively new dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces to be explored. These dynamics can only be resolved at a high spatial resolution, and many of them only at high imaging speed, underlining the importance of novel imaging approaches probing the barriers of achievable spatiotemporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Structure and Dynamics in Molecular Liquids: Insights from Pressure Experiments and Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overall goal of this thesis is to investigate the connection between the dynamics and structure of molecular glass formers, by testing different scaling laws for both. The inspiration for this work is the Isomorph theory because it predicts a connection between structure and dynamics. The fundamental prediction of the Isomorph Theory is that there exist lines in the phase diagram where both structure and dynamics are invariant when presented in reduced units. The prediction of constant dynamics has been tested and confirmed experimentally several times, but the structural prediction has never been confirmed experimentally. In this thesis, we have investigated the structural prediction for liquids where the prediction of constant dynamics has been shown experimentally.</description>

      <title>Thermal Transport and Application Reassessment of ThSi$_2$N$_4$ Monolayer: From FET Channel to Thermoelectric Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional M$_2$Z$_4$ materials are proposed as suitable replacements for silicon channels in field-effect transistors (FETs). In the present work, the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer from the family, with the very appropriate electron mobility, is thermally investigated using the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The reliability of the MOSFET with the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ channel has been reassessed and determined to be low due to the high maximum temperature achieved. The phonon analysis is performed and reveals that the dominant contribution of fast and energetic LA and also slow and low energy ZA phonons alongside the minor participation of the TA phonons is responsible for the peak temperature rise reaching 800 K. This finding presents that the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer is not a good candidate for replacing as silicon channel but alternatively is capable of generating a significant temperature gradient, which makes it, a suitable candidate for using as a thermoelectric material in thermoelectric generators.</description>

      <title>Bilayer graphene as a template for manufacturing novel 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent intensive research on two-dimensional materials (2DMs) rekindle the interest in the intercalation of various atoms and molecules into layered compounds as a tool to manufacture 2DMs and tune their optoelectronic, magnetic and catalytic properties. Intercalation into free-standing bilayer graphene (BLG) has received special attention, as graphene is stable, chemically inert and enables one to study the atomic structure of the intercalated 2DM using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was also discovered that the protecting action of graphene sheets makes it possible to not only stabilize the encapsulated single sheets of marginally stable layered materials, but also synthesize completely new 2D systems inside BLG, which in comparison to the bulk graphite allows for easier intercalation and much larger increase in the inter-layer separation of the sheets. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in this area, with a special focus on new materials created inside BLG. We compare the experimental findings to the theoretical predictions, pay special attention to the discrepancies and outline the challenges in the field. Finally, we discuss unique opportunities offered by the intercalation into 2DMs beyond graphene and their heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Material realization of spinless, covalent-type Dirac semimetals in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realization of a three-dimensional (3D) analogue of graphene has been a central challenge in topological materials science. Graphene is stabilized by covalent bonding unlike conventional spin-orbit type 3D Dirac semimetals (DSMs). In this study, we demonstrate the material realization of covalent-type 3D DSMs $R_8$Co$X_3$ stabilized by covalent bonding. We observe that the carrier mobility $\mu$ of Dirac fermions reaches 3,000$\,\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$ even in polycrystalline samples, and $\mu$ increases with the inverse of the Fermi energy, evidencing significant contributions to charge transport from Dirac electrons. $R_8$Co$X_3$ provides a material platform for exploration of Dirac electrons in three dimensions with wide chemical tunability.</description>

      <title>Real-space understanding of electron-phonon coupling in superconducting hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is at the origin of conventional superconductivity, enabling the pairing of electrons into Cooper pairs. The electron-phonon matrix elements depend on the electronic eigenstates and, in the standard linear approximation, on the first derivative of the potential felt by the electrons with respect to ionic perturbations. Here, we focus on the derivatives of the potential with a twofold aim: to assess their contribution to the overall coupling and to analyze the limitations of neglecting higher-order derivatives. Several real-space functions are proposed to do the analysis, and are computed for some well-known superconductors. Our results show that, in hydrides, the derivatives of the potential tend to be larger in regions of high electron localization, explaining the success of electronic descriptors previously described to correlate with the critical temperature. The new functions introduced here are able to tell apart structures with similar types of bonding but very different critical temperatures, such as H3S and H3Se Im-3m phases, where electronic descriptors alone fail. Interestingly, our descriptors are capable of easily estimating the impact of higher-order terms in the electron-phonon coupling. In fact, we capture the limitations of the linear approximation expected for PdH, and predict an even more important non-linear behavior in LaH10.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Anatomy of Electron Angular Momenta Edge Accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for our understanding of current induced torques.</description>

Abstract: Integrating external heat into electrolysers can reduce the electrical power demand for carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Efficient operation requires detailed models that incorporate heat availability and its effect on startup costs. This paper advances existing operational models by endogenously modelling startup costs and direct heat integration, based on a piecewise linear approximation of the electrochemical equations. We analyse the impact of low- and high-temperature heat integration on the efficiency and profitability of hydrogen production for solid oxide and proton exchange membrane electrolysis technologies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of High-Temperature Charge Order and Time-Reversal Symmetry-Breaking in the Kagome Superconductor YRu3Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of high-temperature unconventional charge order and superconductivity in kagome quantum materials is pivotal for deepening our understanding of geometrically frustrated and correlated electron systems, and for harnessing their exotic properties in future quantum technologies. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkably rich phase diagram in the kagome superconductor YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, uncovered through a unique combination of muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), magnetotransport, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study reveals the emergence of a charge-ordered state with a propagation vector of (1/2, 0, 0), setting a record onset temperature of 800 K for such an order in a kagome system and for quantum materials more broadly. In addition, we observe time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking below $T_{2}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 25 K and field-induced magnetism below $T_{1}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 90 K, indicating the presence of a hidden magnetic state. These transitions are mirrored in the magnetoresistance data, which show a clear onset at ${\sim}$ $T_{1}^{*}$ and a pronounced increase below ${\sim}$ $T_{2}^{*}$, ultimately reaching a maximum magnetoresistance of 45${\%}$. Band structure calculations identify two van Hove singularities (VHSs) near the Fermi level, one of which resides within a flat band, suggesting a strong interplay between electronic correlations and emergent orders. At low temperatures, we find bulk superconductivity below $T_{\rm c}$ = 3.4 K, characterized by a pairing symmetry with either two isotropic full gaps or an anisotropic nodeless gap. Together, our findings point to a coexistence of high-temperature charge order, tunable magnetism, and multigap superconductivity in YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, positioning it as a compelling platform for exploring correlated kagome physics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Driven Anomalous Inverse Orbital Hall Effect in Fe Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the anomalous orbital effects in iron (Fe) films with strong uniaxial anisotropy, highlighting the interactions between spin and orbital currents. Using heterogeneous YIG/Fe and YIG/Pt/Fe structures, fabricated by oblique deposition in a magnetic field, spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) measurements were performed. It was observed that the uniaxial anisotropy enables the emergence of spin-to-charge (AISHE) and orbital-to-charge (AIOHE) conversion signals in out-of-plane configurations, where the spin polarization is parallel to the direction of the spin current. Experimental analysis revealed that orbital dynamics, mediated by orbital Hall conductivity, are more prominent in Fe films due to the low spin-orbit interaction (SOC) and high orbital response. These findings provide fundamental insights for the advancement of orbitronics devices, indicating the potential for controlling orbital and spin currents through magnetic and anisotropic parameters.</description>

      <title>Compressibility of Confined Fluids from Volume Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their properties deviate from bulk. These include bulk modulus, or compressibility, which determines the mechanical properties of fluid-saturated porous solids. Such properties are of importance for exploration and recovery of coal-bed methane and shale gas. We developed a new molecular simulation method for calculating compressibility of confined fluids, and applied it to methane in carbon nanopores. The method is based on volume fluctuations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, made possible through integrated potentials. Our method is one order of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo approach, and allows calculations for pore sizes up to 100 nm. Our simulations predicted an increase in the fluid bulk modulus by a factor of 4 in 3 nm slit pores, and showed a gradual decrease with the increase of the pore size, so that at 100 nm, the deviation from the bulk is less than 5%.</description>

      <title>Unified description of thermal and nonthermal hot carriers in plasmonic photocatalysis</title>

Abstract: The damping of surface plasmons generates hot carriers, which holds promise for photoelectric conversion and photocatalysis. Recent studies have revealed the nonequilibrium characters of the plasmonic hot carriers and their nonadiabatic coupling to molecular vibrations. Yet, the precise mechanism of plasmonic photocatalysis remains elusive and controversial. Here, we present a unified description of thermal and nonthermal hot carriers in the dynamics of vibrational excitation and photodissocation, where a quantitative comparison between the two mechanisms can be made. We revisit a well-studied system, O$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoparticles. The nonthermal hot carriers are found to promote molecular dissociation in the low-temperature or high-intensity regime. With increasing laser intensity, the dissociation rate exhibits a transition from a linear to nonlinear dependence due to the onset of vibrational heating as observed in experiment. Our model provides a unified framework to understand the mechanism and dynamics of photocatalysis and reveals the nonthermal pathways for energy harvesting and conversion with surface plasmons.</description>

      <title>Less can be more for predicting properties with large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting properties from coordinate-category data -- sets of vectors paired with categorical information -- is fundamental to computational science. In materials science, this challenge manifests as predicting properties like formation energies or elastic moduli from crystal structures comprising atomic positions (vectors) and element types (categorical information). While large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to such tasks, with researchers encoding structural data as text, optimal strategies for achieving reliable predictions remain elusive. Here, we report fundamental limitations in LLM's ability to learn from coordinate information in coordinate-category data. Through systematic experiments using synthetic datasets with tunable coordinate and category contributions, combined with a comprehensive benchmarking framework (MatText) spanning multiple representations and model scales, we find that LLMs consistently fail to capture coordinate information while excelling at category patterns. This geometric blindness persists regardless of model size (up to 70B parameters), dataset scale (up to 2M structures), or text representation strategy. Our findings suggest immediate practical implications: for materials property prediction tasks dominated by structural effects, specialized geometric architectures consistently outperform LLMs by significant margins, as evidenced by a clear "GNN-LM wall" in performance benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we provide concrete guidelines for architecture selection in scientific machine learning, while highlighting the critical importance of understanding model inductive biases when tackling scientific prediction problems.</description>

      <title>Work-function and structures of (100), (111) and (101) Au surfaces with/without oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Work function (f)is fundamental for chemistry and electronics. Additionally, f can be used to examine the validity of the theoretical surfaces by comparing it with experimental f, even in the absence of long-range orders. In the reported and present experiments, the difference in f between pristine and oxygen-covered Au surfaces (df) is &lt;1 eV at =&lt;1 ML (1 ML: one full-monolayer). Contrarily, the available density functional theory (DFT) reports df ~ 3 eV for Au(111) surfaces at 1 ML. Hence, we study structures of O-atom-covered Au(100), Au(110), and Au(111) surfaces using DFT. The calculated most stable structures show df &lt;1.1 eV at =&lt;1 ML and a nearly constant df at &gt; 1 ML, which match experiments and are confirmed using hybrid functional. These agreements result from the stability-criteria transition between low and high O-coverages, driven by the O-induced displacements of Au-atoms and the new surface structures at high O-coverages. The most stable structures exhibit molecule-like O arrangements at Au(111) surfaces at 1 ML and all surfaces at 2 ML; the former is considered chemisorption. At Au(111) surfaces, some structures containing O-atoms in subsurfaces have formation energies that approach those of the most stable structures, while the variation of these structures increases with surface size. Hence, mixing these structures with the most stable structures is believed to destroy long-range orders, which agrees with the experiments. The density of states at the surfaces calculated using the hybrid functional exhibit small bandgaps at the Au(100) and Au(110) surfaces at 1 ML.</description>

      <title>Atomic resolution imaging of the strength and 3D direction of atomic displacements in functional oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic resolution imaging is key to understanding thin film growth and how a particular set of conditions influences properties. Whilst such imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has had transformative impact in nanoscience, it forms projection images and provides no direct information about displacements perpendicular to the image plane. In this article we show that it is possible to make atomic resolution maps of the direction and magnitude of La displacements at ~30{\deg} to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6 thin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-La(Sr,Ta)O3) using a 4-dimensional STEM (4DSTEM) methodology. This reveals that the La modulation lies preferentially in the interface plane, and is strongly suppressed close to the epitaxial interface, and further reveals how the modulation varies with distance from the interface with unit cell resolution. These details would be completely invisible to all prior techniques in electron microscopy and this sheds light on why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double perovskite cation ordering, and the consequent optimal magnetic ordering for this thin film system. The approach used herein of fitting atomic resolution 4DSTEM data to determine crystal parameters opens the door for a new era of atomic-resolution crystallography.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption and luminescence of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03917v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction.
  The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$
  orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength.
  We relate this to a recent experimental study of
  cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.</description>

      <title>Efficient First-Principles Framework for Overdamped Phonon Dynamics and Anharmonic Electron-Phonon Coupling in Superionic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.</description>

      <title>Pressure Induced Altermagnetism in Layered Ternary Iron-Selenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing first-principles based calculations, we reexamined the high-pressure phases of the vacancy-ordered iron-selenides, i.e. A2Fe4Se5 phase. A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to Neel-AM phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of c-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the Neel-AM phase is a rare example of intrinsic altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. If the re-entrant superconducting phase of KyFe2-xSe2 under high pressure emerges from the Neel-AM normal state, an equal-spin triplet pairing would be naturally favored.</description>

Abstract: Some ternary TM nitrides are predicted to adopt layered structures that make them interesting for thermoelectric conversion and quantum materials applications. Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor deposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted 2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural interplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step combinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then process the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA. Synchrotron GIWAXS on films annealed at 1200 {\deg}C for 20 min reveals the nucleation of the layered structure (P63/mmc) within a composition window of x = Sc/(Sc+Ta) = 0.2-0.5. We estimate the long-range order parameter in stoichiometric ScTaN2 films to be 0.86, corresponding to a fraction of antisites of 7%. Interestingly, we find that the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich region (x &lt; 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural Ta5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on ScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021 cm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The carrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the residual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is dominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of weak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between ScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance of cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2 is promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Coordination-Driven Classification and Energetic Scaling of Boron Fullerenes and Borophene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets, unified under a coordination-based framework. By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = -a/n^b + E_c^{\mathrm{sheet}}$, with $b = 0.4$ or $b = 0.9$ depending on the coordination family, captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\chi^3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. Our analysis reveals two distinct families of boron nanostructures based on the scaling exponent: one with $b = 0.9$, comprising structures with significant 6-fold coordination, and another with $b = 0.4$, which includes B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, and two experimentally observed borophenes. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO--LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$~eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14~eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3\mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BaCd2P2 (BCP) has recently been identified as a promising solar absorber with excellent optoelectronic properties. Here we demonstrate the defect tolerance in BCP by comparing its optoelectronic quality with that of the well-studied absorber GaAs. Despite having a low precursor purity, our synthesized BCP samples exhibit a bright band-to-band room-temperature photoluminescence with low surface recombination losses, a high implied open-circuit voltage, and a carrier lifetime of ~300 ns, all better than those of GaAs samples obtained from a high-purity single-crystalline wafer. In contrast, GaAs samples synthesized using similar methods as BCP show no band-to-band photoluminescence emissions. To better probe the bulk properties and understand the high optoelectronic performance of BCP, we perform first-principles defect calculations and show that BCP has a much lower Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination rate compared to GaAs. Our results reveal BCP is robust to impurities introduced during synthesis and defect mediated nonradiative recombination, demonstrating its high photovoltaic potential.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) technology enables direct heat-to-electricity conversion and is gaining attention as a clean, fuel-saving, and carbon-neutral solution for industrial, automotive, and marine applications. Despite nearly a century of research, apart from successes in deep-space power sources and solid-state cooling modules, the industrialization and commercialization of TE power generation remain limited. Since the new millennium, nanostructured bulk materials have accelerated the discovery of new TE systems. However, due to limited access to high-temperature heat sources, energy harvesting still relies almost exclusively on BiTe-based alloys, which are the only system operating stably near room temperature. Although many BiTe-based compositions have been proposed, concerns over reproducibility, reliability, and lifetime continue to hinder industrial adoption. Here, we aim to develop reference BiTe-based thermoelectric materials through data-driven analysis of Starrydata2, the world's largest thermoelectric database. We identify Bi0.46Sb1.54Te3 and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 as the most frequently studied ternary compositions. These were synthesized using hot pressing and spark-plasma sintering. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated with respect to the processing method and measurement direction. The results align closely with the median of reported data, confirming the representativeness of the selected compositions. We propose these as reference BiTe materials, accompanied by transparent data and validated benchmarks. Their use can support the standardization of TE legs and modules while accelerating performance evaluation and industrial integration. We further estimated the performance of a thermoelectric module made from the reference composition, which gives the power output of over 2.51 W and an efficiency of 3.58% at a temperature difference of 120 K.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color-laser-driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we uniformly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the real-space path traced by the laser electric field. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zeroth order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and relative phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift- or injection-current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multicolor laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems</title>

Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.</description>

      <title>Switching of an antiferromagnet controlled by spin canting in a laser-induced hidden phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic characterization via deep indentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperelastic material characterization is crucial for understanding the behavior of soft materials -- such as tissues, rubbers, hydrogels, and polymers -- under quasi-static loading before failure. Traditional methods typically rely on uniaxial tensile tests, which require the cumbersome preparation of dumbbell-shaped samples for clamping in a uniaxial testing machine. In contrast, indentation-based methods, which can be conducted \textit{in-situ} without sample preparation, have been underexplored. To characterize the hyperelastic behavior of soft materials, deep indentation is required, where the material response extends beyond linear elasticity. In this study, we perform finite element analysis to link the force ($F$) versus indentation depth ($D$) curve with the hyperelastic behavior of a soft incompressible material, using a one-term Ogden model for simplicity. We identify three indentation regimes based on the ratio between indentation depth and the radius ($R$) of the spherical-tipped cylindrical indenter: the Hertzian regime ($D &lt; 0.1R$), where $F = \frac{16}{9} E R^{0.5} D^{1.5}$; the parabolic regime ($D &gt; 10R$), where $F = E D^2 \beta$ and the indenter radius becomes irrelevant; and an intermediate regime ($0.1R &lt; D &lt; 10R$) bridging the two extremes. We find that the Ogden strain-stiffening coefficient ($\alpha$) increases the parabolic indentation coefficient ($\beta$), allowing for the estimation of $\alpha$ from $\beta$. Furthermore, we observe that Coulomb friction increases $\beta$, potentially masking the effect of strain-stiffening for small $\alpha$. However, for $\alpha &gt; 3$, friction has a negligible effect. Finally, our results show good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that deep indentation can be an effective method for extracting hyperelastic properties from soft materials through \textit{in-situ} testing.</description>
