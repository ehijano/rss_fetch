      <title>Revisiting Vision-Language Features Adaptation and Inconsistency for Social Media Popularity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media popularity (SMP) prediction is a complex task involving multi-modal data integration. While pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been widely adopted for this task, their effectiveness in capturing the unique characteristics of social media content remains unexplored. This paper critically examines the applicability of CLIP-based features in SMP prediction, focusing on the overlooked phenomenon of semantic inconsistency between images and text in social media posts. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that this inconsistency increases with post popularity, challenging the conventional use of VLM features. We provide a comprehensive investigation of semantic inconsistency across different popularity intervals and analyze the impact of VLM feature adaptation on SMP tasks. Our experiments reveal that incorporating inconsistency measures and adapted text features significantly improves model performance, achieving an SRC of 0.729 and an MAE of 1.227. These findings not only enhance SMP prediction accuracy but also provide crucial insights for developing more targeted approaches in social media analysis.</description>

      <title>AIMDiT: Modality Augmentation and Interaction via Multimodal Dimension Transformation for Emotion Recognition in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is a popular task in natural language processing, which aims to recognize the emotional state of the speaker in conversations. While current research primarily emphasizes contextual modeling, there exists a dearth of investigation into effective multimodal fusion methods. We propose a novel framework called AIMDiT to solve the problem of multimodal fusion of deep features. Specifically, we design a Modality Augmentation Network which performs rich representation learning through dimension transformation of different modalities and parameter-efficient inception block. On the other hand, the Modality Interaction Network performs interaction fusion of extracted inter-modal features and intra-modal features. Experiments conducted using our AIMDiT framework on the public benchmark dataset MELD reveal 2.34% and 2.87% improvements in terms of the Acc-7 and w-F1 metrics compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</description>

      <title>SIDQL: An Efficient Keyframe Extraction and Motion Reconstruction Framework in Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaverse, which integrates the virtual and physical worlds, has emerged as an innovative paradigm for changing people's lifestyles. Motion capture has become a reliable approach to achieve seamless synchronization of the movements between avatars and human beings, which plays an important role in diverse Metaverse applications. However, due to the continuous growth of data, current communication systems face a significant challenge of meeting the demand of ultra-low latency during application. In addition, current methods also have shortcomings when selecting keyframes, e.g., relying on recognizing motion types and artificially selected keyframes. Therefore, the utilization of keyframe extraction and motion reconstruction techniques could be considered a feasible and promising solution. In this work, a new motion reconstruction algorithm is designed in a spherical coordinate system involving location and velocity information. Then, we formalize the keyframe extraction problem into an optimization problem to reduce the reconstruction error. Using Deep Q-Learning (DQL), the Spherical Interpolation based Deep Q-Learning (SIDQL) framework is proposed to generate proper keyframes for reconstructing the motion sequences. We use the CMU database to train and evaluate the framework. Our scheme can significantly reduce the data volume and transmission latency compared to various baselines while maintaining a reconstruction error of less than 0.09 when extracting five keyframes.</description>

      <title>AIM: Let Any Multi-modal Large Language Models Embrace Efficient In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) facilitates Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibiting emergent ability on downstream tasks without updating billions of parameters. However, in the area of multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), two problems hinder the application of multi-modal ICL: (1) Most primary MLLMs are only trained on single-image datasets, making them unable to read multi-modal demonstrations. (2) With the demonstrations increasing, thousands of visual tokens highly challenge hardware and degrade ICL performance. During preliminary explorations, we discovered that the inner LLM tends to focus more on the linguistic modality within multi-modal demonstrations to generate responses. Therefore, we propose a general and light-weighted framework \textbf{AIM} to tackle the mentioned problems through \textbf{A}ggregating \textbf{I}mage information of \textbf{M}ultimodal demonstrations to the dense latent space of the corresponding linguistic part. Specifically, AIM first uses the frozen backbone MLLM to read each image-text demonstration and extracts the vector representations on top of the text. These vectors naturally fuse the information of the image-text pair, and AIM transforms them into fused virtual tokens acceptable for the inner LLM via a trainable projection layer. Ultimately, these fused tokens function as variants of multi-modal demonstrations, fed into the MLLM to direct its response to the current query as usual. Because these fused tokens stem from the textual component of the image-text pair, a multi-modal demonstration is nearly reduced to a pure textual demonstration, thus seamlessly applying to any MLLMs. With its de facto MLLM frozen, AIM is parameter-efficient and we train it on public multi-modal web corpora which have nothing to do with downstream test tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Generating Diverse Audio Captions via Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a cross-modal translation task for describing the content of audio clips with natural language sentences. This task has attracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent years. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the content of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often deterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple (e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating the same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe the content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound events and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct words and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the ability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across similar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve diversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid discriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can be any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and the hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different criteria, such as their naturalness and semantics. We conduct experiments on the Clotho dataset. The results show that our proposed model can generate captions with better diversity as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>
