      <title>F-Purity of Binomial Edge Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, K. Matsuda introduced the class of weakly closed graphs and investigated when binomial edge ideals are F-pure. He proved that weakly closed binomial edge ideals are F-pure whenever the base field has positive characteristic. He conjectured that: (i) when the base field has characteristic two, every F-pure binomial edge ideal comes from a weakly closed graph; and (ii) that every binomial edge ideal is F-pure provided that the characteristic of the residue field is sufficiently large.
  In this paper, we resolve both of Matsuda's conjectures. We confirm Matsuda's first conjecture, showing that the binomial edge ideal of a graph defines an F-pure quotient in characteristic 2 if and only if the graph is weakly closed. We also show that Matsuda's second conjecture is false in a very strong way by showing that graphs containing asteroidal triples, such as the net, define non-F-pure binomial edge ideals in any positive characteristic. Our results yield a complete classification of F-pure binomial edge ideals of chordal graphs as well as large families of standard graded algebras that are F-injective but neither F-pure nor F-rational in all characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Let K be a field of characteristic 0. Let P_K(5,103,169) be the defining ideal of the space monomial curve {(t^5,t^{103},t^{169})}. In this paper we shall prove that the symbolic Rees algebra R_s(P_K(5,103,169)) is not Noetherian, that is, is not finitely generated over K.</description>

      <title>On maximal rank properties for symmetric polynomials in an equigenerated monomial complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a monomial complete intersection has the strong Lefschetz property in characteristic zero. This property is equivalent to the statement that any power of the sum of the variables is a maximal rank element on the complete intersection. In this paper, we investigate what happens when this element is replaced by another symmetric polynomial, in an equigenerated complete intersection.
  We answer the question completely for the power sum symmetric polynomial using a grading technique, and for any Schur polynomial in the case of two variables by deriving a closed formula for the determinants of a family of Toeplitz matrices. Further, we obtain partial results in three or more variables for the elementary and the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>Gorenstein flat preenvelopes and weakly Ding injective covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a (left) coherent ring R. We prove that if the character module of every Ding injective (left) R-module is Gorenstein flat, then the class of Gorenstein flat (right) R-modules, GF, is preenveloping. We show that this is the case when every injective (left) R-module has finite flat dimension. In particular, GF is preenveloping over any Ding-Chen ring.\\ The proofs use the class of weakly Ding injective (left) R-modules, wDI. We show that, when wDI is closed under extensions, the following statements are equivalent:\\ 1. The character module of every Ding injective left R-module is a Gorenstein flat right R-module.\\ 2. The class of weakly Ding injective left R-modules is closed under direct limits.\\ 3. The class of weakly Ding injective modules is covering.\\ The equivalent statements (1)-(3) imply that GF is preenveloping</description>

      <title>Geometrically vertex decomposable open neighborhood ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the open neighborhood ideal of a TD-unmixed tree is geometrically vertex decomposable. This result implies that the associated Stanley-Reisner complex is vertex decomposable. We further demonstrate that Cohen-Macaulay open neighborhood ideals of trees are special cases of Cohen-Macaulay facet ideals of simplicial trees. Finally, we investigate open neighborhood ideals of chordal graphs and establish that almost all square-free monomial ideal can be realized as the open neighborhood ideal of a chordal graph.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert scheme of points on a threefold: broken Gorenstein structures and linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth threefold. We introduce a notion of broken Gorenstein structure for finite schemes, and show that its existence guarantees smoothness on the Hilbert scheme. Moreover, we conjecture that it is exhaustive: every smooth point admits a broken Gorenstein structure. We give an explicit characterization of the smooth points on the Hilbert scheme of A^3 corresponding to monomial ideals. We investigate the nature of the singular points, and prove several conjectures by Hu. Along the way, we obtain a number of additional results, related to linkage classes, nested Hilbert schemes, and a bundle on the Hilbert scheme of a surface.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe some invariant Laurent polynomial rings, and resolve the questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita.</description>
