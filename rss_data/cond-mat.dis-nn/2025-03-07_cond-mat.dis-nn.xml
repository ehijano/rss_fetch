      <title>Relationship between the shear moduli and defect-induced structural relaxation ofhigh-entropy metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed high-frequency shear modulus and calorimetry measurements on seven high-entropy metallic glasses (HEMGs) in the initial, relaxed and crystalline states. It is shown that the shear modulus of HEMGs is intrinsically related with the concentration of defects responsible for structural relaxation. In the absence of structural relaxation, temperature coefficient of shear modulus of glass equals to that of the maternal crystal. All found regularities are governed by a single equation.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the glass transition in metallic glasses after deep relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed parallel study of calorimetric and high-frequency shear modulus behavior of Zr-based metallic glasses after deep relaxation just below the glass transition. It is shown that deep relaxation results in the appearance of a strong peak of the excess heat capacity while the shear modulus is moderately affected. A theory assuming high-frequency shear modulus to be a major physical parameter controlling glass relaxation is suggested. The energy barrier for these rearrangements is proportional to the shear modulus while its magnitude, in turn, varies due to the changes in the defect concentration (diaelastic effect). Both dependences lead to the occurrence of heat effects. The excess heat capacity calculated using experimental shear modulus data demonstrates very good agreement with the experimental calorimetric data for all states of glasses. It is argued that the glass transition behavior after deep relaxation of glass is close to a phase transition of the first kind.</description>

      <title>Beyond Disorder: Unveiling Cooperativeness in Multidirectional Associative Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging tools from the statistical mechanics of complex systems, in these short notes we extend the architecture of a neural network for hetero-associative memory (called three-directional associative memories, TAM) to explore supervised and unsupervised learning protocols. In particular, by providing entropic-heterogeneous datasets to its various layers, we predict and quantify a new emergent phenomenon -- that we term {\em layer's cooperativeness} -- where the interplay of dataset entropies across network's layers enhances their retrieval capabilities Beyond those they would have without reciprocal influence. Naively we would expect layers trained with less informative datasets to develop smaller retrieval regions compared to those pertaining to layers that experienced more information: this does not happen and all the retrieval regions settle to the same amplitude, allowing for optimal retrieval performance globally. This cooperative dynamics marks a significant advancement in understanding emergent computational capabilities within disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of distinct mobility edges in a 1D quasiperiodic mosaic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional quasiperiodic mosaic model with analytically solvable mobility edges that exhibit different phase transitions depending on the system parameters. Specifically, by combining mosaic quasiperiodic next-nearest-neighbor hoppings and quasiperiodic on-site potentials, we rigorously demonstrate the existence of two distinct types of mobility edges: those separating extended and critical states, and those separating extended and localized states. Using Avila's global theory, we derive exact analytical expressions for these mobility edges and determine the parameter regimes where each type dominates. Our numerical calculations confirm these analytical results through fractal dimension analysis. Furthermore, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to realize this model using Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with engineered momentum-state transitions. We also investigate the effects of many-body interactions under mean-field approximation. Our work provides a fertile ground for studying the coexistence of different types of mobility edges in quasiperiodic systems and suggests a feasible experimental platform to observe and control these transitions.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical quantum embedding by machine learning for large molecular assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-in-quantum embedding strategy coupled to machine learning potentials to improve on the accuracy of quantum-classical hybrid models for the description of large molecules. In such hybrid models, relevant structural regions (such as those around reaction centers or pockets for binding of host molecules) can be described by a quantum model that is then embedded into a classical molecular-mechanics environment. However, this quantum region may become so large that only approximate electronic structure models are applicable. To then restore accuracy in the quantum description, we here introduce the concept of quantum cores within the quantum region that are amenable to accurate electronic structure models due to their limited size. Huzinaga-type projection-based embedding, for example, can deliver accurate electronic energies obtained with advanced electronic structure methods. The resulting total electronic energies are then fed into a transfer learning approach that efficiently exploits the higher-accuracy data to improve on a machine learning potential obtained for the original quantum-classical hybrid approach. We explore the potential of this approach in the context of a well-studied protein-ligand complex for which we calculate the free energy of binding using alchemical free energy and non-equilibrium switching simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Calculation of Quantum-Classical Binding Free Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accurate description. We propose a general and automated workflow that samples the potential energy surface with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations and trains a machine learning (ML) potential on the QM energies and forces to enable efficient alchemical free energy simulations. To represent systems including many different chemical elements efficiently and to account for the different description of QM and MM atoms, we propose an extension of element-embracing atom-centered symmetry functions for QM/MM data as an ML descriptor. The ML potential approach takes electrostatic embedding and long-range electrostatics into account. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow on the well-studied protein--ligand complex of myeloid cell leukemia 1 and the inhibitor 19G and on the anti-cancer drug NKP1339 acting on the glucose-regulated protein 78.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and entanglement dynamics in Floquet Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and entanglement of entropy as quantitative measures of information propagation in disordered many-body systems exhibiting Floquet time-crystal (FTC) phases. We find that OTOC spreads in the FTC with different characteristic timescales due to the existence of a preferred ``quasi-protected'' direction - denoted as $\ell$-bit direction - along which the spins stabilize their period-doubling magnetization for exponentially long times. While orthogonal to this direction the OTOC thermalizes as an usual MBL time-independent system (at stroboscopic times), along the $\ell$-bit direction the system features a more complex structure. The scrambling appears as a combination of an initially frozen dynamics (while in the stable period doubling magnetization time window) and a later logarithmic slow growth (over its decoherence regime) till full thermalization. Interestingly, in the late time regime, since the wavefront propagation of correlations has already settled through the whole chain, scrambling occurs at the same rate regardless of the distance between the spins, thus resulting in an overall envelope-like structure of all OTOCs, independent of their distance, merging into a single growth. Alongside, the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic growth over all time, reflecting the slow dynamics up to a thermal volume-law saturation.</description>

      <title>When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at https://github.com/dayal-kalra/low-memory-adam.</description>
