      <title>Open-Source Differentiable Lithography Imaging Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the electronics industry, driven by Moore's law and the proliferation of integrated circuits, has led to significant advancements in modern society, including the Internet, wireless communication, and artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this progress is optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing that accounts for approximately 30\% to 40\% of production costs. As semiconductor nodes shrink and transistor numbers increase, optical lithography becomes increasingly vital in current integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technology. This paper introduces an open-source differentiable lithography imaging framework that leverages the principles of differentiable programming and the computational power of GPUs to enhance the precision of lithography modeling and simplify the optimization of resolution enhancement techniques (RETs). The framework models the core components of lithography as differentiable segments, allowing for the implementation of standard scalar imaging models, including the Abbe and Hopkins models, as well as their approximation models. The paper introduces a computational lithography framework that optimizes semiconductor manufacturing processes using advanced computational techniques and differentiable programming. It compares imaging models and provides tools for enhancing resolution, demonstrating improved semiconductor patterning performance. The open-sourced framework represents a significant advancement in lithography technology, facilitating collaboration in the field.

      <title>Lithium Niobate Resonators for Power Conversion: Spurious Mode Suppression Via an Active Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to shift the paradigm of power conversion, acoustic resonators pose as compact alternatives for lossy magnetic inductors. Currently, the acoustic resonator's restricted inductive region between its series and parallel resonances constitutes a major bottleneck, which is further diminished due to spurious modes. Prior work has partially addressed this issue by the introduction of various design guidelines tailored to the material and the mode of interest, but can only provide a limited spurious-free region. Alternatively, a separated grounded ring on LN operating in the first order symmetric lamb mode (S1), maintains optimal device performance with a large fractional spurious mode suppressed region, but has been shown to experience voltage breakdown at high power near the ring at different potentials. Hence, we propose a new spurious mode suppressing design leveraging a thickened active ring in lithium niobate (LN), maintaining high Q and k2 while also reducing resistance at resonance (Rr), and mitigating breakdown effects.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning real-time phase retrieval of imperfect diffraction patterns from X-ray free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is attracting surging interest across nearly all scientific areas by enabling the analysis of large datasets and the extraction of scientific information from incomplete data. Data-driven science is rapidly growing, especially in X-ray methodologies, where advanced light sources and detection technologies accumulate vast amounts of data that exceed meticulous human inspection capabilities. Despite the increasing demands, the full application of machine learning has been hindered by the need for data-specific optimizations. In this study, we introduce a new deep-learning-based phase retrieval method for imperfect diffraction data. This method provides robust phase retrieval for simulated data and performs well on weak-signal single-pulse diffraction data from X-ray free-electron lasers. Moreover, the method significantly reduces data processing time, facilitating real-time image reconstructions that are crucial for high-repetition-rate data acquisition. Thus, this approach offers a reliable solution to the phase problem and is expected to be widely adopted across various research areas.</description>

      <title>Single-crystalline GaAs/Si Heterojunction Tunnel Diodes Interfaced by an Ultrathin Oxygen-enriched Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characteristics of GaAs/Si p+/n+ heterojunction tunnel diodes. These diodes were fabricated via grafting the freestanding single-crystalline p-type degenerately doped GaAs (4E19 cm-3) nanomembrane (NM) onto single-crystalline n-type Si (5E19 cm-3) substrate. At the heterointerface, an amorphous ultrathin oxygen-enriched layer (UOL) was intentionally engineered through chemical oxidation and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the formation of the UOL and the single crystallinity of the grafted junction. The resulting tunnel diodes consistently exhibited negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior at room temperature, with a high maximum peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) of 36.38, valley voltages ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 V, and a peak tunneling current density of 0.95 kA/cm2. This study not only highlights the critical roles of the UOL as both an interface improvement layer and a quantum tunneling medium, but also establishes "semiconductor grafting" as an effective and versatile method for high-performance, lattice-mismatched heterojunction devices.</description>

      <title>Correlation between Electrochemical Relaxations and Morphologies of Conducting Polymer Dendrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conducting Polymer Dendrites (CPD) can engrave sophisticated patterns of electrical interconnects in their morphology with low-voltage spikes and few resources: they may unlock in operando manufacturing functionalities for electronics using metamorphism conjointly with electron transport as part of the information processing. The relationship between structure and information transport remains unclear and hinders the exploitation of the versatility of their morphologies to store and process electrodynamic information. This study details the evolution of CPD's circuit parameters with their growth and shape. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, multiple distributions of relaxation times are evidenced and evolve specifically upon growth. Correlations are established between dispersive capacitances of dendritic morphologies and growth duration, independently from exogenous physical variables: distance, evaporation or aging. Deviation of the anomalous capacitance from the conventional Debye dielectric relaxation can be programmed, as the growth controls the dispersion coefficient of the dendrite's constant-phase elements relaxation. These results suggest that the fading-memory time window of pseudo-capacitive interconnects can practically be conditioned using CPD morphogenesis as an in materio learning mechanism. This study confirms the perspective of using electrochemistry for unconventional electronics, engraving information in the physics of conducting polymer objects, and storing information in their morphology, accessible by impedance spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Electric field management in $\beta$-$Ga_2O_3$ vertical Schottky diodes using high-k bismuth zinc niobium oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have integrated bismuth zinc niobium oxide (BZN), a high-k dielectric material, in metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) and field-plated metal-semiconductor (FP-MS) Schottky barrier diodes on $\beta$-$Ga_2O_3$. This increases the breakdown voltage ($V_{BR}$) from 300 V to 600 V by redistributing the electric fields, leveraging the high permittivity of BZN (k ~210). Enhancement in Schottky barrier height, by approximately 0.14 eV for MIS and 0.28 eV for FP-MS devices, also contributes to the improved $V_{BR}$. BZN inclusion has minimal impact on specific on-resistance ($R_{on,sp}$). Additionally, the devices display excellent current-voltage characteristics with ideality factors close to unity and an on/off current ratio greater than 1010. This work presents the most significant $V_{BR}$ enhancement reported-to-date for MIS devices on $\beta$-$Ga_2O_3$ without compromising turn-on voltage and $R_{on,sp}$. A comparison of FP-MS and MIS devices shows that FP-MS outperforms MIS in terms of lower $R_{on,sp}$, higher Schottky barrier height, and improved VBR.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Stress Waves in Layered Media: I. Non-Hermitian Degeneracies and Modal Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the band structure and scattering of in-plane coupled longitudinal and shear stress waves in layered media and observe that exceptional points (EP) appear for elastic (lossless) media, when parameterized with real-valued frequency and tangential wave vector component. The occurrence of these EP pairs is not limited to the original stop bands. They could also appear in all mode pass bands, leading to the formation of new stop bands. The scattered energy near these locations is studied along with the associated polarization patterns. The broken phase symmetry is observed inside the frequency bands book-ended by these EP pairs. This is especially manifested by the chirality of the trajectory of the particle velocity, which gets selected by a ``direction'' of the wave, e.g. the imaginary part of normal component of the wave vector, or the energy flux direction just outside the band. Additionally, EP pairs also appear in the spectrum of the (modified) scattering matrix when mechanical gain is theoretically included to balance the loss in a parity-time symmetric finite structure. These EP pairs lead to amplification of transmission to above 1 and single-sided reflectivity, both phenomena associated with broken phase symmetry, with intriguing potential applications.</description>

      <title>Programmable Motion of Optically Gated Electrically Powered Engineered Microswimmer Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we report on a new class active particles capable of dynamically programmable motion powered by electricity. We have implemented physical principles that separate the propulsion and steering mechanisms of active motion using optically activated, patterned, photoresponsive semiconductor coatings on intricate microstructures. Our engineered microswimmer robots employ an induced-charge electro-phoresis (ICEP) mechanism to achieve linear motion and optically modulated electrokinetic propulsion (OMEP) for steering. Optical modulation is achieved by manipulating the polarizability of patterned ZnO semiconductor coating through exposure to light with wavelengths above its bandgap, exploiting the semiconductor's photoconductive properties. Unlike previous methods that rely on changing the direction of optical illumination or spatially controlling narrow optical beams, our approach achieves optical steering under uniform ambient illumination conditions, thereby greatly reducing the complexity of the optical system. The decoupling of propulsion and steering allows for the programming of micromotor trajectories in both open and closed-loop control modes. We anticipate that our findings will pave the way for efficient optically gated control of the trajectory of photoresponsive active particles. Furthermore, they will enable the selective manipulation of specific subgroups of engineered active microparticles with various semiconducting coatings having different band gaps.</description>

      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assembly of molecules with covalent networks can form varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Metal Oxide Nanocrystals as Building Blocks for Infrared Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on experimental and simulation methods we helped develop, we are advancing mechanistic understanding of how self-assembled NC metamaterials can produce distinctive near- and far-field optical properties not readily achievable in lithographically patterned structures. First, the impacts of the inevitable defects and disorder associated with self-assembly can be rationalized and, in some cases, recognized as advantageous. Second, self-assembly enables intimate nanoscale intermixing of different NC and molecular components. By incorporating probe molecules within the gaps between NCs where the electric field enhancement is strongest, we show enhanced detection of molecular vibrations that can be optimized by tuning the size and resonance frequency of the NCs. We show how metasurfaces incorporating mixtures of NCs with different doping concentrations can achieve epsilon-near-zero dielectric response over a broad frequency range. Finally, considering the NC metasurface itself as a building block, we show how photonic structures incorporating these assemblies can harness and amplify their distinctive properties. Through modeling the NC monolayer as a slab with an effective permittivity response, we designed a frequency-tunable IR perfect absorber by layering the NCs on a simple open cavity structure. Since the perfect absorption architecture further enhances the IR electric field localization strength, we expect that this integration strategy can enhance molecular vibration coupling or non-linear optical response. The versatility of the NC assembly and integration approach suggests opportunities for various metal oxide NC superstructures, including mixing and stacking of NCs beyond a single monolayer, representing a vast parameter space for design of linear and nonlinear IR optical components.</description>

      <title>Microwave photonic frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis: Unlocking bandwidths over hundreds of GHz with a 10-nanosecond temporal resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and broadband spectrum sensing is an essential component in cognitive radio systems, intelligent transportation systems, electronic warfare systems, etc. However, traditional electronic-based solutions have a trade-off among the analysis bandwidth, temporal resolution, and real-time performance. In comparison, microwave photonic solutions can overcome the trade-off at the cost of frequency accuracy and resolution. Nevertheless, the reported microwave photonic solutions suffer from a very poor frequency resolution and impose extremely high requirements on hardware when the analysis bandwidth is close to or greater than 100 GHz. Here, we show a microwave photonic frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis method, which is implemented by dispersion-based frequency-to-time mapping and assisted by a specially designed V-shape linearly frequency-modulated signal and a duty-cycle-enabling technique. Compared with the reported microwave photonic solutions, the hardware requirements are greatly reduced when achieving similar performance conditions. Using a total dispersion of -6817 ps/nm and a V-shape linearly frequency-modulated signal with a bandwidth of 31.6 GHz and a duty cycle of 1/4, we achieve an ambiguity-free analysis bandwidth of 252.8 GHz, a corresponding temporal resolution of 13.75 ns and a frequency resolution of 1.1 GHz. The temporal resolution can be improved to 6.875 ns when the duty cycle is changed to 1/2, while the analysis bandwidth in this case is 126.4 GHz.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Multimode Fiber Imaging and Characterization Under Thermal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15797v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF) imaging aided by machine learning holds promise for numerous applications, including medical endoscopy. A key challenge for this technology is the sensitivity of modal transmission characteristics to environmental perturbations. Here, we show experimentally that an MMF imaging scheme based on a neural network (NN) can achieve results that are significantly robust to thermal perturbations. For example, natural images are successfully reconstructed as the MMF's temperature is varied by up to 50$^{\circ}$C relative to the training scenario, despite substantial variations in the speckle patterns caused by thermal changes. A dense NN with a single hidden layer is found to outperform a convolutional NN suitable for standard computer vision tasks. In addition, we demonstrate that NN parameters can be used to understand the MMF properties by reconstructing the approximate transmission matrices, and we show that the image reconstruction accuracy is directly related to the temperature dependence of the MMF's transmission characteristics.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously enhancing brightness and purity of WSe$_2$ single photon emitter using high-aspect-ratio nanopillar array on metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer semiconductor transferred on nanopillar arrays provides site-controlled, on-chip single photon emission, which is a scalable light source platform for quantum technologies. However, the brightness of these emitters reported to date often falls short of the perceived requirement for such applications. Also, the single photon purity usually degrades as the brightness increases. Hence, there is a need for a design methodology to achieve enhanced emission rate while maintaining high single photon purity. Using WSe$_2$ on high-aspect-ratio ($\sim 3$ - at least two-fold higher than previous reports) nanopillar arrays, here we demonstrate $&gt;10$ MHz single photon emission rate in the 770-800 nm band that is compatible with quantum memory and repeater networks (Rb-87-D1/D2 lines), and satellite quantum communication. The emitters exhibit excellent purity (even at high emission rates) and improved out-coupling due to the use of a gold back reflector that quenches the emission away from the nanopillar.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond all-optically reconfigurable photonics in optical fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel all-optical platform in multimode and multicore fibres. By using a low-power probe beam and a high-power counter-propagating control beam, we achieve advanced and dynamic control over light propagation within the fibres. This setup enables all-optical reconfiguration of the probe, which is achieved by solely tuning the control beam power. Key operations such as fully tuneable power splitting and mode conversion, core-to-core switching and combination, along with remote probe characterization, are demonstrated at the sub-nanosecond time scale. Our experimental results are supported by a theoretical model that extends to fibres with an arbitrary number of modes and cores. The implementation of these operations in a single platform underlines its versatility, a critical feature of next-generation photonic systems. These results represent a significant shift from existing methods that rely on electro-optical or thermo-optical modulation for tunability. They pave the way towards a fast and energy-efficient alternative through all-optical modulation, a keystone for the advancement of future reconfigurable optical networks and optical computing. Scaling these techniques to highly nonlinear materials could underpin ultrafast all-optically programmable integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Modeling luminescent coupling in multi-junction solar cells: Perovskite Silicon tandem case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminescent coupling is a characteristic of multi-junction solar cells which has often been neglected in models of their performance. The effect describes the absorption of light emitted from a higher band gap semiconductor by a lower band gap semiconductor. In this way, light which might have been lost can be utilized for current generation. We present a framework for modeling this effect in both planar layer stacks and devices with periodic nanostructuring. As a case study, we evaluate how luminescent coupling is affected by the inclusion of nanostructuring in a perovskite silicon tandem solar cell. We find that nanostructuring, while reducing the reflection loss for tandem solar cells also reduces the luminescent coupling, allowing more light to be emitted to the surroundings, when compared to planar devices. This highlights the need to include modeling of this effect into optimization schemes in order to find the trade-off between these two effects.

      <title>Machine learning approaches for automatic defect detection in photovoltaic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar photovoltaic (PV) modules are prone to damage during manufacturing, installation and operation which reduces their power conversion efficiency. This diminishes their positive environmental impact over the lifecycle. Continuous monitoring of PV modules during operation via unmanned aerial vehicles is essential to ensure that defective panels are promptly replaced or repaired to maintain high power conversion efficiencies. Computer vision provides an automatic, non-destructive and cost-effective tool for monitoring defects in large-scale PV plants. We review the current landscape of deep learning-based computer vision techniques used for detecting defects in solar modules. We compare and evaluate the existing approaches at different levels, namely the type of images used, data collection and processing method, deep learning architectures employed, and model interpretability. Most approaches use convolutional neural networks together with data augmentation or generative adversarial network-based techniques. We evaluate the deep learning approaches by performing interpretability analysis on classification tasks. This analysis reveals that the model focuses on the darker regions of the image to perform the classification. We find clear gaps in the existing approaches while also laying out the groundwork for mitigating these challenges when building new models. We conclude with the relevant research gaps that need to be addressed and approaches for progress in this field: integrating geometric deep learning with existing approaches for building more robust and reliable models, leveraging physics-based neural networks that combine domain expertise of physical laws to build more domain-aware deep learning models, and incorporating interpretability as a factor for building models that can be trusted. The review points towards a clear roadmap for making this technology commercially relevant.</description>

      <title>The Arrhenius Law Prefactor in Permalloy Mesoscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arrhenius equation was used to describe the dynamics of two-state switching in mesoscale, ferromagnetic particles. Using square, permalloy dots as an idealized two-state switching system, measurements of the prefactor of the Arrhenius law changed by 26 decades over barrier heights from 30 meV to 700 meV. Measurements of the prefactor ratios for a two well system revealed significant deviations from the common interpretation of the Arrhenius law. The anomalous Arrhenius prefactors and the prefactor ratios can be fitted to a modified model that includes entropic contributions to two-state transitions. Similar considerations are likely for the application of the Arrhenius law to other mesoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Magnetic Switching of THz Signal in Planar Structured Spintronic Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>
