      <title>Multifaceted Evaluation of Audio-Visual Capability for MLLMs: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Generalizability and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved great success in processing and understanding information from diverse modalities (e.g., text, audio, and visual signals). Despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation measuring the audio-visual capabilities of these models, especially in diverse scenarios (e.g., distribution shifts and adversarial attacks). In this paper, we present a multifaceted evaluation of the audio-visual capability of MLLMs, focusing on four key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we find that MLLMs exhibit strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities, enabling them to achieve great performance with limited data. However, their success relies heavily on the vision modality, which impairs performance when visual input is corrupted or missing. Additionally, while MLLMs are susceptible to adversarial samples, they demonstrate greater robustness compared to traditional models. The experimental results and our findings provide insights into the audio-visual capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement and offering guidance for future research.</description>

      <title>Social sustainability through engagement in a training context with tools such as the Native Podcast and Facebook social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social dimension of sustainability seems to have been a notion rarely addressed in the literature (Dubois et al., 2001) until the early 2000s. The EUTIC 2023 symposium provides an opportunity to take up this topical issue. To this end, we are presenting an engagement process that is part of a sustainable development dynamic, based on digital tools inspired by everyday life, for applications in the context of training, with a view to lifelong learning. Our work, which stems from the information and communication sciences, is rooted in a multi-disciplinary approach that we believe can be echoed in a variety of disciplines, but which it is interesting to challenge, hence the purpose of this contribution.</description>

      <title>Seeing The Words: Evaluating AI-generated Biblical Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past years witnessed a significant amount of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that can generate images from texts. This triggers the discussion of whether AI can generate accurate images using text from the Bible with respect to the corresponding biblical contexts and backgrounds. Despite some existing attempts at a small scale, little work has been done to systematically evaluate these generated images. In this work, we provide a large dataset of over 7K images using biblical text as prompts. These images were evaluated with multiple neural network-based tools on various aspects. We provide an assessment of accuracy and some analysis from the perspective of religion and aesthetics. Finally, we discuss the use of the generated images and reflect on the performance of the AI generators.</description>

      <title>DIVE: Inverting Conditional Diffusion Models for Discriminative Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in various generative tasks such as image and video generation. This paper studies the problem of leveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks. Specifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen generative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex object detection task, by "inverting" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion model. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for replacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution model for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed respectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic discriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our method can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for classification without sacrificing accuracy.

      <title>MV-Crafter: An Intelligent System for Music-guided Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music videos, as a prevalent form of multimedia entertainment, deliver engaging audio-visual experiences to audiences and have gained immense popularity among singers and fans. Creators can express their interpretations of music naturally through visual elements. However, the creation process of music video demands proficiency in script design, video shooting, and music-video synchronization, posing significant challenges for non-professionals. Previous work has designed automated music video generation frameworks. However, they suffer from complexity in input and poor output quality. In response, we present MV-Crafter, a system capable of producing high-quality music videos with synchronized music-video rhythm and style. Our approach involves three technical modules that simulate the human creation process: the script generation module, video generation module, and music-video synchronization module. MV-Crafter leverages a large language model to generate scripts considering the musical semantics. To address the challenge of synchronizing short video clips with music of varying lengths, we propose a dynamic beat matching algorithm and visual envelope-induced warping method to ensure precise, monotonic music-video synchronization. Besides, we design a user-friendly interface to simplify the creation process with intuitive editing features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MV-Crafter provides an effective solution for improving the quality of generated music videos.</description>

      <title>M-MRE: Extending the Mutual Reinforcement Effect to Multimodal Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the textual domain.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Knowledge-Based Vision Question Answering Systems: The Lifecycle of Knowledge in Visual Reasoning Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) extends general Vision Question Answering (VQA) by not only requiring the understanding of visual and textual inputs but also extensive range of knowledge, enabling significant advancements across various real-world applications. KB-VQA introduces unique challenges, including the alignment of heterogeneous information from diverse modalities and sources, the retrieval of relevant knowledge from noisy or large-scale repositories, and the execution of complex reasoning to infer answers from the combined context. With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), KB-VQA systems have also undergone a notable transformation, where LLMs serve as powerful knowledge repositories, retrieval-augmented generators and strong reasoners. Despite substantial progress, no comprehensive survey currently exists that systematically organizes and reviews the existing KB-VQA methods. This survey aims to fill this gap by establishing a structured taxonomy of KB-VQA approaches, and categorizing the systems into main stages: knowledge representation, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge reasoning. By exploring various knowledge integration techniques and identifying persistent challenges, this work also outlines promising future research directions, providing a foundation for advancing KB-VQA models and their applications.</description>

      <title>CasualHDRSplat: Robust High Dynamic Range 3D Gaussian Splatting from Casually Captured Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have garnered widespread attention due to their superior performance. However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality.

      <title>FMNV: A Dataset of Media-Published News Videos for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: News media, particularly video-based platforms, have become deeply embedded in daily life, concurrently amplifying risks of misinformation dissemination. Consequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant research attention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated videos characterized by crude editing and limited public engagement, whereas professionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets, often politically or virally motivated-pose substantially greater societal harm. To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel dataset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture integrating CLIP and Faster R-CNN for video feature extraction, enhanced by co-attention mechanisms for feature refinement and multimodal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generalization capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detection efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes critical benchmarks for detecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems while advancing methodologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Help Multimodal Language Analysis? MMLA: A Comprehensive Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances. Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field. The datasets and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA.</description>
