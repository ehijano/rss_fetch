      <title>Products of Finitely-Generated Groups with a Certain Growth Condition Have Fixed Price One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open problem posed by Gaboriau is whether the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. We provide an affirmative answer if the two groups are finitely generated and their growths satisfy a specific condition. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak factor of i.i.d., where each horoball is equipped with a marking that depends only on the first coordinate, in an i.i.d. manner. Then, a low-cost graphing of this process is constructed using the markings of the horoballs and adding a percolation with small intensity.</description>

      <title>Fundamental techniques in the study of parabolic subgroups of Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey was written on the occasion of the course I gave at the Winterbraids XIV workshop in Bordeaux (2025). Its main purpose is to present the techniques that have proven most effective in the study of parabolic subgroups of Artin groups, with particular emphasis on the parabolic subgroups intersection problem. The survey highlights the core ideas and strategies behind them, aiming to give the reader a concise and accessible entry point to the essential methods.</description>

      <title>Normal subgroups of non-torsion multi-EGS groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of normal subgroups in non-torsion, regular branch multi-EGS groups and show that the congruence completions of such groups have bounded finite central width. In particular, we show that the profinite completion of the Fabrykowski--Gupta group acting on the $p$-adic tree has central width 2 for every odd prime $p$. The methods used also apply to the family of Sunic groups, which closely resemble the Grigorchuk group.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on decay in countable groups and amalgamated free products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we first study the notion of subexponential decay (SD) for countable groups with respect to a length function, which generalizes the well-known rapid decay (RD) property, first discovered by Haagerup in 1979. Several natural properties and examples are studied, especially including groups that have SD, but not RD. This consideration naturally has applications in $C^*$-algebras. We also consider in this setting a permanence theorem for decay in amalgamated free products (proved also recently by Chatterji--Gautero), and demonstrate that it is in a precise sense optimal.</description>

      <title>Maximal Subsemigroups of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$ on a set $X$ consists of all bijective functions whose domain and range are subsets of $X$ under the usual composition and inversion of partial functions. For an arbitrary infinite set $X$, we classify all maximal subsemigroups and maximal inverse subsemigroups of $I_X$ which contain the symmetric group Sym($X$) or any of the following subgroups of Sym($X$): the pointwise stabiliser of a finite subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, or the stabiliser of a partition of $X$ into finitely many parts of equal cardinality.</description>

      <title>On the Maximal Subgroups of $E_7(q)$ and Related Almost Simple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper almost classifies the maximal subgroups of $E_7(q)$ for general $q$ a power of a prime $p$. Only four potential maximal subgroups are missing: $PSL_2(7)$ (unknown for $p\neq 2,3,7$), $PSL_2(8)$ ($p=2$) and $PSL_2(9)=A_6$ ($p\neq 2,3$). In addition, there is one issue with the precise structure with the positive-dimensional maximal subgroup of type $A_2$. We are able to give a complete determination of the maximal subgroups for $E_7(q)$ for $q$ an arbitrary power of $3$ and $q=4$.</description>

      <title>The lower $p$-series of analytic pro-$p$ groups and Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $p$-adic analytic pro-$p$ group of dimension $d$. We produce an approximate series which descends regularly in strata and whose terms deviate from the lower $p$-series in a uniformly bounded way. This brings to light a new set of rational invariants, canonically associated to $G$, that yield the aforementioned uniform bound and that restrict the possible values for the Hausdorff dimensions of closed subgroups of $G$ with respect to the lower $p$-series. In particular, the Hausdorff spectrum of $G$ with respect to the lower $p$-series is discrete and consists of at most $2^d$ rational numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of infinite, linearly ordered products in general groups. Using this, we define infinite compositions in certain groups of formal power series such as transseries. We show that such groups can sometimes be represented as infinite, linearly ordered, semidirect products of ordered Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>On the proofs of Leighton's Graph Covering Theorem, a notion dual to commensurability, and normal virtual retracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leighton's Graph Covering Theorem states that if two finite graphs have the same universal covering tree, then they also have a common finite degree cover. Bass and Kulkarni gave an alternative proof of this fact using tree lattices. We give an example of two graphs that admit a common finite cover which can not be obtained using tree lattice techniques. If two groups embed as finite index subgroups, we say they are co-commensurable. Our example comes from an explicit commensuration that cannot be induced by a co-commensuration. Next we state and prove a general theorem that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for when a commensuration can be induced by a co-commensuration. The developed machinery is then used to show that normal virtual retracts are virtual direct summands, answering a question of Merladet and Minasyan. In an appendix, applications to commensurating graphs of groups, biautomaticity, and hereditary conjugacy separability are given.</description>

      <title>A computational study of certain Weyl modules for type $G_2$ in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the \texttt{WeylModules} \textsf{GAP} Package, we compute
  structural information about certain Weyl modules for type $G_2$ in
  characteristic $2$. This gives counterexamples to two conjectures
  stated by S.~Donkin in 1990. It also illustrates capabilities of the
  package, which can in principle be applied to Weyl modules for any
  simple, simply-connected algebraic group in any characteristic,
  subject of course to time and space limitations of computational
  resources.</description>

      <title>Countably compact inverse semigroups and Nyikos' problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A regular separable first-countable countably compact space is called a Nyikos space. In this paper, we give a partial solution to an old problem of Nyikos by showing that each locally compact Nyikos inverse topological semigroup is compact. Also, we show that a topological semigroup $S$ that contains a dense inverse subsemigroup is a topological inverse semigroup, provided (i) $S$ is compact, or (ii) $S$ is countably compact and sequential. The latter result solves a problem of Banakh and Pastukhova and provides the automatic continuity of inversion in certain compact-like inverse semigroups.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of zero singular ideal in \'etale groupoid C*-algebras via compressible maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the singular ideal in a non-Hausdorff \'etale groupoid C*-algebra is zero if and only if every unit is contained, at the level of group representation theory, in the collection of subgroups of the unit's isotropy group obtained as limit sets of nets in the "Hausdorff part" of the unit space. This is achieved through a study of the interplay between the Hausdorff cover and restriction maps on C*-algebras of groupoids to reductions by closed locally invariant subsets, which we show are compressible to *-homomorphisms and therefore have many of the same properties. We also prove a simpler algebraic characterization of zero singular ideal that holds whenever the isotropy group C*-algebras satisfy a certain ideal intersection property. We prove this property holds for all direct limits of virtually torsion free solvable groups.</description>
