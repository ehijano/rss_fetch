      <title>A compendium of cold-nuclear matter baseline predictions in light-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent light-ion collision programme at RHIC and the LHC provides a unique opportunity to investigate the onset of quark-gluon plasma formation and parton energy loss in small systems. A quantitative interpretation of emerging jet quenching measurements requires precise control over cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, which modify hard-process cross sections independently of any hot-medium dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive set of perturbative QCD baseline calculations for nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) in proton-oxygen (pO), oxygen-oxygen (OO) and neon-neon (NeNe) collisions at LHC energies. The study includes charged hadron, neutral pion, prompt photon, and electroweak-boson production computed at next-to-leading order using a broad set of recent nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). We demonstrate that CNM effects alone can induce sizeable suppressions in light-ion systems, with large associated nPDF uncertainties that currently limit the quantitative extraction of parton energy loss. To address this limitation, we explore a range of multi-cross-section ratios in which CNM effects and their uncertainties largely cancel. In particular, ratios of neutral pion $R_{OO}$ to prompt photon $R_{OO}$ or charged hadron $R_{OO}$ to $R_{pO}^2$ provide theoretically robust observables with substantially reduced nPDF uncertainties, thereby enhancing sensitivity to possible energy-loss signatures.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Production of Kaons on the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the electromagnetic production of strange quarks began in the 1950s as something of a curiosity that puzzled experimentalists and theorists alike. As the datasets increased, concomitant advances in theoretical models were realized. A paradigm shift occurred in the 1990s with the development of second-generation facilities at ELSA, MAMI, SPring-8, and JLab, which brought nuclear physics experiments forward by orders of magnitude in counting statistics compared to the first-generation efforts. This was an utter boon to strangeness physics investigations, and to date, more than 50 dedicated experiments in kaon photo- and electroproduction have been completed at facilities around the world, leading to a host of experimental observables that have enabled significant advances in the exploration of strongly interacting systems that decay via $s\bar{s}$ quark pair creation. This review was designed to provide the first-ever in-depth overview of both the experimental and theoretical progress in the field of the electromagnetic production of strangeness. This work looks back over 70 years of past developments, discusses ongoing work and near-term plans, and details future possibilities being considered for third-generation facilities. Throughout this work, the primary impacts of these explorations are highlighted, along with connections to a wide range of related phenomenological applications. An important goal of this review is to provide a complete, self-contained guide into this field prepared at a level that is relevant for both new and seasoned scientists, whether experimentalists, phenomenologists, or theorists, to better understand what has been accomplished by so many dedicated folks-each building on what has come before-and to appreciate the exciting future potential for continued studies in this area. A more complete abstract is provided in the paper.</description>

      <title>Rapidity dependence of mean transverse momentum fluctuation and decorrelation in baryon-dense medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the event-by-event fluctuation and rapidity decorrelation of the mean transverse momentum $\spt$, which has recently been proposed as a sensitive probe of the equation of state at finite baryon density. The investigation reveals that, in a baryon-rich medium, the event-by-event fluctuation of the mean transverse momentum is driven by the combined effects of energy-density and net-baryon-density fluctuations. Consequently, the rapidity dependence of this observable provides a promising handle to probe the three-dimensional structure of both energy and baryon density profiles. Previous studies have shown that $\spt$ decorrelation along rapidity is largely insensitive to shear and bulk viscosity; however, its dependence on baryon diffusion, another key transport coefficient in baryonic matter, has not been explored. I find that baryon diffusion has a negligible impact, establishing this observable as a robust probe of the equation of state. Furthermore, I present predictions for identified hadrons and observe a pronounced splitting in the rapidity decorrelation of mean transverse momentum between protons and antiprotons, indicating different transverse flow dynamics for baryons and antibaryons.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Pauli projection and supersymetric transformation methods for three-body nuclear structure and reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body Faddeev-type equations for bound, resonant, and scattering states in the systems of nuclear core and two nucleons are solved using the momentum-space framework. Two approaches for eliminating the Pauli-forbidden deeply-bound states are compared, projecting out those states by a nonlocal term in the potential, and by a supersymmetric transformation of the potential. While the former method is preferred by the experimental data for the deuteron-${}^4${He} scattering, the results for bound and resonant states do not indicate a clear superiority of a single method. Instead, systematic differences between them are found.</description>

      <title>The role of \nu_{\tau} ultrahigh energy astrophysics in Km^3 detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9704205</link>
      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9704205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We show that the expected $ \nu_{\tau} $ signals, by their secondary tau tracks, in Km^3 detectors at highest cosmic ray energy window $ 1.7\cdot 10^{21} eV \gt E_{\tau} \gt 1.6 x 10^{17} eV$, must overcome the corresponding $ \nu_{\mu} $ (or muonic) ones. Indeed, the Lorentz-boosted tau range length grows (linearly) above muon range, for $ E_{\tau} \RAISE 1.6 x 10^8 GeV$ and reaches its maxima extension, $ R_{\tau_{\max}} \simeq 191 km$, at energy $E_{\tau} \simeq 3.8 x 10^9 GeV$. At this peak the tau range is nearly 20 times the corresponding muon range (at the same energy) implying a similar ratio in $ \nu_{\tau} $ over $ \nu_{\mu} $ detectability. This dominance, however may lead (at present most abundant $ \nu_{\tau} $ model fluxes) to just a rare spectacular event a year (if flavor mixing occurs). Lower energetic $ \tau $ and $ \nu_{\tau} $ signals $ (\bar{\nu}_e e\to \bar{\nu}_{\tau} \tau, \nu_{\tau} N\to ...) $ at energy range ($ 10^5 \div 10^7 GeV$) may be more easily observed in km^3 detectors at a rate of a few $ (\bar{\nu}_e e\to \bar{\nu}_{\tau} \tau) $ to tens event $ (\nu_{\tau} N\to \tau + $ anything) a year.</description>

      <title>Dielectron production in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.11995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurements of dielectron production at midrapidity ($|\eta_{\rm e}|&lt;0.8$) in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV at the LHC are presented. The dielectron cross section is measured with the ALICE detector as a function of the invariant mass $m_{\rm{ee}}$ and the pair transverse momentum $p_{\rm{T,ee}}$ in the ranges $m_{\rm{ee}}$ &lt; 3.5 GeV/$c^{2}$ and $p_{\rm{T,ee}}$ &lt; 8.0 GeV/$c^{2}$, in both collision systems. In proton-proton collisions, the charm and beauty cross sections are determined at midrapidity from a fit to the data with two different event generators. This complements the existing dielectron measurements performed at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 13 TeV. The slope of the $\sqrt{s}$ dependence of the three measurements is described by FONLL calculations. The dielectron cross section measured in proton-lead collisions is in agreement, within the current precision, with the expected dielectron production without any nuclear matter effects for $\rm{e}^{+}\rm{e}^{-}$ pairs from open heavy-flavor hadron decays. For the first time at LHC energies, the dielectron production in proton-lead and proton-proton collisions are directly compared at the same $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ via the dielectron nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm{pPb}}$. The measurements are compared to model calculations including cold nuclear matter effects, or additional sources of dielectrons from thermal radiation.</description>

      <title>Measurement of isolated prompt photon production in pp and p-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the measurement of the isolated prompt photon inclusive production cross section in pp and p-Pb collisions by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The measurement is performed in p-Pb collisions at centre-of-mass energies per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV and $8.16$ TeV, as well as in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV and $8$ TeV. The cross section is obtained at midrapidity $(|y|&lt;0.7)$ using a charged-track based isolation momentum $p_{\rm T}^{\rm{iso, ch}} &lt; 1.5$ GeV/$c$ in a cone with radius $R=0.4$. The data for both collision systems are well reproduced by perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) using recent parton distribution functions for free (PDF) and bound (nPDF) nucleons. Furthermore, the nuclear modification factor $R_{\text{pA}}$ for both collision energies is consistent with unity for $p_{\rm T} &gt; 20$ GeV/$c$. However, deviations from unity ($R_{\rm pA}&lt;1$) of up to 20% are observed for $p_{\rm T} &lt; 20$ GeV/$c$ with limited significance, indicating the possible presence of nuclear effects in the initial state of the collision. The suppression increases with decreasing \pt with a significance of $2.3\sigma$ for a non-zero slope and yields $R_{\rm pA}&lt;1$ with a significance of $1.8\sigma$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 8.16$ TeV for $p_{\rm T} &lt; 20$ GeV/$c$. In addition, a significance of $1.1\sigma$ is observed for $R_{\rm pA}&lt;1$ at the lower collision energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV for $p_{\rm T} &lt; 14$ GeV/$c$. The magnitude and shape of the suppression are consistent with pQCD predictions at NLO using nPDFs that incorporate nuclear shadowing effects in the Pb nucleus.</description>

      <title>Observation of deuteron and antideuteron formation from resonance-decay nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy hadronic collisions generate environments characterized by temperatures above 100 MeV [1,2], about 100,000 times hotter than the center of the Sun. It is therefore currently unclear how light (anti)nuclei with mass number A of a few units, such as the deuteron, $^3$He, or $^4$He, each bound by only a few MeV, can emerge from these collisions [3,4]. The ALICE collaboration reports that deuteron-pion momentum correlations in proton-proton (pp) collisions provide model-independent evidence that about 90% of the observed (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear reactions [5] following the decay of short-lived resonances, such as the $\Delta (1232)$. These findings, obtained by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) resolve a gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in ultra-relativistic hadronic collisions. Beyond offering insights on how (anti)nuclei are formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be employed in the modeling of the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays [6] and dark matter decays [7,8].</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ cross-section ratio as function of multiplicity in $p$Pb collisions at$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production ratio of $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ charmonium states is presented as a function of multiplicity in proton-lead collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV, for both prompt and nonprompt sources. The total luminosity recorded by the LHCb experiment corresponds to 13.6 $pb^{-1}$ for $p$Pb collisions and 20.8 $pb^{-1}$ for Pb$p$ collisions, where the first particle indicates the forward direction of the detector. Measurements are performed in the dimuon final state at forward (backward) centre-of-mass rapidity $1.5&lt;y^*&lt;4.0$ ($-5.0&lt;y^*&lt;-2.5$) for $p$Pb (Pb$p$) collisions.A multiplicity dependence of the prompt production ratio is observed in $p$Pb collisions, whereas no dependence is found in nonprompt production, nor in either prompt or nonprompt production in Pb$p$ collisions. These results suggest that in the Pb-going direction additional suppression mechanisms beyond comover effects may be present, possibly related to the formation of quark-gluon plasma. This highlights a transition from small to large collision systems and provides important insight into the suppression of charmonia in proton-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>$\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ production in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13183</link>

Abstract: The transverse momentum spectra and integrated yields of anti-$\Sigma$ hyperons ($\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$) have been measured in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE experiment. Measurements are performed via the newly accessed decay channel $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm} \rightarrow {\rm\overline{n}}\pi^{\pm}$. A new method of antineutron reconstruction with the PHOS electromagnetic spectrometer is developed and applied to this analysis. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ are measured in the range $0.5 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 3$ GeV/$c$ and compared to predictions of the PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. The EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models provide the best descriptions of the measured spectra both in pp and p-Pb collisions, while models which do not account for multiparton interactions provide a considerably worse description at high $p_{\rm T}$. The total yields of $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ in both pp and p-Pb collisions are compared to predictions of the Thermal-FIST model and dynamical models PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4. All models reproduce the total yields in both colliding systems within uncertainties. The nuclear modification factors $R_\mathrm{pPb}$ for both $\overline{\Sigma}^{+}$ and $\overline{\Sigma}^{-}$ are evaluated and compared to those of protons, $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ hyperons, and predictions of EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. No deviations of $R_\mathrm{pPb}$ for $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ from the model predictions or measurements for other hadrons are found within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of f$_0$(980) production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependence of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production on the final-state charged-particle multiplicity is reported for proton-proton (pp) collisions at the centre-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The production of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) is measured with the ALICE detector via the $\mathrm{f}_0 (980) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel in a midrapidity region of $|y|&lt;0.5$. The evolution of the integrated yields and mean transverse momentum of f$_{0}$(980) as a function of charged-particle multiplicity measured in pp at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV follows the trends observed in pp at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. Particle yield ratios of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) to $\pi^{\pm}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ are found to decrease with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. These particle ratios are compared with calculations from the canonical statistical thermal model as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. The thermal model calculations provide a better description of the decreasing trend of particle ratios when no strange or antistrange quark composition for f$_{0}$(980) is assumed, which suggests that the data do not support significant hidden strangeness in the f$_{0}$(980).</description>

      <title>$\Sigma^{+}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of $\Sigma^{+}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV is presented. The measurement is performed at midrapidity in both minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The $\Sigma^{+}$ is reconstructed via its weak-decay topology in the decay channel $\Sigma^{+} \rightarrow \rm{p} + \pi^{0}$ with $\pi^{0} \rightarrow \gamma + \gamma$. In a novel approach, the neutral pion is reconstructed by combining photons that convert in the detector material with photons measured in the calorimeters. The transverse-momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distributions of the $\Sigma^{+}$ and its rapidity densities ${\rm d}N$/${\rm d}y$ in both event classes are reported. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectrum in minimum-bias collisions is compared to QCD-inspired event generators. The ratio of $\Sigma^{+}$ to previously measured $\Lambda$ baryons is in good agreement with calculations from the Statistical Hadronization Model. The high efficiency and purity of the novel reconstruction method for $\Sigma^{+}$ presented here will enable future studies of the interaction of $\Sigma^{+}$ with protons in the context of femtoscopic measurements, which could be crucial for understanding the equation of state of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Measurement of D($\gamma$, $n$)$p$ Photodisintegration Reaction and Implications for Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a high-precision measurement of the D($\gamma$,\,$n$)$p$ photodisintegration reaction at the newly commissioned Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source (SLEGS), employing a quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$-ray beam from Laser Compton Scattering. The cross sections were determined over $E_\gamma$=2.327--7.089 MeV, achieving up to a factor of 2.2 improvement in precision near the neutron separation threshold. Combined with previous data in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using dibaryon effective field theory, we obtained the unprecedentedly precise $p$($n$,\,$\gamma$)D cross sections and thermonuclear rate, with a precision up to $\approx$4 times higher than previous evaluations. Implemented in a standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework, this new rate decreases uncertainty of the key cosmological parameter of baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$ by up to $\approx$16\% relative to the LUNA result. A residual $\approx$1.2$\sigma$ tension between $\Omega_b h^2$ constrained from primordial D/H observations and CMB measurements persists, highlighting the need for improved $dd$ reaction rates and offering potential hints of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.</description>

Abstract: The femtoscopic study of pairs of identical pions is particularly suited to investigate the effective source function of particle emission, due to the resulting Bose-Einstein correlation signal. In small collision systems at the LHC, pp in particular, the majority of the pions are produced in resonance decays, which significantly affect the profile and size of the source. In this work, we explicitly model this effect in order to extract the primordial source in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV from charged $\pi - \pi$ correlations measured by ALICE. We demonstrate that the assumption of a Gaussian primordial source is compatible with the data and that the effective source, resulting from modifications due to resonances, is approximately exponential, as found in previous measurements at the LHC. The universality of hadron emission in pp collisions is further investigated by applying the same methodology to characterize the primordial source of K$-$p pairs. The size of the primordial source is evaluated as a function of the transverse mass ($m_{\rm T}$) of the pairs, leading to the observation of a common scaling for both $\pi - \pi$ and K$-$p, suggesting a collective effect. Further, the present results are compatible with the $m_{\rm T}$ scaling of the p$-$p and p$-\Lambda$ primordial source measured by ALICE in high multiplicity pp collisions, providing additional evidence for the presence of a common emission source for all hadrons in small collision systems at the LHC. This will allow the determination of the source function for any hadron-hadron pairs with high precision, granting access to the properties of the possible final-state interaction among pairs of less abundantly produced hadrons, such as strange or charmed particles.</description>

      <title>Commissioning the Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy Experiment at FRIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript reports on the commissioning of the Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy Experiment (RISE) at the BECOLA facility at FRIB. The new instrument implements the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of short-lived isotopes produced at FRIB. The existing BECOLA beamline was extended to integrate an electrostatic ion-beam bender and an ion detector at ultra-high vacuum. An injection-seeded Ti:Sapphire laser and a multi-harmonic pulsed Nd:YAG laser were installed to perform resonant excitation and selective ionization. Commissioning tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrument by measuring the hyperfine structure of stable $^{27}$Al produced in an offline ion source. The RISE instrument is ready and operational for future studies of short-lived isotopes at FRIB.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon: status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the status of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as a precision probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) after the release of the final results from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Muon $g-2$ experiment and the second White Paper of the Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative. While the SM prediction requires further improvements by a factor of four to fully leverage the sensitivity achieved in experiment, the FNAL measurement will set the standard for many years to come, and we discuss a variety of features of the experimental campaign that made this achievement possible. In going forward, we discuss current efforts to improve the SM prediction, and imagine how an experiment would have to be devised to surpass 124 ppb in precision.</description>

      <title>The collectivity of transverse momentum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the observable $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change of $p_T$ spectra induced by event-by-event density fluctuations in the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. This quantity provides a direct measure of radial flow and serves as a probe of collectivity, complementing anisotropic flow coefficients. Using hydrodynamic model calculations, we predict the behavior of $v_0(p_T)$ and show that the scaled quantity $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ exhibits very little dependence on centrality and transport coefficients. We further find that the apparent influence of transport coefficients$-$particularly bulk viscosity$-$ on $v_0(p_T)$ largely originates from modifications of the event-averaged mean transverse momentum, $\langle p_T \rangle$. By expressing $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ as a function of $p_T/\langle p_T \rangle$, the genuine sensitivity of $v_0(p_T)$ to transport coefficients can be isolated. Moreover, since $v_0(p_T)$ is the $p_T$-differential measure of event-by-event $[p_T]$ fluctuations, it naturally explains the observed $p_T$-cut dependence of $\sigma_{p_T}$ measured by ATLAS collaboration.</description>
