      <title>Sources of low-frequency $\delta^{18}$O variability in coastal ice cores from Dronning Maud Land</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-frequency variability of the $\delta^{18}$O recorded in ice cores (FK17 and TIR18) recently drilled at two different locations in Dronning Maud Land (Antarctica), is investigated using multi-taper spectral method and singular spectrum analysis. Multiple dominant peaks emerge in these records with periods between 3 and 20 years. The two sites show distinct spectral signatures, despite their relative proximity in space (about 100 km apart), suggesting that different processes are involved in generating the variability at these two sites. In order to clarify which processes are acting on $\delta^{18}$O at these two locations, the impact of several climate indices as well as sea ice area is investigated using a causal method, known as the Liang-Kleeman rate of information transfer. The analysis of the origin of this low-frequency variability from external sources reveals that El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the Dipole Mode Index (DMI) and the sea ice area display important causal influences on $\delta^{18}$O at FK17. For TIR18, the main influences are from ENSO, PDO, DMI, the sea ice area, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), revealing the complexity of the interactions in Dronning Maud Land. The two locations share several drivers, but also show local specificities potentially linked to ocean proximity and differences in air mass trajectories. The implication of these findings on the low-frequency variability in the two ice cores is discussed.</description>

      <title>Pr\'evisions m\'et\'eorologiques bas\'ees sur l'intelligence artificielle : une r\'evolution peut en cacher une autre</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), based on deep-learning algorithm using high-quality reanalysis datasets, is showing enormous potential for weather forecasting. In this context, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is developing a new forecasting system based on AI. Verification results of deterministic forecast for now are promising. However, the realism of weather forecasts based on AI is often questioned. Here, different types of realism are identified and we discuss, in particular, the relationship between structural realism and predictability of weather events. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of deterministic forecasts based on AI points to a realism/performance dilemma that a probabilistic approach should help to solve. -- L'intelligence artificielle (IA) bouleverse aujourd'hui le monde de la pr\'evision m\'et\'eorologique avec l'utilisation d'algorithmes d'apprentissage profond nourris par des champs de r\'eanalyses. Dans ce contexte, le Centre Europ\'een pour les Pr\'evisions M\'et\'eorologiques \`a Moyen Terme (CEPMMT) a d\'ecid\'e de d\'evelopper un nouveau syst\`eme de pr\'evisions resposant sur l'IA. Ces pr\'evisions, pour le moment de type d\'eterministe, montrent des r\'esultats prometteurs. Toutefois, le r\'ealisme de ce type de pr\'evisions reposant sur l'IA est souvent questionn\'e. Ici, nous identifions diff\'erents types de r\'ealisme et interrogeons notamment le rapport entre r\'ealisme structurel et pr\'evisibilit\'e des \'ev\^enements m\'et\'eorologiques. Une analyse statistique de pr\'evisions d\'eterministes reposant sur l'IA laisse apparaitre un dilemme r\'ealisme/performance qu'une approche probabiliste devrait aider \`a r\'esoudre.</description>

      <title>Mid-latitude interactions expand the Hadley circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hadley circulation describes a planetary-scale tropical atmospheric flow, which has a major influence on climate. Contemporary theoretical understanding is based upon angular momentum conservation, the basic dynamical constraint governing the state of the flow pattern. However, despite the degree of success in representing the Hadley circulation, the canonical theoretical model does not treat interactions with other regions, particularly the mid-latitudes. Here, we extend the original model of Held and Hou (1980) to include the influence of mid-latitude large-scale atmospheric dynamics, which we treat using the planetary-scale heat equation with a parameterized poleward heat flux driven by synoptic eddies. The energy flux balance within the Hadley cell includes the poleward heat flux at the poleward edge of the cell, which is controlled by the baroclinic instability of the sub-tropical jet. We find that an increase (decrease) in the poleward heat flux leads to a strengthening (weakening) of tropical convection, driving an equatorward (poleward) shift of the edge of the Hadley cell. Thus, our theoretical solutions suggest that global warming, which can reduce the baroclinicity of the subtropical jet, can lead to the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell due to the change in energy flux balance within it.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Kolmogorov like scalings and multifractality in the rainfall events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed statistical analysis related to the characterization of the spatial and temporal fluctuations present in the rainfall patterns of North-East region ($26.05^{\circ}N-26.95^{\circ}N$, $88.05^{\circ}E-94.95^{\circ}E$) of India using half hourly rainfall data over the last 20 years for the range 2001-2020. We analyze the nature of the distribution by computing the mean, second moment of the fluctuation, skewness and kurtosis of the temporal rainfall data that indicate the presence of heavy tail in the right skewed distribution a typical feature of the presence of rare events. We find that the temporal distribution of the rainfall data follow the multiplicative Log-Normal probability distribution. Further we compute the spatial and temporal correlation of the rainfall in this region indicate that the rainfall events are correlated in the spatial direction of about 70 Km. The Power spectral density of temporal rainfall shows power law behaviour with frequency with an exponent $\sim -1.5$ close to the Kolmogorov exponent ($-1.67$) exhibited for the turbulent passive scalar driven by the mean flow. Our wavelet analysis reveals the evidence of multiple frequencies in the rainfall pattern which can attributed to different short and long range factors responsible for the rainfall. We have also used the Hilbert Huang transformation to identify the frequencies corresponding fluctuating part of the rainfall time series. Using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, finally we establish the multifractal nature of the rainfall pattern with Hurst exponent close to $0.65$ .</description>

Abstract: In this scientific article, the data on air pollution by PM2.5 particulate matter was evaluated in different locations in the city of Cusco with respect to the Environmental Quality Indexes (INCA) of the Ministry of the Environment of the Peruvian Government. The results show that air pollution in the city of Cusco is an environmental risk problem. More than 84% of the monitored sites have a bad rating (101-500), the corresponding color is orange. This result shows that the air that citizens of Cusco breathe is of poor quality and the population could experience health problems. The recommendation is to avoid outdoor exercises and activities. In the district of San Jeronimo Cusco, the average concentration has been 125 ug/m3, which corresponds to the INCA interval of more than 125, within the red color threshold for care. The health effects are described as chronic lung and cardiovascular diseases, and the health authority should declare levels of alert. It has been concluded that according to INCA, the air in the city of Cusco is of poor quality and falls within the threshold of the Care State Value (VUEC).</description>

      <title>Simulating the aftermath of Northern European Enclosure Dam (NEED) break and flooding of European coast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Northern European Enclosure Dam (NEED) is a hypothetical project to prevent flooding in European countries following the rising ocean level due to melting arctic glaciers. This project involves the construction of two large dams between Scotland and Norway, as well as England and France. The anticipated cost of this project is 250 to 500 billion euros. In this paper, we present the simulation of the aftermath of flooding on the European coastline caused by a catastrophic break of this hypothetical dam. From our simulation results, we can observe that there is a traveling wave after the accident, with a velocity of around 10 kilometers per hour, raising the sea level permanently inside the dammed region. This observation implies a need to construct additional dams or barriers protecting the northern coastline of the Netherlands and the interior of the Baltic Sea. Our simulations have been obtained using the following building blocks. First, a graph transformation model was applied to generate an adaptive mesh approximating the topography of the Earth. We employ the composition graph grammar model for breaking triangular elements in the mesh without the generation of hanging nodes. Second, the wave equation is formulated in a spherical latitude-longitude system of coordinates and solved by a high-order time integration scheme using the generalized $\alpha$ method.</description>

      <title>Trigger mechanism for a singing cavitating tip vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete tone radiated from tip vortex cavitation (TVC), known as 'vortex singing', was recognized in 1989, but its triggering remains unclear for over thirty years. In this study, the desinent cavitation number and viscous correction are applied to describe the dynamics of cavitation bubbles and the dispersion relation of cavity interfacial waves. The wavenumber-frequency spectrum of the cavity radius from the experiment in CSSRC indicates that singing waves predominantly consist of the stationary double helical modes (k{\theta} = 2- and -2+) and the breathing mode (k{\theta} = 0-), rather than standing waves as assumed in previous literatures. Moreover, two trigger mechanisms, expressed by two triggering lines, are proposed: the twisted TVC, initially at rest, is driven into motion through the corrected natural frequency (fn) due to the step change of the far-field pressure. Subsequently, the frequency associated with the zero-group-velocity point (fzgv) at k{\theta} = 0- is excited through fi, the frequency at the intersection of dispersion curves at k{\theta} = 0- and -2+, or fj, the frequency at the intersection of dispersion curves at k{\theta} = 0- and 2-, corresponding to two types of the vortex singing triggering. These solutions, without empirical parameters, are validated using singing conditions provided by CSSRC and G.T.H., respectively. Furthermore, the coherence and the cross-power spectral density spectrum indicates a large-scale breathing wave propagating along the singing cavity surface and travelling from downstream to hydrofoil tip, providing us a comprehensive understanding for the triggering of vortex singing.</description>

      <title>The best whistler: a cavitating tip vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete tone radiated from a cavitating tip vortex, known as "vortex singing", was first recognized in 1989, but its sound generation mechanism has remained a mystery for over thirty years. In this letter, by means of the correction for the cavitation bubble dynamics and the dispersion relation of cavity interfacial waves, we found that after the far-end disturbances propagate upstream, the whistling vortex should be triggered by near-end sound sources, the breathing mode waves. Further utilizing the theoretical solutions for singing lines and the potential singing cavitation number with frequency, we accurately identified all available tests for seeking the vortex singing over the past three decades, answering a long-standing perplexity: why such a best whistler is able to appear only within a narrow range of the cavitation number.</description>

      <title>On the departure from Monin-Obukhov surface similarity and transition to the convective mixed layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-eddy simulations are used to evaluate mean profile similarity in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Particular care is taken regarding the grid sensitivity of the profiles and the mitigation of inertial oscillations in the simulation spin-up. The nondimensional gradients $\phi$ for wind speed and air temperature generally align with Monin-Obukhov similarity across cases but have a steeper slope than predicted within each profile. The same trend has been noted in several other recent studies. The Businger-Dyer relations are modified here with an exponential cutoff term to account for the decay in $\phi$ to first-order approximation, yielding improved similarity from approximately 0.05$z_i$ to above 0.3$z_i$, where $z_i$ is the CBL depth. The necessity for the exponential correction is attributed to an extended transition from surface scaling to zero gradient in the mixed layer, where the departure from Monin-Obukhov similarity may be negligible at the surface but becomes substantial well below the conventional surface layer height of 0.1$z_i$.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal spectral transfers in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>
