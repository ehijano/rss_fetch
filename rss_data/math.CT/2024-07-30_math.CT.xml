      <title>The right cancellation property for certain classes of dendroidal anodynes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a previous result of Stevenson to the category of dendroidal sets, yielding the right cancellation property of dendroidal inner anodynes within the class of normal monomorphisms. As an application of this property, we show how to construct a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathsf{Env}(X)^\otimes$ from a dendroidal $\infty$-operad $X$, in a way that generalizes the symmetric monoidal envelope of a coloured operad.</description>

      <title>Pseudocolimits of Small Filtered Diagrams of Internal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudocolimits are formal gluing constructions that combine objects in a category indexed by a pseudofunctor. When the objects are categories and the domain of the pseudofunctor is small and filtered it has been known since Exppose 6 in SGA4 that the pseudocolimit can be computed by taking the Grothendieck construction of the pseudofunctor and inverting the class of cartesian arrows with respect to the canonical fibration. This paper is a reformatted version of a MSc thesis submitted and defended at Dalhousie University in August 2022. The first part presents a set of conditions for defining an internal category of elements of a diagram of internal categories and proves it is the oplax colimit. The second part presents a set of conditions on an ambient category and an internal category with an object of weak-equivalences that allows an internal description of the axioms for a category of (right) fractions and a definition of the internal category of (right) fractions when all the conditions and axioms are satisfied. These are combined to present a suitable context for computing the pseudocolimit of a small filtered diagram of internal categories.</description>

      <title>Internal 1-topoi in 2-topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further develop Weber's notion of elementary 2-topos by proposing certain new axioms. We show that in a 2-category C satisfying these axioms, the "discrete opfibration (DOF) classifier" S is always an internal elementary 1-topos, in an appropriate sense. The axioms introduced for this purpose are closure conditions on the DOFs having "S-small fibres". Among these closure conditions, the most interesting one asserts that a certain DOF, analogous to the "subset fibration" over Set, has small fibres.
  The remaining new axioms concern "groupoidal" objects in a 2-category, which are seen to play a significant role in the general theory. We prove two results to the effect that a 2-category C satisfying these axioms is "determined by" its groupoidal objects: the first shows that C is equivalent to a 2-category of internal categories built out of groupoidal objects, and the second shows that the groupoidal objects are dense in C.</description>

      <title>Injective generation for graded rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate injective generation for graded rings. We first examine the relation between injective generation and graded injective generation for graded rings. We then reduce the study of injective generation for graded rings to the study of injective generation for certain Morita context rings and we provide sufficient conditions for injective generation of the latter. We then provide necessary and sufficient conditions so that injectives generate for tensor rings and for trivial extension rings. We provide two proofs for the class of tensor rings, the one uses covering theory and the other uses the framework of cleft extensions of module categories. We finally prove injective generation for twisted tensor products of finite dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of schemes from their \'{e}tale topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field that is finitely generated over its prime field. In Grothendieck's anabelian letter to Faltings, he conjectured that sending a $k$-scheme to its \'{e}tale topos defines a fully faithful functor from the localization of the category of finite type $k$-schemes at the universal homeomorphisms to a category of topoi. We prove Grothendieck's conjecture for infinite fields of arbitrary characteristic. In characteristic $0$, this shows that seminormal finite type $k$-schemes can be reconstructed from their \'{e}tale topoi, generalizing work of Voevodsky. In positive characteristic, this shows that perfections of finite type $k$-schemes can be reconstructed from their \'{e}tale topoi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature) and (b) algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>

      <title>Higher Verlinde Categories: The Mixed Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, the higher Verlinde categories $\mathrm{Ver}_{p^n}$ are obtained by taking the abelian envelope of a quotient of the category of tilting modules for the algebraic group $\mathrm{SL}_2$. These symmetric tensor categories have been introduced in arXiv:2003.10499 &amp; arXiv:2003.10105, and their properties have been extensively studied in the former reference. In arXiv:2105.07724, the above construction for $\mathrm{SL}_2$ has been generalized to Lusztig's quantum group for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and root of unity $\zeta$, which produces the mixed higher Verlinde categories $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$. Inspired by the results of arXiv:2003.10499, we study the properties of these braided tensor categories in detail. In particular, we establish a Steinberg tensor product formula for the simple objects of $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, construct a braided embedding $\mathrm{Ver}_{p^n}\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n+1)}}$, compute the symmetric center of $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, and identify its Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>Almost mathematics of pointed symmetric monoidal model categories by Smith ideal theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04541v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a generalization of a result in Quillen's note ``Module theory over non-unital rings'' giving a one-to-one correspondence between bilocalization of abelian categories of modules and idempotent ideals of the base ring. Faltings; Gabber and Ramero established almost mathematics, the same as Quillen's bilocalization of a category of modules by nil modules. In this paper, by using the theory of Smith ideals mentioned in Hovey and Smith, we consider almost mathematics of symmetric monoidal pointed model categories. We prove a weak analogue of the one-to-one correspondence in Quillen.</description>

Abstract: This note remarks that the correspondence between non-unital algebras and augmented unital algebras can be derived from Hovey's Smith ideal theory. Applying Smith ideal theory of stable symmetric monoidal model category, we formulate non-unital algebra objects of stable symmetric monoidal model categories and generalize the correspondence between non-unital algebra objects and augmented algebra objects.</description>

      <title>On the axiomitization of an optimal noetherian form over the category of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A noetherian form is an abstract self-dual framework suitable for establishing homomorphism theorems (such as the isomorphism theorems and homological diagram lemmas) for non-abelian, as well as abelian, group-like structures. It can be seen as a unification of semi-abelian categories and Grandis exact categories (two separate generalisations of abelian categories) that retains the self-dual character of Grandis exact categories. In this paper we axiomatise a noetherian form over the category of sets, which, in a suitable sense, is an optimal noetherian form. We then show that every topos has such noetherian form as well, while in the context of a pointed category with finite products and sums, the dual of such noetherian form is exactly the form of subobjects of a semi-abelian category.</description>

      <title>A category of arrow algebras for modified realizability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we further the study of arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures inducing toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction, by defining appropriate notions of morphisms between them which correspond to morphisms of the associated triposes. Specializing to geometric inclusions, we characterize subtriposes of an arrow tripos in terms of nuclei on the underlying arrow algebra, recovering a classical locale-theoretic result. As an example of application, we lift modified realizability to the setting of arrow algebras, and we establish its functoriality.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld-Lau Descent over Fibered Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal X}$ be a category fibered in groupoids over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $k$ be an algebraically closed field containing $\mathbb{F}_q$. Denote by $\phi_k\colon {\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal X}_k$ the arithmetic Frobenius of ${\mathcal X}_k/k$ and suppose that ${\mathcal M}$ is a stack over $\mathbb{F}_q$ (not necessarily in groupoids). Then there is a natural functor $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}\colon{\mathcal M}({\mathcal X})\to{\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$, where ${\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$ is the category of $\phi_k$-invariant maps ${\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal M}$. A version of Drinfeld's lemma states that if ${\mathcal X}$ is a projective scheme and ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves of finite presentation, then $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence.
  We extend this result in several directions. For proper algebraic stacks or affine gerbes ${\mathcal X}$, we prove Drinfeld's lemma and deduce that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence for very general algebraic stacks ${\mathcal M}$.
  For arbitrary ${\mathcal X}$, we show that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence when ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of immersions, the stack of quasi-compact separated \'etale morphisms or any quasi-separated Deligne-Mumford stack with separated diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study unital $\infty$-operads by their arity restrictions. Given $k \geq 1$, we develop a model for unital $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads, which are variants of $\infty$-operads which has only $(\leq k)$-arity morphisms, as complete Segal presheaves on closed $k$-dendroidal trees, which are closed trees build from corollas with valences $\leq k$. Furthermore, we prove that the restriction functors from unital $\infty$-operads to unital $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads admit fully faithful left and right adjoints by showing that the left and right Kan extensions preserve complete Segal objects. Varying $k$, the left and right adjoints give a filtration and a co-filtration for any unital $\infty$-operads by $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads.</description>

Abstract: Let $T$ be a first-order theory. A correspondence is established between internal covers of models of $T$ and definable groupoids within $T$. We also consider amalgamations of independent diagrams of algebraically closed substructures, and find strong relation between: covers, uniqueness for 3-amalgamation, existence of 4-amalgamation, imaginaries of $T^\si$, and definable groupoids. As a corollary, we describe the imaginary elements of families of finite-dimensional vector spaces over pseudo-finite fields.</description>
