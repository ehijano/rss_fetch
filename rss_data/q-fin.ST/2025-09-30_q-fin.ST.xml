      <title>STRAPSim: A Portfolio Similarity Metric for ETF Alignment and Portfolio Trades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring portfolio similarity is critical for a wide range of financial applications, including Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) recommendation, portfolio trading, and risk alignment. Existing similarity measures often rely on exact asset overlap or static distance metrics, which fail to capture similarities among the constituents (e.g., securities within the portfolio) as well as nuanced relationships between partially overlapping portfolios with heterogeneous weights. We introduce STRAPSim (Semantic, Two-level, Residual-Aware Portfolio Similarity), a novel method that computes portfolio similarity by matching constituents based on semantic similarity, weighting them according to their portfolio share, and aggregating results via residual-aware greedy alignment. We benchmark our approach against Jaccard, weighted Jaccard, as well as BERTScore-inspired variants across public classification, regression, and recommendation tasks, as well as on corporate bond ETF datasets. Empirical results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in predictive accuracy and ranking alignment, achieving the highest Spearman correlation with return-based similarity. By leveraging constituent-aware matching and dynamic reweighting, portfolio similarity offers a scalable, interpretable framework for comparing structured asset baskets, demonstrating its utility in ETF benchmarking, portfolio construction, and systematic execution.</description>

      <title>From Headlines to Holdings: Deep Learning for Smarter Portfolio Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning offers new tools for portfolio optimization. We present an end-to-end framework that directly learns portfolio weights by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal patterns, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture evolving inter-stock relationships, and sentiment analysis of financial news to reflect market psychology. Unlike prior approaches, our model unifies these elements in a single pipeline that produces daily allocations. It avoids the traditional two-step process of forecasting asset returns and then applying mean--variance optimization (MVO), a sequence that can introduce instability. We evaluate the framework on nine U.S. stocks spanning six sectors, chosen to balance sector diversity and news coverage. In this setting, the model delivers higher cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios than equal-weighted and CAPM-based MVO benchmarks. Although the stock universe is limited, the results underscore the value of integrating price, relational, and sentiment signals for portfolio management and suggest promising directions for scaling the approach to larger, more diverse asset sets.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in Bitcoin Realised Volatility: Implications for Rough Volatility Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the applicability of rough volatility models to Bitcoin realized volatility using the normalised p-variation framework of Cont and Das (2024). Applying this model-free estimator to high-frequency Bitcoin data from 2017 to 2024 across multiple sampling resolutions, we find that the normalised statistic remains strictly negative, precluding the estimation of a valid roughness index. Stationarity tests and robustness checks reveal no significant evidence of non-stationarity or structural breaks as explanatory factors. Instead, convergent evidence from three complementary diagnostics, namely Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, log-log moment scaling, and wavelet leaders, reveals a multifractal structure in Bitcoin volatility. This behaviour violates the homogeneity assumptions underlying rough volatility estimation and accounts for the estimator's systematic failure. These findings suggest that while rough volatility models perform well in traditional markets, they are structurally misaligned with the empirical features of Bitcoin volatility.</description>
