      <title>A Type-Theoretic Definition of Lax $(\infty,\infty)$-Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a purely syntactic notion of lax cones and $(\infty,\infty)$-limits on finite computads in \texttt{CaTT}, a type theory for $(\infty,\infty)$-categories due to Finster and Mimram. Conveniently, finite computads are precisely the contexts in \texttt{CaTT}. We define a cone over a context to be a context, which is obtained by induction over the list of variables of the underlying context. In the case where the underlying context is globular we give an explicit description of the cone and conjecture that an analogous description continues to hold also for general contexts. We use the cone to control the types of the term constructors for the universal cone. The implementation of the universal property follows a similar line of ideas. Starting with a cone as a context, a set of context extension rules produce a context with the shape of a transfor between cones, i.e.~a higher morphism between cones. As in the case of cones, we use this context as a template to control the types of the term constructor required for universal property.</description>

      <title>A remark on fibrancy of ($\mbox{A$_{\infty}$Cat}$,$W^{\tiny\mbox{A}_{\infty}}_{\tiny\mbox{qe}}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we prove the existence, in the category of (strictly unital) A$_{\infty}$categories, of the pullback of a (strictly unital) A$_{\infty}$functor, satisfying a particular property (denoted by F1), along any A$_{\infty}$functor. As a consequence we provide a positive answer to Pascaleff's question whether (A$_{\infty}$Cat,$W^{\tiny\mbox{A}_{\infty}}_{\tiny\mbox{qe}}$) is a fibrant object in RelCat.</description>

      <title>Homological stratification and descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of stratification for big tensor-triangulated categories relative to the homological spectrum and develop the fundamental features of this theory. In particular, we demonstrate that it exhibits excellent descent properties. In conjunction with Balmer's Nerves of Steel conjecture, we conclude that stratification admits a general form of descent. This gives a uniform treatment of several recent stratification results and provides a complete answer to the question: When does stratification descend? As a new application, we extend earlier work on the tensor triangular geometry of equivariant module spectra from finite groups to compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Presenting Profunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by problems in categorical database theory, we introduce and compare two notions of presentation for profunctors, uncurried and curried, which arise intuitively from thinking of profunctors either as functors $\mathcal{C}^\text{op} \times \mathcal{D} \to \textbf{Set}$ or $\mathcal{C}^\text{op} \to \textbf{Set}^{\mathcal{D}}$. Although the Cartesian closure of $\textbf{Cat}$ means these two perspectives can be used interchangeably at the semantic level, a surprising amount of subtlety is revealed when looking through the lens of syntax. Indeed, we prove that finite uncurried presentations are strictly more expressive than finite curried presentations, hence the two notions do not induce the same class of finitely presentable profunctors. Moreover, an explicit construction for the composite of two curried presentations shows that the class of finitely curried presentable profunctors is closed under composition, in contrast with the larger class of finitely uncurried presentable profunctors, which is not. This shows that curried profunctor presentations are more appropriate for computational tasks that use profunctor composition. We package our results on curried profunctor presentations into a double equivalence from a syntactic double category into the double category of profunctors. Finally, we study the relationship between curried and uncurried presentations, leading to the introduction of curryable presentations. These constitute a subcategory of uncurried presentations which is equivalent to the category of curried presentations, therefore acting as a bridge between the two syntactic choices.</description>

      <title>Proxy-small objects present compactly generated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a correspondence between presentations of compactly generated triangulated categories as localizations of derived categories of ring spectra and proxy-small objects, and explore some consequences. In addition, we give a characterization of proxy-smallness in terms of coproduct preservation of the associated corepresentable functor `up to base change'.</description>

      <title>Double Glueing over Free Exponential: with Measure Theoretic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a compact method to lift the free exponential construction of Mellies-Tabareau-Tasson over the Hyland-Schalk double glueing for orthogonality categories. A condition ``reciprocity of orthogonality'' is presented simply enough to lift the free exponential over the double glueing in terms of the orthogonality. Our general method applies to the monoidal category TsK of the s-finite transition kernels with countable biproducts. We show (i) TsK^op has the free exponential, which is shown to be describable in terms of measure theory. (ii) The s-finite transition kernels have an orthogonality between measures and measurable functions in terms of Lebesgue integrals. The orthogonality is reciprocal, hence the free exponential of (i) lifts to the orthogonality category O_I(TsK^op), which subsumes Ehrhard et al's probabilistic coherent spaces as a full subcategory of countable measurable spaces. To lift the free exponential, the measure-theoretic uniform convergence theorem commuting Lebesgue integral and limit plays a crucial role as well as Fubini-Tonelli theorem for double integral in s-finiteness. Our measure-theoretic orthogonality is considered as a continuous version of the orthogonality of the probabilistic coherent spaces for linear logic, and in particular provides a two layered decomposition of Crubille et al's direct free exponential for these spaces.</description>
