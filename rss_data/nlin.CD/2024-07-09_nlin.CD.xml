      <title>Classical and Quantum Physical Reservoir Computing for Onboard Artificial Intelligence Systems: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems of autonomous systems such as drones, robots and self-driving cars may consume up to 50% of total power available onboard, thereby limiting the vehicle's range of functions and considerably reducing the distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge. Next-generation onboard AI systems need an even higher power since they collect and process even larger amounts of data in real time. This problem cannot be solved using the traditional computing devices since they become more and more power-consuming. In this review article, we discuss the perspectives of development of onboard neuromorphic computers that mimic the operation of a biological brain using nonlinear-dynamical properties of natural physical environments surrounding autonomous vehicles. Previous research also demonstrated that quantum neuromorphic processors (QNPs) can conduct computations with the efficiency of a standard computer while consuming less than 1% of the onboard battery power. Since QNPs is a semi-classical technology, their technical simplicity and low, compared with quantum computers, cost make them ideally suitable for application in autonomous AI system. Providing a perspective view on the future progress in unconventional physical reservoir computing and surveying the outcomes of more than 200 interdisciplinary research works, this article will be of interest to a broad readership, including both students and experts in the fields of physics, engineering, quantum technologies and computing.</description>

      <title>Coupled Stochastic-Statistical Equations for Filtering Multiscale Turbulent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new strategy for filtering high-dimensional multiscale systems characterized by high-order non-Gaussian statistics using observations from leading-order moments. A closed stochastic-statistical modeling framework suitable for systematic theoretical analysis and efficient numerical simulations is designed. Optimal filtering solutions are derived based on the explicit coupling structures of stochastic and statistical equations subject to linear operators, which satisfy an infinite-dimensional Kalman-Bucy filter with conditional Gaussian dynamics. To facilitate practical implementation, we develop a finite-dimensional stochastic filter model that approximates the optimal filter solution. We prove that this approximating filter effectively captures key non-Gaussian features, demonstrating consistent statistics with the optimal filter first in its analysis step update, then at the long-time limit guaranteeing stable convergence to the optimal filter. Finally, we build a practical ensemble filter algorithm based on the approximating filtering model, which enables accurate recovery of the true model statistics. The proposed modeling and filtering strategies are applicable to a wide range challenging problems in science and engineering, particularly for statistical prediction and uncertainty quantification of multiscale turbulent states.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of quasipotentials via a combined data-driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide range of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vortex reversal is a precursor of confined bacterial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active turbulence, or chaotic self-organized collective motion, is often observed in concentrated suspensions of motile bacteria and other systems of self-propelled interacting agents. To date, there is no fundamental understanding of how geometrical confinement orchestrates active turbulence and alters its physical properties. Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have discovered a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well's radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.</description>

      <title>Onset of Identical Synchronization in the Spatial Evolution of Optical Power in a Waveguide Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the spatial evolution of optical power in a closed-form optical waveguide configuration consisting of six passive waveguides and each of the waveguides exhibits equal strength of Kerr nonlinearity. We considered only nearest neighbor interaction between the waveguides. We found that in the case of low Kerr nonlinearity, evolution of optical power shows synchronization behavior. But when we increased the strength of Kerr nonlinearity, we discovered that spatial evolution of optical power in all waveguides shows independent characteristics. On the other hand, we have studied the impact of the coupling constant on the synchronization dynamics of our system. Our findings showed us that strong coupling can strengthen the collective dynamics in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. From our results, we can conclude that Kerr nonlinearity in our system plays the role of disorder parameter that destroys as well as alters the synchronization behavior of evolution of optical power in the waveguides and coupling constant plays the role of an antagonist and restores synchronization in the model.</description>
