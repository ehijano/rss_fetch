      <title>Cross-feeding percolation phase transitions of inter-cellular metabolic networks</title>

Abstract: Intercellular exchange networks are essential for the adaptive capabilities of populations of cells. While diffusional exchanges have traditionally been difficult to map, recent advances in nanotechnology enable precise probing of exchange fluxes with the medium at single-cell resolution. Here we introduce a tiling-based method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of exchange networks from flux data, subsequently applying it to an experimental mammalian co-culture system where lactate exchanges affect the acidification of the environment. We observe that the network, which initially exhibits a dense matrix of exchanges, progressively breaks up into small disconnected clusters of cells. To explain this behaviour, we develop a two-parameter Maximum-Entropy multicellular metabolic model that incorporates diffusion-driven exchanges through a set of global constraints that couple cellular behaviors. The model predicts a transition from a densely interconnected network to a sparse, motif-dominated state as glucose and oxygen consumption levels shift. We characterize such a crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution at the critical transition, and analytically, by computing the critical line through a mean-field approximation based on percolation theory. By comparing empirical data with theoretical predictions, we find that populations evolve towards the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover point between these two regimes. These findings offer new insights into the collective organization driving the adaptive dynamics of cell populations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven theory reveals protrusion and polarity interactions governing collision behavior of distinct motile cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on 14 candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, protrusion, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>
