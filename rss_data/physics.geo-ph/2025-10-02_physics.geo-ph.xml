      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Quantifying Nonlinear Uncertainty Propagation in Eddy Identification Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean eddies are swirling mesoscale features that play a fundamental role in oceanic transport and mixing. Eddy identification relies on diagnostic criteria that are inherently nonlinear functions of the flow variables. However, estimating the ocean flow field is subject to uncertainty due to its turbulent nature and the use of sparse and noisy observations. This uncertainty interacts with nonlinear diagnostics, complicating its quantification and limiting the accuracy of eddy identification. In this paper, an analytically tractable mathematical and computational framework for studying eddy identification is developed. It aims to address how uncertainty interacts with the nonlinearity in the eddy diagnostics and how the uncertainty in the eddy diagnostics is reduced when additional information from observations is incorporated. The framework employs a simple stochastic model for the flow field that mimics turbulent dynamics, allowing closed-form solutions for assessing uncertainty in eddy statistics. It also leverages a nonlinear, yet analytically tractable, data assimilation scheme to incorporate observations, facilitating the study of uncertainty reduction in eddy identification, which is quantified rigorously using information theory. Applied to the Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter, a widely used eddy diagnostic criterion, the framework leads to three key results. First, closed formulae reveal inhomogeneous spatial patterns in the OW uncertainty despite homogeneous flow field uncertainty. Second, it shows a close link between local minima of the OW expectation (eddy centers) and local maxima of its uncertainty. Third, it reveals a practical information barrier: the reduction in uncertainty in diagnostics asymptotically saturates, limiting the benefit of additional observations.</description>

      <title>On the inverse problem of the earthquake source and the three-phase relaxation mode of the source after the formation of a main rupture in it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamentals of the phenomenological theory of aftershocks are presented. The theory contains an original concept of the proper time of the earthquake source, the course of which, generally speaking, differs from the course of world time. Within the framework of the theory, a new method for processing and analyzing earthquakes has been developed. Analysis of the Tohoku earthquake demonstrated the effectiveness of the method. Three phases of relaxation of the source were discovered. In the initial phase, the deactivation coefficient, which characterizes the source as a dynamic system, is equal to zero. At the end of the initial phase, the deactivation coefficient suddenly acquires a positive value, which remains unchanged throughout the main relaxation phase. The transition from the main phase to the recovery phase is accompanied by a jump in the time derivative of the deactivation coefficient. The recovery phase differs from the initial and main phases by chaotic variations in the deactivation coefficient. Keywords: dynamic system, deactivation coefficient, proper time. synchronization, foreshocks, mainshock, aftershocks.</description>

      <title>High-resolution velocity model estimation with neural operator and the time-shift imaging condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting subsurface velocity information from seismic data is mainly an undetermined problem that requires injecting a priori information to constrain the inversion process. Machine learning has offered a platform to do so through the training process, as we formulate our training dataset to inject as much prior knowledge as possible in the trained ML model. Here, we use a neural-operator-based framework for high-resolution seismic velocity model building, which integrates Neural Operators with time-lag reverse time migration imaging. Unlike conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) methods that rely on iterative forward and adjoint-state computations, our approach learns a direct mapping from initial velocity models and extended seismic images to high-resolution velocity estimates through supervised learning. The network architecture enables mesh-independent generalization by learning mappings in infinite-dimensional function spaces, while synthetic velocity models and time-lag reverse time migration (RTM) images provide complementary high-frequency information critical for recovering mid- and high-wavenumber velocity components. Synthetic experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately reconstructs fine-scale structures and complex geologies, including out-of-distribution features such as salt bodies. Applications to real seismic field data acquired offshore Australia further validate the method's robustness and resolution capability. The predicted models show enhanced structural details and improved consistency with well-log data, outperforming traditional multi-scale FWI in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The entire prediction process is completed within seconds, making the proposed approach highly suitable for rapid and scalable velocity model building in practical exploration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Chemical transport by weakly nonlinear internal gravity waves in stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is well-known that internal gravity waves (IGWs) transport chemicals in the radiative zones of stars, there remains substantial uncertainty on the amount of, and physical mechanism behind, this transport. Most previous studies have relied on heuristic theories, or numerical simulations that may be hard to extrapolate to stellar parameters. In this work, we present the first rigorous asymptotic calculation of (passive) chemical transport by IGWs, in the limit of small wave amplitude. We find that the net transport by a coherent packet of waves scales like wave amplitude to the fourth power, and verify these analytic calculations with numerical simulations. Because the transport is equally likely to be positive as negative, the transport by a random superposition of waves is expected to scale as wave amplitude to the eighth power. These results show that closer comparisons between theoretical arguments and numerical calculations are essential for interpreting numerical simulations of chemical transport by IGWs, and making accurate predictions of this process for stellar evolution modeling.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>GlobalTomo: A global dataset for physics-ML seismic wavefield modeling and FWI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18202v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global seismic tomography, taking advantage of seismic waves from natural earthquakes, provides essential insights into the earth's internal dynamics. Advanced Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) techniques, whose aim is to meticulously interpret every detail in seismograms, confront formidable computational demands in forward modeling and adjoint simulations on a global scale. Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) offer a transformative potential for accelerating the computational efficiency of FWI and extending its applicability to larger scales. This work presents the first 3D global synthetic dataset tailored for seismic wavefield modeling and full-waveform tomography, referred to as the GlobalTomo dataset. This dataset is uniquely comprehensive, incorporating explicit wave physics and robust geophysical parameterization at realistic global scales, generated through state-of-the-art forward simulations optimized for 3D global wavefield calculations. Through extensive analysis and the establishment of ML baselines, we illustrate that ML approaches are particularly suitable for global FWI, overcoming its limitations with rapid forward modeling and flexible inversion strategies. This work represents a cross-disciplinary effort to enhance our understanding of the earth's interior through physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow channeling and mass transport with discontinuous porosity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method, which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions efficiently. The space-time method enables straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results indicate that, under certain conditions, the discontinuity of the initial porosity influences the distribution of incompatible trace elements, leading to sharp concentration gradients and large degrees of elemental enrichment. Finally, our results indicate that the enrichment of trace elements depends not only on the channelization of the flow but also on the interaction of fluid-filled channels with layers of different porosity and permeability.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>
