      <title>Belief-Combining Framework for Multi-Trace Reconstruction over Channels with Insertions, Deletions, and Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal reconstruction of a source sequence from multiple noisy traces corrupted by random insertions, deletions, and substitutions typically requires joint processing of all traces, leading to computational complexity that grows exponentially with the number of traces. In this work, we propose an iterative belief-combining procedure that computes symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities by propagating trace-wise inferences via message passing. We prove that, upon convergence, our method achieves the same reconstruction performance as joint maximum a posteriori estimation, while reducing the complexity to quadratic in the number of traces. This performance equivalence is validated using a real-world dataset of clustered short-strand DNA reads.</description>

      <title>How Entanglement Reshapes the Geometry of Quantum Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for quantifying privacy guarantees in quantum information processing. While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Secure Aggregation over Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale decentralized learning frameworks such as federated learning (FL), require both communication efficiency and strong data security, motivating the study of secure aggregation (SA). While information-theoretic SA is well understood in centralized and fully connected networks, its extension to decentralized networks with limited local connectivity remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces \emph{topological secure aggregation} (TSA), which studies one-shot, information-theoretically secure aggregation of neighboring users' inputs over arbitrary network topologies. We develop a unified linear design framework that characterizes TSA achievability through the spectral properties of the communication graph, specifically the kernel of a diagonally modulated adjacency matrix. For several representative classes of $d$-regular graphs including ring, prism and complete topologies, we establish the optimal communication and secret key rate region. In particular, to securely compute one symbol of the neighborhood sum, each user must (i) store at least one key symbol, (ii) broadcast at least one message symbol, and (iii) collectively, all users must hold at least $d$ i.i.d. key symbols. Notably, this total key requirement depends only on the \emph{neighborhood size} $d$, independent of the network size, revealing a fundamental limit of SA in decentralized networks with limited local connectivity.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Empowered Backscatter ISAC: Toward Geometry-Adaptive, Low-Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter-based integrated sensing and communication (B-ISAC) elevates passive tags into information-bearing scatterers, offering an ultra-low-power path toward dual-function wireless systems. However, this promise is fundamentally undermined by a cascaded backscattering link that suffers from severe double fading and is exquisitely sensitive to geometric misalignment. This article tackles this geometric bottleneck by integrating movable antenna systems (MAS) at the transceiver side. MAS provides real-time, controllable spatial degrees of freedom through sub-wavelength antenna repositioning, enabling active reconfiguration of the cascaded channel without modifying passive tags or consuming additional spectrum. We position this solution within a unified ISAC-backscatter communication-B-ISAC evolution, describe the resulting MAS-assisted B-ISAC architecture and operating principles, and demonstrate its system-level gains through comparative analysis and numerical results. Finally, we showcase the potential of this geometry-adaptive paradigm across key IoT application scenarios, pointing toward future motion-aware wireless networks.</description>

      <title>On the Analysis of Platooned Vehicular Networks on Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular platooning refers to coordinated and close movement of vehicular users (VUs) traveling together along a common route segment, offering strategic benefits such as reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and improved traffic flow. {Highways offer a natural setting for platooning due to extended travel distances, yet their potential remains underexplored, particularly in terms of communication and connectivity. Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Antenna Placement for Pinching-Antenna Systems under User Location Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems have attracted much attention recently owing to its capability to maintain reliable line-of-sight (LoS) communication in high-frequency bands. By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Multicycle Codes for Complete Single-Shot Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate multicycle (MM) codes, a new family of quantum error correcting codes that unifies and generalizes bivariate bicycle codes, multivariate bicycle codes, abelian two-block group algebra codes, generalized bicycle codes, trivariate tricycle codes, and n-dimensional toric codes. MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$. Notably, our codes achieve confinement profiles that surpass all known single-shot decodable quantum CSS codes of practical blocksize.</description>

      <title>Advances in Diffusion-Based Generative Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popularized by their strong image generation performance, diffusion and related methods for generative modeling have found widespread success in visual media applications. In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be generated at extremely low bit-rates. This article provides a unifying review of recent diffusion-based methods for generative lossy compression, with a focus on image compression. These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation. We review representative approaches through the lens of rate-distortion-perception theory, highlighting the role of common randomness and connections to inverse problems, and identify open challenges.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Compressors in Distributed Mean Estimation with Limited Communication Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed high dimensional mean estimation is a common aggregation routine used often in distributed optimization methods. Most of these applications call for a communication-constrained setting where vectors, whose mean is to be estimated, have to be compressed before sharing. One could independently encode and decode these to achieve compression, but that overlooks the fact that these vectors are often close to each other. To exploit these similarities, recently Suresh et al., 2022, Jhunjhunwala et al., 2021, Jiang et al, 2023, proposed multiple correlation-aware compression schemes. However, in most cases, the correlations have to be known for these schemes to work. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of graceful degradation of these correlation-aware compression schemes with increasing dissimilarity is limited to only the $\ell_2$-error in the literature. In this paper, we propose four different collaborative compression schemes that agnostically exploit the similarities among vectors in a distributed setting. Our schemes are all simple to implement and computationally efficient, while resulting in big savings in communication. The analysis of our proposed schemes show how the $\ell_2$, $\ell_\infty$ and cosine estimation error varies with the degree of similarity among vectors.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Shuffling Beyond Pure Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shuffling is a powerful way to amplify privacy of a local randomizer in private distributed data analysis, but existing analyses mostly treat the local differential privacy (DP) parameter $\varepsilon_0$ as the only knob and give generic upper bounds that can be loose and do not even characterize how shuffling amplifies privacy for basic mechanisms such as the Gaussian mechanism. We revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop an asymptotic analysis that applies to a broad class of local randomizers under mild regularity assumptions, without requiring pure local DP. Our key finding is that the leading term of the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $\chi$, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this asymptotic analysis to both upper and lower bounds, we obtain a tight band for $\delta_n$ in the shuffled mechanism's $(\varepsilon_n,\delta_n)$-DP guarantee. Moreover, we derive a simple structural necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which the blanket-divergence-based upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight. Finally, we complement the asymptotic theory with an FFT-based algorithm for computing the blanket divergence at finite $n$, which offers rigorously controlled relative error and near-linear running time in $n$, providing a practical numerical analysis for shuffle DP.</description>

      <title>Riddle Quest : The Enigma of Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Boppana's entropy inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent progress on the union-closed sets conjecture, a key lemma has been Boppana's entropy inequality: $h(x^2)\ge\phi xh(x)$, where $\phi=(1+\sqrt5)/2$ and $h(x)=-x\log x-(1-x)\log(1-x)$. In this note, we prove that the generalized inequality $\alpha_kh(x^k)\ge x^{k-1}h(x)$, first conjectured by Yuster, holds for real $k&gt;1$, where $\alpha_k$ is the unique positive solution to $x(1+x)^{k-1}=1$. This implies an analogue of the union-closed sets conjecture for approximate $k$-union closed set systems. We also formalize our proof in Lean 4.</description>

      <title>Preprocessing Uncertain Data into Supersequences for Sorting and Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the preprocessing framework for dealing with uncertain data, one is given a set of regions that one is allowed to preprocess to create some auxiliary structure such that when a realization of these regions is given, consisting of one point per region, this auxiliary structure can be used to reconstruct some desired output structure more efficiently than would have been possible without preprocessing. The framework has been successfully applied to several, mostly geometric, computational problems.
  In this note, we propose using a supersequence of input items as the auxiliary structure, and explore its potential on the problems of sorting and computing the smallest or largest gap in a set of numbers. That is, our uncertainty regions are intervals on the real line, and in the preprocessing phase we output a supersequence of the intervals such that the sorted order / smallest gap / largest gap of any realization is a subsequence of this sequence.
  We argue that supersequences are simpler than specialized auxiliary structures developed in previous work. An advantage of using supersequences as the auxiliary structures is that it allows us to decouple the preprocessing phase from the reconstruction phase in a stronger sense than was possible in previous work, resulting in two separate algorithmic problems for which different solutions may be combined to obtain known and new results. We identify one key open problem which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Design of RIS-aided mMTC+ Networks for Rate Maximization under the Finite Blocklength Regime with Imperfect Channel Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of massive machine-type communications+, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising technology to boost system performance in scenarios with poor channel conditions. Considering single-antenna sensors transmitting short data packets to a multiple-antenna collector node, we introduce and design an RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the system working in the finite blocklength regime. Due to the large number of reflecting elements and their passive nature, channel estimation errors may occur. In this letter, we then propose a robust RIS optimization to combat such a detrimental issue. Based on concave bounds and approximations, the nonconvex WSR problem for the RIS response is addressed via successive convex optimization (SCO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and complexity of the SCO solutions.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao Bound for Arbitrarily Constrained Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation of parameters confined to an arbitrary set. Unlike existing results that rely on equality or inequality constraints, manifold structures, or the nonsingularity of the Fisher information matrix, the derived CRB applies to any constrained set and holds for any estimation bias and any Fisher information matrix. The key geometric object governing the new CRB is the tangent cone to the constraint set, whose span determines how the constraints affect the estimation accuracy. This CRB subsumes, unifies, and generalizes known special cases, offering an intuitive and broadly applicable framework to characterize the minimum mean-square error of constrained estimators.</description>

      <title>Robust Design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Parameter Estimation in MTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to support parameter estimation in machine-type communications (MTC). We focus on a network where single-antenna sensors transmit spatially correlated measurements to a multiple-antenna collector node (CN) via non-orthogonal multiple access. We propose an estimation scheme based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We also integrate successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate communication failures in noisy and interference-prone channels under the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Moreover, recognizing the importance of channel state information (CSI), we explore various methodologies for its acquisition at the CN. We statistically design the RIS configuration and SIC decoding order to minimize estimation error while accounting for channel temporal variations and short packet lengths. To mirror practical systems, we incorporate the detrimental effects of FBL communication and imperfect CSI errors in our analysis. Simulations demonstrate that larger reflecting surfaces lead to smaller MSEs and underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate decoding order for accuracy and ultimate performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Instance Optimal Phase-Only Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) concerns the recovery of sparse signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that sparse signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases by a linearization procedure, which recasts PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applies (quadratically constrained) basis pursuit to obtain $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$. This paper focuses on the instance optimality and robustness of $\mathbf{x}^{\sharp}$. First, we strengthen the nonuniform instance optimality of Jacques and Feuillen (2021) to a uniform one over the entire signal space. We show the existence of some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le Cs^{-1/2}\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ holds for all $\mathbf{x}$ in the unit Euclidean sphere, where $\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ is the $\ell_1$ distance of $\mathbf{x}$ to its closest $s$-sparse signal. This is achieved by showing the new sensing matrices corresponding to all approximately sparse signals simultaneously satisfy RIP. Second, we investigate the estimator's robustness to noise and corruption. We show that dense noise with entries bounded by some small $\tau_0$, appearing either prior or posterior to retaining the phases, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\tau_0)$. This is near-optimal (up to log factors) for any algorithm. On the other hand, adversarial corruption, which changes an arbitrary $\zeta_0$-fraction of the measurements to any phase-only values, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\sqrt{\zeta_0\log(1/\zeta_0)})$. The developments are then combined to yield a robust instance optimal guarantee that resembles the standard one in linear compressed sensing.</description>

      <title>An invariant-theoretic approach to three weight enumerators of self-dual quantum codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of our recent work (Yin Chen and Runxuan Zhang, Shape enumerators of self-dual NRT codes over finite fields. SIAM J. Discrete Math. 38 (2024), no. 4, 2841-2854) in the setting of quantum error-correcting codes. We use algebraic invariant theory to study three weight enumerators of formally self-dual quantum codes over arbitrary finite fields. We derive a quantum analogue of Gleason's theorem, demonstrating that the weight enumerator of a formally self-dual quantum code can be expressed algebraically by two polynomials. We also show that the double weight enumerator of a formally self-dual quantum code can be expressed algebraically by five polynomials. We explicitly compute the complete weight enumerators of some special self-dual quantum codes. Our approach illustrates the potential of employing algebraic invariant theory to compute weight enumerators of self-dual quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Deep Semantic Inference over the Air: An Efficient Task-Oriented Communication System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We evaluate ResNets-based models on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to simulate real-world classification tasks in wireless environments. We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency and Low-Complexity MLSE for Short-Reach Optical Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the high-speed, low-latency, and low-complexity demand for optical interconnects, simplified maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) is proposed in this paper. Simplified MLSE combines computational simplification and reduced state in MLSE. MLSE with a parallel sliding block architecture reduces latency from linear order to logarithmic order. Computational simplification reduces the number of multipliers from exponential order to linear order. Incorporating the reduced state with computational simplification further decreases the number of adders and comparators. The simplified MLSE is evaluated in a 112-Gbit/s PAM4 transmission over 2-km standard single-mode fiber. Experimental results show that the simplified MLSE significantly outperforms the FFE-only case in bit error ratio (BER) performance. Compared with simplified 1-step MLSE, the latency of simplified MLSE is reduced from 34 delay units in linear order to 7 delay units in logarithmic order. The simplified scheme in MLSE reduces the number of variable multipliers from 512 in exponential order to 33 in linear order without BER performance deterioration, while reducing the number of adders and comparators to 37.2% and 8.4%, respectively, with nearly identical BER performance.</description>

      <title>Group Relative Policy Optimization for Robust Blind Interference Alignment with Fluid Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) leverages dynamic reconfigurability to unlock spatial degrees of freedom and reshape wireless channels. Blind interference alignment (BIA) aligns interference through antenna switching. This paper proposes, for the first time, a robust fluid antenna-driven BIA framework for a K-user MISO downlink under imperfect channel state information (CSI). We formulate a robust sum-rate maximization problem through optimizing fluid antenna positions (switching positions). To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we employ group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that eliminates the critic network. This robust design reduces model size and floating point operations (FLOPs) by nearly half compared to proximal policy optimization (PPO) while significantly enhancing performance through group-based exploration that escapes bad local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that GRPO outperforms PPO by 4.17%, and a 100K-step pre-trained PPO by 30.29%. Due to error distribution learning, GRPO exceeds heuristic MaximumGain and RandomGain by 200.78% and 465.38%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Phase Group Categories of Bimodule Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum channel on a von Neuamnn algebra $\mathcal{M}$ preserving a von Neumann subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$, namely an $\mathcal{N}$-$\mathcal{N}$-bimodule unital completely positive map. By introducing the relative irreducibility of a bimodule quantum channel, we show that its eigenvalues with modulus 1 form a finite cyclic group, called its phase group. Moreover, the corresponding eigenspaces are invertible $\mathcal{N}$-$\mathcal{N}$-bimodules, which encode a categorification of the phase group. When $\mathcal{N}\subset \mathcal{M}$ is a finite-index irreducible subfactor of type II$_1$, we prove that any bimodule quantum channel is relatively irreducible for the intermediate subfactor of its fixed points. In addition, we can reformulate and prove these results intrinsically in subfactor planar algebras without referring to the subfactor using the methods of quantum Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Deeply Learned Robust Matrix Completion for Large-scale Low-rank Data Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust matrix completion (RMC) is a widely used machine learning tool that simultaneously tackles two critical issues in low-rank data analysis: missing data entries and extreme outliers. This paper proposes a novel scalable and learnable non-convex approach, coined Learned Robust Matrix Completion (LRMC), for large-scale RMC problems. LRMC enjoys low computational complexity with linear convergence. Motivated by the proposed theorem, the free parameters of LRMC can be effectively learned via deep unfolding to achieve optimum performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a flexible feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network framework that extends deep unfolding from fix-number iterations to infinite iterations. The superior empirical performance of LRMC is verified with extensive experiments against state-of-the-art on synthetic datasets and real applications, including video background subtraction, ultrasound imaging, face modeling, and cloud removal from satellite imagery.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by $\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a $\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound. This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$. We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Shannon Capacity of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact values and new bounds for the Shannon capacity of two families of graphs: the $q$-Kneser graphs and the tadpole graphs. We also construct a countably infinite family of connected graphs whose Shannon capacity is not attained by the independence number of any finite strong power. Building on recent work of Schrijver, we establish sufficient conditions under which the Shannon capacity of a polynomial in graphs, formed via disjoint unions and strong products, equals the corresponding polynomial of the individual capacities, thereby reducing the evaluation of such capacities to that of their components. Finally, we prove an inequality relating the Shannon capacities of the strong product of graphs and their disjoint union, which yields alternative proofs of several known bounds as well as new tightness conditions. In addition to contributing to the computation of the Shannon capacity of graphs, this paper is intended to serve as an accessible entry point to those wishing to work in this area.</description>
