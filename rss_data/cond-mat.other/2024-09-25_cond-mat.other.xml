      <title>Intrinsic Spin Nernst Effect and Chiral Edge Modes in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Insulators: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vs. Kitaev Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermomagnetic Nernst effect and chiral edge states are key signatures of nontrivial topology and emerging Berry curvature in magnonic systems. Implementing atomistic spin simulations, we theoretically demonstrate the emergence of chiral magnon edge states at the boundaries of a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, which are robust against nonlinear magnon interactions. In our simulations, we consider the spin parameters of CrI$_3$ as a prototype of van der Waals magnetic layers. We show that the spin accumulation is reduced in the presence of Kitaev spin interactions compared to systems governed by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This reduction stems from the breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry, which leads to a shorter spin coherence length imposed by the Kitaev interaction. We propose that measuring the angular dependence of the Nernst signal in a magnetic field provides an effective indirect method for identifying the microscopic origin of topological magnons. Our findings hold promising potential for advancing next-generation energy-harvesting Nernst materials and facilitating the integration of topological magnetic materials with spintronic-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Influence of different mutual friction models on two-way coupled quantized vortices and normal fluid in superfluid $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of two mutual friction models on quantized vortices and normal fluid using two-way coupled simulations of superfluid $^4$He. The normal fluid is affected by quantized vortices via mutual friction. A previous study [Y. Tang, et al. Nat. Commun. 14, 2941 (2023)] compared the time evolutions of the vortex ring radius and determined that the self-consistent two-way coupled mutual friction (S2W) model yielded better agreement with the experimental results than the two-way coupled mutual friction (2W) model whose model parameters were determined through experiments with rotating superfluid helium. In this study, we compare the two models in more detail in terms of the quantized vortex ring propagation, reconnection, and thermal counterflow. We show that the S2W model exhibits better results than the 2W model on the microscopic scale near a quantized vortex, such as during quantized vortex ring propagation and reconnection, although the S2W model requires a higher spatial resolution. For complex flows such as a thermal counterflow, the 2W model can be applied even to a low-resolution flow while maintaining the anisotropic normal fluid velocity fluctuations. In contrast, the 2W model predicts lower normal fluid velocity fluctuations than the S2W model. The two models show probability density functions with $- 3$ power-law tails for the normal fluid velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Rest energy effects for non-relativistic Fermi fields in external potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized Levy-Leblond equation (GLL) is used to study the bound state problem for a non-relativistic Fermi field in external potentials. A condition when the rest energy term can be removed from the GLL equation is determined. For external potentials which do not obey the condition, the bound state spectrum is affected non-trivially by the rest energy of the Fermi field. This is demonstrated for a spherical well type potential of finite depth. The existence of bound states in the well, their number and energies all depend on the value of the rest energy.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints on topological invariants and irreducible band representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>
