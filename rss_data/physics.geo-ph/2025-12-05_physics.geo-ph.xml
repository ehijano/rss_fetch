      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of the Fresh-Saltwater Interface from Time-Domain Electromagnetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geophysical methods provide a cost-effective way to characterize the subsurface for hydrogeological projects, but they rely on solving an inverse problem. Traditionally, deterministic approaches are used, which face challenges due to non-uniqueness. Stochastic methods offer uncertainty quantification but demand high computational resources. Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) bypasses full stochastic inversion by approximating the posterior distribution at lower cost. However, as with Monte Carlo techniques, efficiency depends on the number of inversion parameters. We show that incorporating prior knowledge into parameterization reduces unknowns and computational burden. Using time-domain electromagnetic data, we identify fresh - saltwater interfaces in the Flemish coastal aquifer. Conventional blocky or smooth deterministic inversions often misrepresent this transition zone as too sharp or too gradual. To address this, we parameterize the zone with two variables - depth and thickness - assuming a linear transition. This retains the compactness of parametric inversion while allowing sharp or gradual interfaces like voxel-based methods. To assess reliability, we invert these parameters stochastically using BEL with Thresholding (BEL1D-T). Results indicate this approach effectively captures uncertainty for synthetic and field data. The transition zone remains uncertain due to survey design and inherent non-uniqueness, yet our probabilistic method achieves this without the heavy computational cost of traditional stochastic approaches.</description>

      <title>UnwrapDiff: Conditional Diffusion for Robust InSAR Phase Unwrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase unwrapping is a fundamental problem in InSAR data processing, supporting geophysical applications such as deformation monitoring and hazard assessment. Its reliability is limited by noise and decorrelation in radar acquisitions, which makes accurate reconstruction of the deformation signal challenging. We propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based framework for InSAR phase unwrapping, UnwrapDiff, in which the output of the traditional minimum cost flow algorithm (SNAPHU) is incorporated as conditional guidance. To evaluate robustness, we construct a synthetic dataset that incorporates atmospheric effects and diverse noise patterns, representative of realistic InSAR observations. Experiments show that the proposed model leverages the conditional prior while reducing the effect of diverse noise patterns, achieving on average a 10.11\% reduction in NRMSE compared to SNAPHU. It also achieves better reconstruction quality in difficult cases such as dyke intrusions.</description>

      <title>Ab initio superionic-liquid phase diagram of Fe1-xOx under Earth's inner core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superionic state is a phase of matter in which liquid-like ionic mobility coexists with a solid crystalline lattice. Recently identified in Earth's inner core (IC), this state has attracted considerable attention for its unique kinetic behavior and geophysical implications. However, the ab initio phase diagram describing the equilibrium between the superionic phase and the liquid solution under core conditions remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a thermodynamic approach to compute the Gibbs free energy and construct the ab initio superionic-liquid phase diagram for the Fe1-xOx system under IC conditions. We find that oxygen forms superionic states in both hcp and bcc Fe phases, with a pronounced influence on cooperative diffusion of iron in the bcc lattice. The stability fields of these superionic phases are sensitive to oxygen stoichiometry. The presence of superionic states leads to a higher oxygen concentration in the IC than previously estimated. Our work establishes a framework for investigating superionic-liquid equilibria under extreme conditions.</description>
