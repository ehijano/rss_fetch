      <title>Elementary properties of free lattices II: decidability of the universal theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our work on the model theory of free lattices, solving two of the main open problems from our first paper on the subject. Our main result is that the universal (existential) theory of infinite free lattices is decidable. Our second main result is a proof that finitely generated free lattices are positively distinguishable, as for each $n \geq 1$ there is a positive $\exists \forall$-sentence true in $\mathbf{F}_n$ and false in $\mathbf{F}_{n+1}$. Finally, we show that free lattices are first-order rigid in the class of finitely generated projective lattices, and that a projective lattice has the same existential (universal) theory of an infinite free lattice if and only if it has breadth $&gt; 4$ (i.e., a single existential sentence is sufficient).</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Partition Regularity over Algebraic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partition regularity over algebraic structures is a topic in Ramsey theory that has been extensively researched by combinatorialists. Motivated by recent work in this area, we investigate the computability-theoretic and reverse-mathematical aspects of partition regularity over algebraic structures--an area that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored before. This paper focuses on a 1975 theorem by Straus, which has played a significant role in many of the results in this field.</description>

      <title>On the computability of optimal Scott sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a countable mathematical structure, its Scott sentence is a sentence of the infinitary logic $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$ that characterizes it among all countable structures. We can measure the complexity of a structure by the least complexity of a Scott sentence for that structure. It is known that there can be a difference between the least complexity of a Scott sentence and the least complexity of a computable Scott sentence; for example, Alvir, Knight, and McCoy showed that there is a computable structure with a $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence but no computable $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence. It is well known that a structure with a $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence must have a computable $\Pi_4$ Scott sentence. We show that this is best possible: there is a computable structure with a $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence but no computable $\Sigma_4$ Scott sentence. We also show that there is no reasonable characterization of the computable structures with a computable $\Pi_n$ Scott sentence by showing that the index set of such structures is $\Pi^1_1$-$m$-complete.</description>

      <title>From translations to non-collapsing logic combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prawitz suggested expanding a natural deduction system for intuitionistic logic to include rules for classical logic constructors, allowing both intuitionistic and classical elements to coexist without losing their inherent characteristics. Looking at the added rules from the point of view of the Godel-Gentzen translation, led us to propose a general method for the coexistent combination of two logics when a conservative translation exists from one logic (the source) to another (the host). Then we prove that the combined logic is a conservative extension of the original logics, thereby preserving the unique characteristics of each component logic. In this way there is no collapse of one logic into the other in the combination. We also demonstrate that a Gentzen calculus for the combined logic can be induced from a Gentzen calculus for the host logic by considering the translation. This approach applies to semantics as well. We then establish a general sufficient condition for ensuring that the combined logic is both sound and complete. We apply these principles by combining classical and intuitionistic logics capitalizing on the Godel-Gentzen conservative translation, intuitionistic and S4 modal logics relying on the Godel-McKinsey-Tarski conservative translation, and classical and Jaskowski's paraconsistent logics taking into account the existence of a conservative translation.</description>

      <title>A convergence law for continuous logic and continuous structures with finite domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider continuous relational structures with finite domain $[n] := \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and a many valued logic, $CLA$, with values in the unit interval and which uses continuous connectives and continuous aggregation functions. $CLA$ subsumes first-order logic on ``conventional'' finite structures. To each relation symbol $R$ and identity constraint $ic$ on a tuple the length of which matches the arity of $R$ we associate a continuous probability density function $\mu_R^{ic} : [0, 1] \to [0, \infty)$.
  We also consider a probability distribution on the set $\mathbf{W}_n$ of continuous structures with domain $[n]$ which is such that for every relation symbol $R$, identity constraint $ic$, and tuple $\bar{a}$ satisfying $ic$, the distribution of the value of $R(\bar{a})$ is given by $\mu_R^{ic}$, independently of the values for other relation symbols or other tuples.
  In this setting we prove that every formula in $CLA$ is asymptotically equivalent to a formula without any aggregation function. This is used to prove a convergence law for $CLA$ which reads as follows for formulas without free variables: If $\varphi \in CLA$ has no free variable and $I \subseteq [0, 1]$ is an interval, then there is $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ such that, as $n$ tends to infinity, the probability that the value of $\varphi$ is in $I$ tends to $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Goldstern's principle about unions of null sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goldstern showed in his 1993 paper that the union of a real-parametrized, monotone family of Lebesgue measure zero sets has also Lebesgue measure zero provided that the sets are uniformly $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_1$. Our aim is to study to what extent we can drop the $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_1$ assumption. We show Goldstern's principle for the pointclass $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ holds. We show that Goldstern's principle for the pointclass of all subsets is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and show its negation follows from $\mathsf{CH}$. Also we prove that Goldstern's principle for the pointclass of all subsets holds both under $\mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{AD}$ and in Solovay models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the Erd\H{o}s-Dushnik-Miller theorem (A graph with an uncountable set of vertices has either an infinite independent set or an uncountable clique) in set theory without the axiom of choice. We show that there are three inequivalent versions of this theorem and we give some results about the positions of these versions in the deductive hierarchy of weak choice principles.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>

      <title>Translation-like actions by $\mathbb{Z}$, the subgroup membership problem, and Medvedev degrees of effective subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every infinite, locally finite, and connected graph admitsa translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be takento be transitive exactly when the graph has either one or two ends.The actions constructed satisfy $d(v,v\ast 1)\leq3$ for every vertex$v$. This strengthens a theorem by Brandon Seward. We also study the effective computability of translation-like actionson groups and graphs. We prove that every finitely generated infinitegroup with decidable word problem admits a translation-like actionby $\mathbb{Z}$ which is computable, and satisfies an extra condition whichwe call decidable orbit membership problem. As a nontrivial application of our results, we prove that for everyfinitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem, effectivesubshifts attain all $\Pi_{1}^{0}$ Medvedev degrees. This extends a classification proved by Joseph Miller for $\mathbb{Z}^{d},$ $d\geq1$.</description>

      <title>Around first-order rigidity of Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By the work of Sela, for any free group $F$, the Coxeter group $W_ 3 = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \ast \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \ast \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is elementarily equivalent to $W_3 \ast F$, and so Coxeter groups are not closed under elementary equivalence among finitely generated groups. In this paper we show that if we restrict to models which are generated by finitely many torsion elements (finitely torsion-generated), then we can recover striking rigidity results. Our main result is that if $(W, S)$ is a Coxeter system whose irreducible components are either spherical, or affine or (Gromov) hyperbolic, and $G$ is finitely torsion-generated and elementarily equivalent to $W$, then $G$ is itself a Coxeter group. This combines results of the second author et al. from [MPS22, PS23] with the following main hyperbolic result: if $W$ is a Coxeter hyperbolic group and $G$ is $\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent to $W$ and finitely torsion-generated, then $G$ belongs to a finite collection of Coxeter groups (modulo isomorphism). Furthermore, we show that there are two hyperbolic Coxeter groups $W$ and $W'$ which are non-isomorphic but $\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent. We also show that, on other hand, if we restrict to certain specific classes of Coxeter groups then we can recover the strongest possible form of first-order rigidity, which we call first-order torsion-rigidity, namely the Coxeter group $W$ is the only finitely torsion-generated model of its theory. Crucially, we show that this form of rigidity holds for the following classes of Coxeter groups: even hyperbolic Coxeter groups and free products of one-ended or finite hyperbolic Coxeter groups. We conjecture that the same kind of phenomena occur for the whole class of Coxeter groups. In this direction, we prove that if $W$ and $W'$ are even Coxeter groups which are elementarily equivalent, then they are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>
