      <title>Theta-invariants of $\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalences to spherical 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Bott and Cattaneo's $\Theta$-invariant of 3-manifolds applied to $\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalences from 3-manifolds to a fixed spherical 3-manifold. The $\Theta$-invariants are defined by integrals over configuration spaces of two points with local systems and by choosing some invariant tensors. We compute upper bounds of the dimensions of the space spanned by the Bott--Cattaneo $\Theta$-invariants and of that spanned by Garoufalidis and Levine's finite type invariants of type 2. The computation is based on representation theory of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Mirzakhani's frequencies of simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces in large genus and with many cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof of a conjecture proposed by V. Delecroix, E. Goujard, P. Zograf, and A. Zorich, which describes the large genus asymptotic behaviours of the ratio of frequencies of separating over nonseparating simple closed geodesics on a closed hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ with $n$ cusps. We explicitly give the function $f(\frac{n}{g})$ in the conjecture. The moderate behaviour of the frequencies with respect to the growth rate of the number of cusps compared to that of the genus drastically contrasts with the behaviour of other geometric quantities and exhibits the topological nature of the frequencies.</description>

      <title>On Matveev-Piergallini moves for branched spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Matveev-Piergallini (MP) moves on spines of $3$-manifolds are well-known for their correspondence to the Pachner $2$-$3$ moves in dual ideal triangulations. Benedetti and Petronio introduced combinatorial descriptions of closed $3$-manifolds and combed $3$-manifolds by using branched spines and their equivalence relations, which involve MP moves with 16 distinct patterns of branchings. In this paper, we demonstrate that these 16 MP moves on branched spines are derived from a primary MP move, pure sliding moves, and their inverses. Consequently, we obtain simpler combinatorial descriptions for closed $3$-manifolds and combed $3$-manifolds. Furthermore, we extend these results to framed $3$-manifolds and spin $3$-manifolds. These descriptions are advantageous, particularly when constructing and studying quantum invariants of links and $3$-manifolds. In various constructions of quantum invariants using (ideal) triangulations, branching structures naturally arise to facilitate the assignment of non-symmetric algebraic objects to tetrahedra. In these frameworks, the primary MP move precisely corresponds to certain algebraic pentagon relations, such as the pentagon relation of the canonical element of a Heisenberg double, the Biedenharn-Elliott identity for quantum $6j$-symbols, or Schaeffer's identity for the Rogers dilogarithm and its non-commutative analog for Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm in quantum Teichm\"uller theory. We expect our results to contribute to a better understanding of quantum invariants in the context of spines and ideal triangulations.</description>
