      <title>On the Derivation of the Cosmological Gurzadyan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmology, the Gurzadyan's theorem identifies the most general force law consistent with the finding of Newton's first shell theorem -- that a spherical symmetric mass exerts the same gravitational force as a point mass at its center. This theorem has found important applications in cosmological modeling, particularly in the context of MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which has recently gained renewed attention as a potential alternative to dark matter. The derivation by Gurzadyan is written in an extremely concise and dense style, making it difficult to follow. Recent proofs of the theorem based on power-series methods offer valuable perspectives, though they differ from the original derivation, which is based on perturbation analysis. Our note aims to clarify the underlying logic in a pedagogical way -- accessible to advanced high school or undergraduate students -- while preserving conceptual clarity and mathematical elegance of his insight.</description>

      <title>Operating conditions and thermodynamic bounds of dual radiative heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified description of dual radiative heat engines (RHEs), consisting of two facing optoelectronic components (diodes) and capable of generating electrical power from heat. They can operate in three regimes depending on the applied biases, namely in thermoradiative-negative electroluminescent (TRNEL), thermoradiative-photovoltaic (TRPV) or thermophotonic regimes (TPX, consisting of a light-emitting diode and a PV cell). They have access to operating conditions that are unachievable by single RHEs such as thermophotovoltaic systems: at the radiative limit, TRNEL devices can reach the Carnot efficiency for any bandgap, while TPX devices achieve large power outputs by means of electroluminescent enhancement. Expressions of the maximum power output and related efficiency achieved by dual engines are derived analytically, and reveal that the power output of TPX engines is not bounded. A comparison to usual efficiency bounds also highlights the impact of thermalisation losses, and the subsequent interest of spectral filtering to extend the operating region. The influence of nonradiative recombinations is also investigated. This work provides common framework and guidelines for the study of RHEs, which represent a promising solution for reliable and scalable energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>
