      <title>EmpireDB: Data System to Accelerate Computational Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging discipline of Computational Science is concerned with using computers to simulate or solve scientific problems. These problems span the natural, political, and social sciences. The discipline has exploded over the past decade due to the emergence of larger amounts of observational data and large-scale simulations that were previously unavailable or unfeasible. However, there are still significant challenges with managing the large amounts of data and simulations.
  The database management systems community has always been at the forefront of the development of the theory and practice of techniques for formalizing and actualizing systems that access or query large datasets. In this paper, we present EmpireDB, a vision for a data management system to accelerate computational sciences. In addition, we identify challenges and opportunities for the database community to further the fledgling field of computational sciences. Finally, we present preliminary evidence showing that the optimized components in EmpireDB could lead to improvements in performance compared to contemporary implementations.</description>

      <title>Learned Data Compression: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressing integer keys is a fundamental operation among multiple communities, such as database management (DB), information retrieval (IR), and high-performance computing (HPC). Recent advances in \emph{learned indexes} have inspired the development of \emph{learned compressors}, which leverage simple yet compact machine learning (ML) models to compress large-scale sorted keys. The core idea behind learned compressors is to \emph{losslessly} encode sorted keys by approximating them with \emph{error-bounded} ML models (e.g., piecewise linear functions) and using a \emph{residual array} to guarantee accurate key reconstruction.
  While the concept of learned compressors remains in its early stages of exploration, our benchmark results demonstrate that an SIMD-optimized learned compressor can significantly outperform state-of-the-art CPU-based compressors. Drawing on our preliminary experiments, this vision paper explores the potential of learned data compression to enhance critical areas in DBMS and related domains. Furthermore, we outline the key technical challenges that existing systems must address when integrating this emerging methodology.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Consistent Answers on Annotated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embark on a study of the consistent answers of queries over databases annotated with values from a naturally ordered positive semiring. In this setting, the consistent answers of a query are defined as the minimum of the semiring values that the query takes over all repairs of an inconsistent database. The main focus is on self-join free conjunctive queries and key constraints, which is the most extensively studied case of consistent query answering over standard databases. We introduce a variant of first-order logic with a limited form of negation, define suitable semiring semantics, and then establish the main result of the paper: the consistent query answers of a self-join free conjunctive query under key constraints are rewritable in this logic if and only if the attack graph of the query contains no cycles. This result generalizes an analogous result of Koutris and Wijsen for ordinary databases, but also yields new results for a multitude of semirings, including the bag semiring, the tropical semiring, and the fuzzy semiring. We also show that there are self-join free conjunctive queries with a cyclic attack graph whose certain answers under bag semantics have no polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm, unless P = NP.</description>

      <title>Soft and Constrained Hypertree Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypertree decompositions provide a way to evaluate Conjunctive Queries (CQs) in polynomial time, where the exponent of this polynomial is determined by the width of the decomposition. In theory, the goal of efficient CQ evaluation therefore has to be a minimisation of the width. However, in practical settings, it turns out that there are also other properties of a decomposition that influence the performance of query evaluation. It is therefore of interest to restrict the computation of decompositions by constraints and to guide this computation by preferences. To this end, we propose a novel framework based on candidate tree decompositions, which allows us to introduce soft hypertree width (shw). This width measure is a relaxation of hypertree width (hw); it is never greater than hw and, in some cases, shw may actually be lower than hw. ost importantly, shw preserves the tractability of deciding if a given CQ is below some fixed bound, while offering more algorithmic flexibility. In particular, it provides a natural way to incorporate preferences A prototype implementation and preliminary experiments confirm that this novel framework can indeed have a practical impact on query evaluation.</description>

      <title>Hyperparametric Robust and Dynamic Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust influence maximization in dynamic diffusion networks. In line with recent works, we consider the scenario where the network can undergo insertion and removal of nodes and edges, in discrete time steps, and the influence weights are determined by the features of the corresponding nodes and a global hyperparameter. Given this, our goal is to find, at every time step, the seed set maximizing the worst-case influence spread across all possible values of the hyperparameter. We propose an approximate solution using multiplicative weight updates and a greedy algorithm, with provable quality guarantees. Our experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>The Selection Problem in Multi-Query Optimization: a Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.</description>

      <title>NAT-NL2GQL: A Novel Multi-Agent Framework for Translating Natural Language to Graph Query Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized many fields, not only traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, research on applying LLMs to the database field has been booming, and as a typical non-relational database, the use of LLMs in graph database research has naturally gained significant attention. Recent efforts have increasingly focused on leveraging LLMs to translate natural language into graph query language (NL2GQL). Although some progress has been made, these methods have clear limitations, such as their reliance on streamlined processes that often overlook the potential of LLMs to autonomously plan and collaborate with other LLMs in tackling complex NL2GQL challenges. To address this gap, we propose NAT-NL2GQL, a novel multi-agent framework for translating natural language to graph query language. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic agents: the Preprocessor agent, the Generator agent, and the Refiner agent. The Preprocessor agent manages data processing as context, including tasks such as name entity recognition, query rewriting, path linking, and the extraction of query-related schemas. The Generator agent is a fine-tuned LLM trained on NL-GQL data, responsible for generating corresponding GQL statements based on queries and their related schemas. The Refiner agent is tasked with refining the GQL or context using error information obtained from the GQL execution results. Given the scarcity of high-quality open-source NL2GQL datasets based on nGQL syntax, we developed StockGQL, a dataset constructed from a financial market graph database. It is available at: https://github.com/leonyuancode/StockGQL. Experimental results on the StockGQL and SpCQL datasets reveal that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting its potential for advancing NL2GQL research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Healthcare Recommendation Systems with a Multimodal LLMs-based MOE Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of multimodal data, many fields urgently require advanced architectures capable of effectively integrating these diverse data sources to address specific problems. This study proposes a hybrid recommendation model that combines the Mixture of Experts (MOE) framework with large language models to enhance the performance of recommendation systems in the healthcare domain. We built a small dataset for recommending healthy food based on patient descriptions and evaluated the model's performance on several key metrics, including Precision, Recall, NDCG, and MAP@5. The experimental results show that the hybrid model outperforms the baseline models, which use MOE or large language models individually, in terms of both accuracy and personalized recommendation effectiveness. The paper finds image data provided relatively limited improvement in the performance of the personalized recommendation system, particularly in addressing the cold start problem. Then, the issue of reclassification of images also affected the recommendation results, especially when dealing with low-quality images or changes in the appearance of items, leading to suboptimal performance. The findings provide valuable insights into the development of powerful, scalable, and high-performance recommendation systems, advancing the application of personalized recommendation technologies in real-world domains such as healthcare.</description>

      <title>Dung's Argumentation Framework: Unveiling the Expressive Power with Inconsistent Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between inconsistent databases and Dung's abstract argumentation framework has recently drawn growing interest. Specifically, an inconsistent database, involving certain types of integrity constraints such as functional and inclusion dependencies, can be viewed as an argumentation framework in Dung's setting. Nevertheless, no prior work has explored the exact expressive power of Dung's theory of argumentation when compared to inconsistent databases and integrity constraints. In this paper, we close this gap by arguing that an argumentation framework can also be viewed as an inconsistent database. We first establish a connection between subset-repairs for databases and extensions for AFs, considering conflict-free, naive, admissible, and preferred semantics. Further, we define a new family of attribute-based repairs based on the principle of maximal content preservation. The effectiveness of these repairs is then highlighted by connecting them to stable, semi-stable, and stage semantics. Our main contributions include translating an argumentation framework into a database together with integrity constraints. Moreover, this translation can be achieved in polynomial time, which is essential in transferring complexity results between the two formalisms.</description>

      <title>SMARTFEAT: Efficient Feature Construction through Feature-Level Foundation Model Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before applying data analytics or machine learning to a data set, a vital step is usually the construction of an informative set of features from the data. In this paper, we present SMARTFEAT, an efficient automated feature engineering tool to assist data users, even non-experts, in constructing useful features. Leveraging the power of Foundation Models (FMs), our approach enables the creation of new features from the data, based on contextual information and open-world knowledge. Our method incorporates an intelligent operator selector that discerns a subset of operators, effectively avoiding exhaustive combinations of original features, as is typically observed in traditional automated feature engineering tools. Moreover, we address the limitations of performing data tasks through row-level interactions with FMs, which could lead to significant delays and costs due to excessive API calls. We introduce a function generator that facilitates the acquisition of efficient data transformations, such as dataframe built-in methods or lambda functions, ensuring the applicability of SMARTFEAT to generate new features for large datasets.

      <title>Learned Indexes with Distribution Smoothing via Virtual Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research on learned indexes has created a new perspective for indexes as models that map keys to their respective storage locations. These learned indexes are created to approximate the cumulative distribution function of the key set, where using only a single model may have limited accuracy. To overcome this limitation, a typical method is to use multiple models, arranged in a hierarchical manner, where the query performance depends on two aspects: (i) traversal time to find the correct model and (ii) search time to find the key in the selected model. Such a method may cause some key space regions that are difficult to model to be placed at deeper levels in the hierarchy. To address this issue, we propose an alternative method that modifies the key space as opposed to any structural or model modifications. This is achieved through making the key set more learnable (i.e., smoothing the distribution) by inserting virtual points. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm named CSV to integrate our virtual point insertion method into existing learned indexes, reducing both their traversal and search time. We implement CSV on state-of-the-art learned indexes and evaluate them on real-world datasets. Extensive experimental results show significant query performance improvement for the keys in deeper levels of the index structures at a low storage cost.</description>

      <title>Prompt Valuation Based on Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on new tasks without additional training, simply by providing natural language prompts that demonstrate how the task should be performed. Prompt ensemble methods comprehensively harness the knowledge of LLMs while mitigating individual biases and errors and further enhancing performance. However, more prompts do not necessarily lead to better results, and not all prompts are beneficial. A small number of high-quality prompts often outperform many low-quality prompts. Currently, there is a lack of a suitable method for evaluating the impact of prompts on the results. In this paper, we utilize the Shapley value to fairly quantify the contributions of prompts, helping to identify beneficial or detrimental prompts, and potentially guiding prompt valuation in data markets. Through extensive experiments employing various ensemble methods and utility functions on diverse tasks, we validate the effectiveness of using the Shapley value method for prompts as it effectively distinguishes and quantifies the contributions of each prompt.</description>

Abstract: Table understanding (TU) has achieved promising advancements, but it faces the challenges of the scarcity of manually labeled tables and the presence of complex table structures.To address these challenges, we propose HGT, a framework with a heterogeneous graph (HG)-enhanced large language model (LLM) to tackle few-shot TU tasks.It leverages the LLM by aligning the table semantics with the LLM's parametric knowledge through soft prompts and instruction turning and deals with complex tables by a multi-task pre-training scheme involving three novel multi-granularity self-supervised HG pre-training objectives.We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of HGT, showing that it outperforms the SOTA for few-shot complex TU on several benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyTorch Frame, a PyTorch-based framework for deep learning over multi-modal tabular data. PyTorch Frame makes tabular deep learning easy by providing a PyTorch-based data structure to handle complex tabular data, introducing a model abstraction to enable modular implementation of tabular models, and allowing external foundation models to be incorporated to handle complex columns (e.g., LLMs for text columns). We demonstrate the usefulness of PyTorch Frame by implementing diverse tabular models in a modular way, successfully applying these models to complex multi-modal tabular data, and integrating our framework with PyTorch Geometric, a PyTorch library for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), to perform end-to-end learning over relational databases.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Generating Self-Correction Guideline for In-Context Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-correction in text-to-SQL is the process of prompting large language model (LLM) to revise its previously incorrectly generated SQL, and commonly relies on manually crafted self-correction guidelines by human experts that are not only labor-intensive to produce but also limited by the human ability in identifying all potential error patterns in LLM responses. We introduce MAGIC, a novel multi-agent method that automates the creation of the self-correction guideline. MAGIC uses three specialized agents: a manager, a correction, and a feedback agent. These agents collaborate on the failures of an LLM-based method on the training set to iteratively generate and refine a self-correction guideline tailored to LLM mistakes, mirroring human processes but without human involvement. Our extensive experiments show that MAGIC's guideline outperforms expert human's created ones. We empirically find out that the guideline produced by MAGIC enhance the interpretability of the corrections made, providing insights in analyzing the reason behind the failures and successes of LLMs in self-correction. We make all agent interactions publicly available to the research community, to foster further research in this area, offering a synthetic dataset for future explorations into automatic self-correction guideline generation.</description>

      <title>GPTKB: Comprehensively Materializing Factual LLM Knowledge</title>

Abstract: LLMs have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since (Petroni et al., 2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an availability bias (Tversky and Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the discovery of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materializing an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation.
  As a prototype, we employ GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, a large-scale knowledge base (KB) comprising 105 million triples for over 2.9 million entities - achieved at 1% of the cost of previous KB projects. This work marks a milestone in two areas: For LLM research, for the first time, it provides constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLMs' knowledge (or beliefs). For KB construction, it pioneers new pathways for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org.</description>
