      <title>DataMap: A Portable Application for Visualizing High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: The visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data are essential in biomedical research. There is a need for secure, scalable, and reproducible tools to facilitate data exploration and interpretation. Results: We introduce DataMap, a browser-based application for visualization of high-dimensional data using heatmaps, principal component analysis (PCA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). DataMap runs in the web browser, ensuring data privacy while eliminating the need for installation or a server. The application has an intuitive user interface for data transformation, annotation, and generation of reproducible R code. Availability and Implementation: Freely available as a GitHub page https://gexijin.github.io/datamap/. The source code can be found at https://github.com/gexijin/datamap, and can also be installed as an R package. Contact: Xijin.Ge@sdstate.ed</description>

      <title>Hierarchical protein backbone generation with latent and structure diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical protein backbone generative model that separates coarse and fine-grained details. Our approach called LSD consists of two stages: sampling latents which are decoded into a contact map then sampling atomic coordinates conditioned on the contact map. LSD allows new ways to control protein generation towards desirable properties while scaling to large datasets. In particular, the AlphaFold DataBase (AFDB) is appealing due as its diverse structure topologies but suffers from poor designability. We train LSD on AFDB and show latent diffusion guidance towards AlphaFold2 Predicted Alignment Error and long range contacts can explicitly balance designability, diversity, and noveltys in the generated samples. Our results are competitive with structure diffusion models and outperforms prior latent diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Predicting Nanoparticle Effects on Small Biomolecule Functionalities Using the Capability of Scikit-learn and PyTorch: A Case Study on Inhibitors of the DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 3 (CHOP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented study contributes to ongoing research that aims to overcome challenges in predicting the bio-applicability of nanoparticles. The approach explored a variety of combinations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data derived from SMILES notations and small biomolecule features. The resulting datasets were utilised in machine learning (ML) with scikit-learn and deep neural networks (DNN) with PyTorch. To illustrate the methodology, a quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) targeting DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 3 (CHOP) inhibitors was used. Overall, it was hypothesised that the time- and cost-effective ML model presented in the study could predict whether a nanoformulation acts as a CHOP inhibitor. The optimal performance was obtained by the Random Forest Classifier, which was trained with 19,184 samples and tested with 4,000, and achieved 81.1% accuracy, 83.4% precision, 77.7% recall, 80.4% F1-score, 81.1% ROC and 0.821 five-fold cross validation score. Beyond the main study, two approaches to aid CHOP inhibition drug discovery were presented: a list of functional groups ranked in descending order according to their contribution to CHOP inhibition (64% accuracy) and the CID_SID ML model (90.1 % accuracy).</description>

      <title>smFISH_batchRun: A smFISH image processing tool for single-molecule RNA Detection and 3D reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule RNA imaging has been made possible with the recent advances in microscopy methods. However, systematic analysis of these images has been challenging due to the highly variable background noise, even after applying sophisticated computational clearing methods. Here, we describe our custom MATLAB scripts that allow us to detect both nuclear nascent transcripts at the active transcription sites (ATS) and mature cytoplasmic mRNAs with single-molecule precision and reconstruct the tissue in 3D for further analysis. Our codes were initially optimized for the C. elegans germline but were designed to be broadly applicable to other species and tissue types.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive Carotenoid Quantification in Leaves via Raman Spectroscopy: Optimizing Treatment for Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for quantifying challenging carotenoids in leaf tissues, which typically produce less stable signals than fruits, grains, and roots, by applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) modeling to interpret Raman spectroscopy data. The model's performance was assessed across different spectral preprocessing techniques (smoothing, normalization, baseline correction) and through various subsets of relevant Raman shifts. To generate a broad range of carotenoid contents, genetically modified Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with controlled synthesis and more conventional Spinacia oleracea samples under dark and salt stress were utilized, allowing for the evaluation of model robustness and practical applicability. Transition scores for Arabidopsis thaliana reached 77.27-95.45% in all quantifications, while Spinacia oleracea showed 75-83.33% in 3- and 4-level modeling, demonstrating the LDA model's strong potential for effective application. Among the spectral preprocessing, smoothing had the greatest impact on model performance, enhancing results for Arabidopsis thaliana but showing better outcomes without smoothing for Spinacia oleracea. Overall, this study highlights the potential of LDA modeling combined with Raman spectroscopy as a robust and non-destructive tool for metabolite quantification in herbal plants, with promising applications in agricultural monitoring and quality control.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Causal Network Discovery of Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers via Scientific Literature-based Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The causal relationships between biomarkers are essential for disease diagnosis and medical treatment planning. One notable application is Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, where certain biomarkers may influence the presence of others, enabling early detection, precise disease staging, targeted treatments, and improved monitoring of disease progression. However, understanding these causal relationships is complex and requires extensive research. Constructing a comprehensive causal network of biomarkers demands significant effort from human experts, who must analyze a vast number of research papers, and have bias in understanding diseases' biomarkers and their relation. This raises an important question: Can advanced large language models (LLMs), such as those utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), assist in building causal networks of biomarkers for further medical analysis? To explore this, we collected 200 AD-related research papers published over the past 25 years and then integrated scientific literature with RAG to extract AD biomarkers and generate causal relations among them. Given the high-risk nature of the medical diagnosis, we applied uncertainty estimation to assess the reliability of the generated causal edges and examined the faithfulness and scientificness of LLM reasoning using both automatic and human evaluation. We find that RAG enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more accurate causal networks from scientific papers. However, the overall performance of LLMs in identifying causal relations of AD biomarkers is still limited. We hope this study will inspire further foundational research on AI-driven analysis of AD biomarkers causal network discovery.</description>

      <title>Beyond Glucose-Only Assessment: Advancing Nocturnal Hypoglycemia Prediction in Children with Type 1 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dead-in-bed syndrome describes the sudden and unexplained death of young individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) without prior long-term complications. One leading hypothesis attributes this phenomenon to nocturnal hypoglycemia (NH), a dangerous drop in blood glucose during sleep. This study aims to improve NH prediction in children with T1D by leveraging physiological data and machine learning (ML) techniques. We analyze an in-house dataset collected from 16 children with T1D, integrating physiological metrics from wearable sensors. We explore predictive performance through feature engineering, model selection, architectures, and oversampling. To address data limitations, we apply transfer learning from a publicly available adult dataset. Our results achieve an AUROC of 0.75 +- 0.21 on the in-house dataset, further improving to 0.78 +- 0.05 with transfer learning. This research moves beyond glucose-only predictions by incorporating physiological parameters, showcasing the potential of ML to enhance NH detection and improve clinical decision-making for pediatric diabetes management.</description>

      <title>REMEMBER: Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided Modeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning in Zero- and Few-shot Neurodegenerative Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, is central to disease management. Existing deep learning models require large-scale annotated datasets and often function as "black boxes". Additionally, datasets in clinical practice are frequently small or unlabeled, restricting the full potential of deep learning methods. Here, we introduce REMEMBER -- Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided Modeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning -- a new machine learning framework that facilitates zero- and few-shot Alzheimer's diagnosis using brain MRI scans through a reference-based reasoning process. Specifically, REMEMBER first trains a contrastively aligned vision-text model using expert-annotated reference data and extends pseudo-text modalities that encode abnormality types, diagnosis labels, and composite clinical descriptions. Then, at inference time, REMEMBER retrieves similar, human-validated cases from a curated dataset and integrates their contextual information through a dedicated evidence encoding module and attention-based inference head. Such an evidence-guided design enables REMEMBER to imitate real-world clinical decision-making process by grounding predictions in retrieved imaging and textual context. Specifically, REMEMBER outputs diagnostic predictions alongside an interpretable report, including reference images and explanations aligned with clinical workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that REMEMBER achieves robust zero- and few-shot performance and offers a powerful and explainable framework to neuroimaging-based diagnosis in the real world, especially under limited data.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adversarial Neural Network and Explainable AI for Reducing Tissue-of-Origin Signal in Pan-cancer Mortality Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissue-of-origin signals dominate pan-cancer gene expression, often obscuring molecular features linked to patient survival. This hampers the discovery of generalizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns rather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we propose a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) trained on TCGA RNA-seq data to learn representations less biased by tissue and more focused on survival. Identifying tissue-independent genetic profiles is key to revealing core cancer programs. We assess the DANN using: (1) Standard SHAP, based on the original input space and DANN's mortality classifier; (2) A layer-aware strategy applied to hidden activations, including an unsupervised manifold from raw activations and a supervised manifold from mortality-specific SHAP values. Standard SHAP remains confounded by tissue signals due to biases inherent in its computation. The raw activation manifold was dominated by high-magnitude activations, which masked subtle tissue and mortality-related signals. In contrast, the layer-aware SHAP manifold offers improved low-dimensional representations of both tissue and mortality signals, independent of activation strength, enabling subpopulation stratification and pan-cancer identification of survival-associated genes.</description>

      <title>Brain states analysis of EEG predicts multiple sclerosis and mirrors disease duration and burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.</description>
