      <title>Heterogenous Macro-Finance Model: A Mean-field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the full dynamics of capital allocation and wealth distribution of heterogeneous agents in a frictional economy during booms and busts using tools from mean-field games. Two groups in our models, namely the expert and the household, are interconnected within and between their classes through the law of capital processes and are bound by financial constraints. Such a mean-field interaction explains why experts accumulate a lot of capital in the good times and reverse their behavior quickly in the bad times even in the absence of aggregate macro-shocks. When common noises from the market are involved, financial friction amplifies the mean-field effect and leads to capital fire sales by experts. In addition, the implicit interlink between and within heterogeneous groups demonstrates the slow economic recovery and characterizes the deviating and fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) behaviors of households compared to their counterparts. Our model also gives a fairly explicit representation of the equilibrium solution without exploiting complicated numerical approaches.</description>

      <title>A Cholesky decomposition-based asset selection heuristic for sparse tangent portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, including large number of assets in mean-variance portfolios can lead to higher transaction costs and management fees. To address this, one common approach is to select a smaller subset of assets from the larger pool, constructing more efficient portfolios. As a solution, we propose a new asset selection heuristic which generates a pre-defined list of asset candidates using a surrogate formulation and re-optimizes the cardinality-constrained tangent portfolio with these selected assets. This method enables faster optimization and effectively constructs portfolios with fewer assets, as demonstrated by numerical analyses on historical stock returns. Finally, we discuss a quantitative metric that can provide a initial assessment of the performance of the proposed heuristic based on asset covariance.</description>

      <title>The Relative Entropy of Expectation and Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As operators acting on the undetermined final settlement of a derivative security, expectation is linear but price is non-linear. When the market of underlying securities is incomplete, non-linearity emerges from the bid-offer around the mid price that accounts for the residual risks of the optimal funding and hedging strategy. At the extremes, non-linearity also arises from the embedded options on capital that are exercised upon default. In this essay, these convexities are quantified in an entropic risk metric that evaluates the strategic risks, which is realised as a cost with the introduction of bilateral margin. Price is then adjusted for market incompleteness and the risk of default caused by the exhaustion of capital.
  In the complete market theory, price is derived from a martingale condition. In the incomplete market theory presented here, price is instead derived from a log-martingale condition: \begin{equation} p_t=-\frac{1}{\alpha}\log\mathbb{E}_t\exp[-\alpha p_T] \notag \end{equation} for the price $p$ of a funded and hedged derivative security, where the price measure $\mathbb{E}$ has minimum entropy relative to economic expectations, and the parameter $\alpha$ is determined from the risk appetite of the investor. This price principle is easily applied to standard models for market evolution, with applications considered here including model risk analysis, deep hedging and decentralised finance.</description>

      <title>Market Making with Fads, Informed, and Uninformed Traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the solutions to a continuous-time optimal liquidity provision problem in a market populated by informed and uninformed traders. In our model, the asset price exhibits fads -- these are short-term deviations from the fundamental value of the asset. Conditional on the value of the fad, we model how informed traders and uninformed traders arrive in the market. The market maker knows of the two groups of traders but only observes the anonymous order arrivals. We study both, the complete information and the partial information versions of the control problem faced by the market maker. In such frameworks, we characterise the value of information, and we find the price of liquidity as a function of the proportion of informed traders in the market. Lastly, for the partial information setup, we explore how to go beyond the Kalman-Bucy filter to extract information about the fad from the market arrivals.</description>
