      <title>Dynamic nonlinear multicontinuum homogenization of systems with intrinsically evolving microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multicontinuum homogenization approach for nonlinear problems involving dynamically evolving multiscale media. The main idea of the proposed approach is that one of the fine-scale variables defines continua. It allows us to formulate macroscopic variables and derive new macroscopic models for nonlinear problems, where coefficients can depend on fine-scale functions. As an example, we consider a fingering problem and employ the fine-scale concentration field to define continua. We consider both Galerkin and mixed multicontinuum modeling approaches. In the former, the multicontinuum theory is applied to the pressure and concentration fields; in the latter, it is also applied to the velocity field. In both approaches, we provide multicontinuum expansions, formulate cell problems, and derive the corresponding macroscopic models. We present numerical results for model problems of gravity-driven fingering, viscous fingering, and interface flattening driven by high-contrast flow. The results show that the macroscopic models, derived with the proposed approach, can provide an accurate representation of the coarse-scale solutions.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary High Order Low-rank Completely Positive and Trace Preserving (CPTP) Schemes for Lindblad Equations with Time-dependent Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for designing arbitrary high order low-rank schemes for the Lindblad equation with time-dependent Hamiltonians. Our approach is based on nested Picard iterative integrators (NPI) and results in schemes in Kraus form that are completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP). The schemes are amenable to low rank formulations, making them suitable for problems where the matrix rank of the density matrix is small.</description>

      <title>FG-PINNs: A neural network method for solving nonhomogeneous PDEs with high frequency components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the frequency-guided physics-informed neural networks (FG-PINNs), specifically designed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with high-frequency components. The proposed algorithm relies on prior knowledge about high-frequency components obtained from PDEs. It aims to use this prior knowledge to guide the neural network in rapidly approximating the solution's high-frequency components. The FG-PINNs consist of two subnetworks, including a high-frequency subnetwork for capturing high-frequency components and a low-frequency subnetwork for capturing low-frequency components. The key innovation in the high-frequency subnetworks is to embed prior knowledge for high-frequency components into the network structure. For nonhomogeneous PDEs ($f(x)\neq c, c\in R$), we embed the source term as an additional feature into the neural network. The source term typically contains partial or complete frequency information of the target solution, particularly its high-frequency components. This provides prior knowledge about the high-frequency components of the target solution. For homogeneous PDEs, we embed the initial/boundary conditions with high-frequency components into the neural network. Based on spectral bias, we use a fully connected neural network as the low-frequency subnetwork to capture low-frequency components of the target solution. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the FG-PINNs, including the one-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$), the nonlinear wave equations (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$) and the two-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-3})$).</description>

      <title>Discretization, Uniform-in-Time Estimations and Approximation of Invariant Measures for Nonlinear Stochastic Differential Equations with Non-Uniform Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximation of invariant measures for nonlinear ergodic stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is a central problem in scientific computing, with important applications in stochastic sampling, physics, and ecology. We first propose an easily applicable explicit Truncated Euler-Maruyama (TEM) scheme and prove its numerical ergodicity in the $L^p$-Wasserstein distance ($p\geqslant 1$). Furthermore, by combining truncation techniques with the coupling method, we establish a uniform-in-time $1/2$-order convergence rate in moments for the TEM scheme. Additionally, leveraging the exponential ergodicity of both the numerical and exact solutions, we derive a $1/2$-order convergence rate for the invariant measures of the TEM scheme and the exact solution in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance. Finally, two numerical experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Genetic Interacting Particle Method for Reaction-Diffusion-Advection Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a stochastic genetic interacting particle method (SGIP) for reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equations. The method employs operator splitting to approximate the advection-diffusion and reaction processes, treating the former by particle drift-diffusion and the latter by exact or implicit integration of reaction dynamics over bins where particle density is estimated by a histogram. A key innovation is the incorporation of adaptive resampling to close the loop of particle and density field description of solutions, mimicking mutation in genetics. Resampling is also critical for maintaining long-term stability by redistributing particles with the evolving density field. We provide a comprehensive error analysis, and establish rigorous convergence bounds under appropriate regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments from one to three space dimensions demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various reaction types (FKPP, cubic, Arrhenius) and flow configurations (shear, cellular, cat's eye, ABC flows), showing excellent agreement with finite difference method (FDM) while offering computational advantages for complex flow geometries and higher-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Clustering of a Class of Multigrid Preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a common two-level multigrid construction for block-structured linear systems and identifies a simple way to describe how its smoothing and coarse-grid components interact. By examining the method through a collection of small coupling modes, we show that its behavior can be captured by a single scalar quantity for each mode. The main result is an explicit choice of smoothing parameters that makes all modes respond in the same way, causing the nontrivial eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator to collapse to a single value. This gives a clear and self-contained description of the ideal version of the method and provides a concrete target for designing related schemes. Although the exact spectral collapse requires ideal components, we also show that the same construction naturally produces operators that resemble those used in practical discretizations. Examples from finite-difference and discontinuous Galerkin settings illustrate how the ideal parameters can be used in practice.</description>

      <title>DataTransfer: Neural Network-based Interpolation across Unstructured Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network-based interpolation framework for transferring numerical approximations on different unstructured meshes. Traditional projection or interpolation techniques often depend on mesh connectivity, explicit element mappings, or local reconstruction procedures, which can be computationally demanding and sensitive to mesh misalignment. Instead, we formulate the problem as a data-driven regression task that predicts function values at arbitrary target locations from scattered nodal data on the source mesh. By systematically exploring and comparing several neural network architectures, we identify a configuration that balances accuracy and efficiency and that performs reliably across a range of mesh resolutions and topologies. The resulting model enables fast and accurate evaluation without requiring access to mesh connectivity or element-wise information. Numerical experiments on adaptive meshes suggest that the framework is effective for field reconstruction and data transfer tasks. The code used in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Unconditionally Energy-Stable Numerical Scheme for Bose--Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed and analyzed for computing the ground state of Bose--Einstein condensates. A gradient flow approach is developed, incorporating both a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the $L^2$ conservation and a free energy dissipation. An explicit approximation is applied to the chemical potential, combined with an exponential time differencing (ETD) operator to the diffusion part, as well a stabilizing operator, to obtain an intermediate numerical profile. Afterward, an $L^2$ normalization is applied at the next numerical stage. A theoretical analysis reveals a free energy dissipation under a maximum norm bound assumption for the numerical solution, and such a maximum norm bound could be recovered by a careful convergence analysis and error estimate. In the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the first numerical work that preserves the following combined theoretical properties: (1) an explicit computation at each time step, (2) unconditional free energy dissipation, (3) $L^2$ norm conservation at each time step, (4) a theoretical justification of convergence analysis and optimal rate error estimate. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate these theoretical results, demonstrating excellent agreement with established reference solutions.</description>

      <title>Fast boundary integral method for acoustic wave scattering in two-dimensional layered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast boundary integral method accelerated by the fast multipole method (FMM) for acoustic wave scattering governed by the scalar Helmholtz equation in multi-layered two-dimensional media. Multiple scatterers are randomly distributed in the multi-layered medium with some scatterers possibly intersecting layer interfaces. The boundary integral formulation employs a layered-medium Green's function to enforce transmission conditions across interfaces, thus avoiding unknowns on the interfaces and significantly reducing the size of the discretized problem compared to approaches that use a free-space Green's function. To demonstrate the FMM speedup, a low-order Nystr\"{o}m method is used to discretize the boundary integral equation and then the resulting dense linear system is solved by GMRES iterative solver accelerated by an improved layered media FMM and a overlapping domain decomposition preconditioning. In the low frequency regime, the proposed algorithm achieves an $\mathcal O(N)$ complexity. Numerical results validate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the method under complex settings and various incident angles. The proposed framework provides a scalable and efficient solver for acoustic wave scattering in layered media.</description>

      <title>Unconditional optimal-order error estimates of linear relaxation compact difference scheme for the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a linear, decoupled, mass- and energy-conserving numerical scheme for the multi-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) system. The scheme combines the fourth-order compact difference approximation in space with the relaxation technique in a time-staggered mesh framework, solving the primal unknowns and introduced auxiliary relaxation variables sequentially with high efficiency and high-order accuracy. We show the unique solvability and discrete conservation laws of the developed scheme. In particular, for the first time, leveraging an auxiliary error equation system combined with the cut-off technique, optimal-order error estimates in the discrete H1-norm for the primal variables at the time nodes, and in the discrete L2-norm for the auxiliary relaxation variables at the intermediate time nodes, are rigorously proved without any coupling mesh conditions, which contribute to the primary theoretical contribution of this paper for multi-dimensional CNLS system. Numerical experiments demonstrate convincingly the strong performance of the proposed scheme in long-term simulations, maintaining both physical invariants and high-order accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stochastic differential equations in various applications like coupled neuronal oscillators are driven by time-periodic forces. In this paper, we extend several data-driven computational tools from autonomous Fokker-Planck equation to the time-periodic setting. This allows us to efficiently compute the time-periodic invariant probability measure using either grid-base method or artificial neural network solver, and estimate the speed of convergence towards the time-periodic invariant probability measure. We analyze the convergence of our algorithms and test their performances with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Sharpened PCG Iteration Bound for High-Contrast Heterogeneous Scalar Elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new iteration bound for the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is presented that more accurately captures convergence for systems with clustered eigenspectra, where the classical condition number-based bound is too pessimistic. By using the edge eigenvalues of each cluster in the spectral distribution, the bound is shown to be orders of magnitude sharper than the classical bound for certain examples. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a high-contrast elliptic PDE preconditioned with a two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, where the performance of different (algebraic) coarse spaces is successfully distinguished. A key contribution of this work is the observation that, for certain high-contrast problems, simpler coarse spaces can be made competitive in terms of PCG convergence. Conversely, more complex preconditioners are not always required. Finally, it is shown that the bound can be estimated effectively from Ritz values computed during early PCG iterations.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for numerical differentiation using kernels of finite smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide improved error bounds for kernel-based numerical differentiation in terms of growth functions when kernels are of a finite smoothness, such as polyharmonic splines, thin plate splines or Wendland kernels. In contrast to existing literature, the new estimates take into account the H\"older class smoothness of kernel's derivatives, which helps to improve the order of the estimate. In addition, the new estimates apply to certain deficient point sets, relaxing a standard assumption that an approximation with conditionally positive definite kernels must rely on determining sets for polynomials.</description>

      <title>Preserving Extreme Singular Values with One Oblivious Sketch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when a single linear sketch can control the largest and smallest nonzero singular values of every rank-$r$ matrix. Classical oblivious embeddings require $s=\Theta(r/\varepsilon^{2})$ for $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ distortion, but this does not yield constant-factor control of extreme singular values or condition numbers. We formalize a conjecture that $s=O(r\log r)$ suffices for such preservation. On the constructive side, we show that combining a sparse oblivious sketch with a deterministic geometric balancing map produces a sketch whose nonzero singular values collapse to a common scale under bounded condition number and coherence. On the negative side, we prove that any oblivious sketch achieving relative $\varepsilon$-accurate singular values for all rank-$r$ matrices must satisfy $s=\Omega((r+\log(1/\delta))/\varepsilon^{2})$. Numerical experiments on structured matrix families confirm that balancing improves conditioning and accelerates iterative solvers, while coherent or nearly rank-deficient inputs manifest the predicted failure modes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the randomized sketch to solve a variety of problems in scientific computation, we improve both the maximal weighted residual Kaczmarz method and the randomized block average Kaczmarz method using two new randomized sketch techniques. Besides, convergence analyses of the proposed methods are provided. Furthermore, we establish an upper bound for the discrepancy between the numerical solutions obtained via the proposed methods and those derived from the original approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new methods perform better than the existing ones in terms of the running time with the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>An energy cascade finite volume scheme for a mixed 3- and 4-wave kinetic equation arising from the theory of finite-temperature trapped Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on recent developments in numerical schemes designed to capture energy cascades for 3-wave kinetic equations~\cite{das2024numerical, walton2022deep, walton2023numerical, walton2024numerical}, we construct in this work a finite-volume algorithm for a significantly more complex wave kinetic equation whose collision operator incorporates both 3-wave and 4-wave interactions. This model arises in the context of finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensation. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed scheme, and our numerical experiments demonstrate that it successfully captures the energy cascade behavior predicted by the equation.</description>

      <title>Improved $L^2$-error estimates for the wave equation discretized using hybrid nonconforming methods on simplicial meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present improved $L^2$-error estimates on the time-integrated primal variable for the wave equation in its first-order formulation. The space discretization relies on a hybrid nonconforming method, such as the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin, the hybrid high-order or the weak Galerkin methods. We consider both equal-order and mixed-order settings on simplices, and include the lowest-order case with piecewise constant unknowns on the faces and in the cells. Our main result is a superclose, resp., optimal bound on the above error in the equal-, resp., mixed-order case. A key result of independent interest to achieve these estimates are novel approximation estimates for an interpolation operator inspired from the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin literature.</description>

      <title>Variational Principles for the Helmholtz equation: application to Finite Element and Neural Network approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Variational Principles can be associated with the Helmholtz equation subject to impedance (absorbing) boundary conditions. This model has been extensively studied in the literature from both mathematical and computational perspectives. It is classical with wide applications, yet accurate approximation at high wavenumbers remains challenging. We address the question of whether there exist energy functionals with a clear physical interpretation whose stationary points, the zeros of their first variation, correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz problem. Starting from Hamilton's principle for the wave equation, we derive time-harmonic energies. The resulting functionals are generally indefinite. As a next step, we construct strongly coercive augmentations of these indefinite functionals that preserve their physical interpretation. Finally, we show how these variational principles lead to practical numerical methods based on finite element spaces and neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>A Bi-fidelity based asymptotic-preserving neural network for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation and its inverse problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Bi-fidelity Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (BI-APNNs) framework, designed to efficiently solve forward and inverse problems for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation. Our approach builds upon the Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNNs) methodology \cite{APNN-transport}, which employs a micro-macro decomposition to handle the model's multiscale nature. We specifically address a key bottleneck in the original APNNs: the slow convergence of the macroscopic density $\rho$ in the near fluid-dynamic regime, i.e., for small Knudsen numbers $\varepsilon$. The core innovation of BI-APNNs is a novel bi-fidelity decomposition of the macroscopic quantity $\rho$, which accurately approximates the true density at small $\varepsilon$, and can be efficiently pre-trained. A separate and more compact neural network is then tasked with learning only the minor correction term, $\rho_{\text{corr}}$. This strategy not only significantly {\it accelerates} the training convergence but also improves the accuracy of the forward problem solution, particularly in the challenging fluid-dynamic limit. Meanwhile, we demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our new BI-APNNs yields substantially more accurate and robust results for inverse problems compared to the standard APNNs. Validated on both the semiconductor Boltzmann and the Boltzmann-Poisson systems, our work shows that the bi-fidelity formulation is a powerful enhancement for tackling multiscale kinetic equations, especially when dealing with inverse problems constrained by partial observation data.</description>

      <title>Discrete $H$-theorem for a finite volume discretization of a nonlinear kinetic system: application to hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the long-time behavior of a finite-volume discretization for a nonlinear kinetic reaction model involving two interacting species. Building upon the seminal work of [Favre, Pirner, Schmeiser, ARMA, 2023], we extend the discrete exponential convergence to equilibrium result established in [Bessemoulin-Chatard, Laidin, Rey, IMAJNA, 2025], which was obtained in a perturbative framework using weighted $L^2$ estimates. The analysis applies to a broader class of exponentially decaying initial data, without requiring proximity to equilibrium, by exploiting the properties of the Boltzmann entropy. The proof relies on the propagation of the initial $L^\infty$ bounds, derived from monotonicity properties of the scheme, allowing controlled linearizations within the nonlinear entropy estimates. Moreover, we show that the time-discrete dissipation inherent to the numerical scheme plays a crucial stabilizing role, providing control over the nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>Some error estimates for semidiscrete finite element approximations of stable solutions to mean field game systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a priori error estimates for semidiscrete finite element approximations of stable solutions to time-dependent mean field game systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Expressing solutions to the MFG system as zeros of a nonlinear abstract mapping, we show that the stability of solutions is equivalent to the invertibility of its differential. This characterization allows us to apply the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart approximation theorem in combination with discrete L p maximal regularity estimates to prove existence of solutions to the semidiscrete MFG system and to derive the error estimate. Finally, for solutions satisfying sufficient regularity assumptions, we establish quasi-optimal error bounds, meaning the approximation achieves the best possible convergence rate when the solution has sufficient smoothness.</description>

      <title>A space-time hybrid parareal method for kinetic equations in the diffusive scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multiscale numerical approach that combines parallel-in-time computation with hybrid domain adaptation for linear collisional kinetic equations in the diffusive regime. The method addresses the computational challenges of kinetic simulations by integrating two complementary strategies: a parareal temporal parallelization method and a dynamic spatial domain adaptation based on perturbative analysis. The parallel in time approach employs a coarse fluid solver for efficient temporal propagation coupled with a fine, spatially-hybridized, kinetic solver for accurate resolution. Domain adaptation is governed by two criteria: one measuring the deviation from local velocity equilibrium, and another based on macroscopic quantities available throughout the computational domain. An asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition framework handles the stiffness of the original problem. This fully hybrid methodology significantly reduces computational costs compared to full kinetic approaches by exploiting the lower dimensionality of asymptotic fluid models while maintaining accuracy through selective kinetic resolution. The method demonstrates substantial speedup capabilities and efficiency gains across various kinetic regimes.</description>

      <title>Fault Oblivious Eigenvalue Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvalue problems serve as fundamental substrates for applications in large-scale scientific simulations and machine learning, often requiring computation on massively parallel platforms. As these platforms scale to hundreds of thousands of cores, hardware failures become a significant challenge to reliability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel fault-tolerant eigenvalue solver based on erasure-coded computations -- a technique that enhances resilience by augmenting the system with redundant data a priori. This transformation reformulates the original eigenvalue problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem, enabling fault-oblivious computation while preserving numerical stability and convergence properties. We formulate the augmentation scheme, establish the necessary conditions for the encoded blocks, and prove the relationship between the original and transformed problems. We implement an erasure-coded TraceMin eigensolver and demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting eigenvalues in the presence of faults. Our experimental results show that the proposed solver incurs minimal computational overhead, maintains robust convergence, and scales efficiently with the number of faults, making it a practical solution for resilient eigenvalue computations in large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PINN Accuracy for the RLW Equation: Adaptive and Conservative Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard physics-informed neural network implementations have produced large error rates when using these models to solve the regularized long wave (RLW) equation. Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems.</description>

      <title>Conflict-Free Flight Scheduling Using Strategic Demand Capacity Balancing for Urban Air Mobility Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conflict-free multi- agent flight scheduling that ensures robust separation in con- strained airspace for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations application. First, we introduce Pairwise Conflict Avoidance (PCA) based on delayed departures, leveraging kinematic principles to maintain safe distances. Next, we expand PCA to multi-agent scenarios, formulating an optimization approach that systematically determines departure times under increasing traffic densities. Performance metrics, such as average delay, assess the effectiveness of our solution. Through numerical simulations across diverse multi-agent environments and real- world UAM use cases, our method demonstrates a significant reduction in total delay while ensuring collision-free operations. This approach provides a scalable framework for emerging urban air mobility systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely used as universal approximators for functions with inherent physical structures, including permutation symmetry. In this paper, we construct symmetric deep neural networks to approximate symmetric Korobov functions and prove that both the convergence rate and the constant prefactor scale at most polynomially with respect to the ambient dimension. This represents a substantial improvement over prior approximation guarantees that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Building on these approximation bounds, we further derive a generalization-error rate for learning symmetric Korobov functions whose leading factors likewise avoid the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>A Modal One-Way Navier-Stokes Approach to Modelling Non-Modal Boundary Layer Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to solve the modal form of the linearised one-way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations for investigating disturbance development in developing subsonic and supersonic boundary layers. The modal framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over the conventional non-modal OWNS framework. Notably, we demonstrate that modal OWNS (M-OWNS) retains the capability to capture non-modal disturbance development. Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability. Crucially, we find the algorithm to be more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS, whilst recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the numerical solution of the cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with periodic boundary conditions, a pseudospectral method in space combined with a filtered Lie splitting scheme in time is considered. This scheme is shown to converge even for initial data with very low regularity. In particular, for data in $H^s(\mathbb T^2)$, where $s&gt;0$, convergence of order $\mathcal O(\tau^{s/2}+N^{-s})$ is proved in $L^2$. Here $\tau$ denotes the time step size and $N$ the number of Fourier modes considered. The proof of this result is carried out in an abstract framework of discrete Bourgain spaces, the final convergence result, however, is given in $L^2$. The stated convergence behavior is illustrated by several numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze a structure-preserving method for the approximation of solutions to nonlinear cross-diffusion systems, which combines a Local Discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization with the backward Euler time-stepping scheme. The proposed method makes use of the underlying entropy structure of the system, expressing the main unknown in terms of the entropy variable by means of a nonlinear transformation. Such a transformation allows for imposing the physical positivity or boundedness constraints on the approximate solution in a strong sense. A key advantage of our scheme is that nonlinearities do not appear explicitly within differential operators or interface terms in the scheme, which significantly improves its efficiency and eases its implementation. We prove the existence of discrete solutions and their asymptotic convergence to a weak solution to the continuous problem. Numerical results for some one- and two-dimensional problems illustrate the accuracy and entropy stability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Using Linearized Optimal Transport to Predict the Evolution of Stochastic Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an Euler-type method to predict the evolution of a time-dependent probability measure without explicitly learning an operator that governs its evolution. We use linearized optimal transport theory to prove that the measure-valued analog of Euler's method is first-order accurate when the measure evolves ``smoothly.'' In applications of interest, however, the measure is an empirical distribution of a system of stochastic particles whose behavior is only accessible through an agent-based micro-scale simulation. In such cases, this empirical measure does not evolve smoothly because the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales. However, we can still perform our Euler-type method, and when the particles' collective distribution approximates a measure that \emph{does} evolve smoothly, we observe that the algorithm still accurately predicts this collective behavior over relatively large Euler steps, thus reducing the number of micro-scale steps required to step forward in time. In this way, our algorithm provides a ``macro-scale timestepper'' that requires less micro-scale data to still maintain accuracy, which we demonstrate with three illustrative examples: a biological agent-based model, a model of a PDE, and a model of Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Inexact Abedin-Kitagawa Iteration Method for Monge-Amp\`ere Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an inexact Aleksandrov-solution-based iteration method, formulated by adapting the convergent Rayleigh inverse iterative scheme introduced by Abedin and Kitagawa, to solve real Monge-Amp{\`e}re eigenvalue (MAE) problems. The central feature of the proposed approach is the introduction of a flexible error tolerance criterion for computing inexact Aleksandrov solutions to the required subproblems. This allows the inner iteration to be solved approximately without compromising the global convergence properties of the overall scheme, as we established under a ${\cal C}^{2,\alpha}$ boundary condition, and has the potential of achieving reduced computational cost compared to the original algorithm. In practice, for both two- and three-dimensional problems, by leveraging the flexibility of the inexact iterative formulation in conjunction with a fixed-point approach for solving the subproblems, the proposed method performs several times faster than its original version of Abedin and Kitagawa, across all tested problem instances in the numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to the case of Minkowski space, as we will show. Instead, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The first method is direct least squares optimization through a parametrization of $SO(3,1)_+$ in terms of the familiar boost and rotation vectors. The second method takes a detour through the Lorentz algebra; in addition to being conceptually simple and possessing a computational advantage over the first method, it can easily be generalized to the alignment of vector representations in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Tropical solution of discrete best approximation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider discrete best approximation problems in the setting of tropical algebra, which is concerned with the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of input--output pairs of an unknown function defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an approximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator and denominator. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the approximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial in the polynomials to fit the rational function to the data in the sense of a tropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into an approximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides, where one side corresponds to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the denominator. Each side involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown exponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients. We propose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by alternately fixing one side of the equation to an already-found result and leaving the other side intact. Each equation obtained is approximated with respect to the vector of coefficients, which yields this vector and approximation error, both parameterized by exponents. The exponents are found by minimizing the error with an optimization procedure based on an agglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate, we present results for an approximation problem in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with addition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which corresponds to an ordinary problem of piecewise linear approximation of real functions. As our numerical experience shows, the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and provides a reasonably accurate solution to the problems considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving entropy-regularized stochastic control problems. The method iteratively alternates between soft policy evaluation and improvement using automatic differentiation and neural approximation, without relying on spatial discretization. We present a detailed $L^2$ error analysis that decomposes the total approximation error into three sources: iteration error, policy network error, and PDE residual error. The proposed algorithm is validated with a range of challenging control tasks, including high-dimensional linear-quadratic regulation in 5D and 10D, as well as nonlinear systems such as pendulum and cartpole problems. Numerical results confirm the scalability, accuracy, and robustness of our approach across both linear and nonlinear benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.</description>

      <title>Admissible and attainable convergence behavior with stagnation mirroring in restarted (block) GMRES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we describe how to construct matrices and block right-hand sides the exhibit a specified restarted block \gmres convergence pattern, such that the eigenvalues and Ritz values at each iteration can be chosen independent of the specified convergence behavior. This work is a generalization of the work in [Meurant and Tebbens, Num. Alg. 2019] in which the authors do the same for restarted non-block \gmres. We use the same tools as were used in [Kub\'inov\'a and Soodhalter, SIMAX 2020], namely to analyze block \gmres as an iteration over a right vector space with scalars from the $^\ast$-algebra of matrices. To facilitate our work, we also extend the work of Meurant and Tebbens and offer alternative proofs of some of their results, that can be more easily generalized to the block setting.</description>

      <title>The B-spline-Heaviside collocation method for solving Cauchy singular integral equations with piecewise Holder continuous coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a numerical method for approximating the solution of a Cauchy singular integral equation defined on a closed, smooth contour in the complex plane. The coefficients and the right-hand side of the equation are piecewise H\"{o}lder continuous functions that may exhibit a finite number of jump discontinuities and are given numerically at a finite set of points on the contour. We introduce an efficient approximation scheme for piecewise H\"{o}lder continuous functions based on linear combinations of B-spline basis functions and Heaviside step functions, which serves as the foundation for the proposed collocation algorithm. We establish the convergence of the resulting sequence of approximations to the exact solution in the norm of piecewise H\"{o}lder spaces and derive explicit estimates for the convergence rate of the method.</description>

      <title>Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling: Exploitative Sequences to Accelerate High-Dimensional Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality presents a pervasive challenge in optimization problems, with exponential expansion of the search space rapidly causing traditional algorithms to become inefficient or infeasible. An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.
  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.
  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p &lt; 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of HDS as a robust alternative to QMC sampling for high-dimensional optimization.</description>

      <title>New perturbation bounds for low rank approximation of matrices via contour analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $\sigma_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading to the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. In this paper, we develop a novel method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements, compared to classical approaches in the literature (using Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem or Davis-Kahan theorem), in many settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications.</description>

Abstract: We study the hyperbolic approximation of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation proposed recently by Gavrilyuk and Shyue (2022). We develop asymptotic-preserving numerical methods using implicit-explicit (additive) Runge-Kutta methods that are implicit in the stiff linear part. The new discretization of the hyperbolization conserves important invariants converging to invariants of the BBM equation. We use the entropy relaxation approach to make the fully discrete schemes energy-preserving. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these discretizations.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$-error rate for randomized quasi-Monte Carlo self-normalized importance sampling of unbounded integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) is a fundamental tool in Bayesian inference when the posterior distribution involves an unknown normalizing constant. Although $L_1$-error (bias) and $L_2$-error (root mean square error) estimates of SNIS are well established for bounded integrands, results for unbounded integrands remain limited, especially under randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. In this work, we derive $L_p$-error rate $(p\ge1)$ for RQMC-based SNIS (RQMC-SNIS) estimators with unbounded integrands on unbounded domains. A key step in our analysis is to first establish the $L_p$-error rate for plain RQMC integration. Our results allow for a broader class of transport maps used to generate samples from RQMC points. Under mild function boundary growth conditions, we further establish \(L_p\)-error rate of order \(\mathcal{O}(N^{-\beta + \epsilon})\) for RQMC-SNIS estimators, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is arbitrarily small, $N$ is the sample size, and \(\beta \in (0,1]\) depends on the boundary growth rate of the resulting integrand. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

Abstract: We study the strong approximation of the solutions to singular stochastic kinetic equations (also referred to as second-order SDEs) driven by $\alpha$-stable processes, using an Euler-type scheme inspired by [11]. For these equations, the stability index $\alpha$ lies in the range $(1,2)$, and the drift term exhibits anisotropic $\beta$-H\"older continuity with $\beta &gt;1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}$. We establish a convergence rate of $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha(1+\alpha)} \wedge \frac{1}{2})$, which aligns with the results in [4] concerning first-order SDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimal Subspace Embeddings: Resolving Nelson-Nguyen Conjecture Up to Sub-Polylogarithmic Factors</title>

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].</description>

      <title>Why Cannot Neural Networks Master Extrapolation? Insights from Physical Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Can Linear Probes Measure LLM Uncertainty?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) represents a key aspect for reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated decision-making and beyond. Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice structure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline given by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved performance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear regression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear models, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous one. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the global uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of distributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme. Numerical experiments on various LLMs show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
