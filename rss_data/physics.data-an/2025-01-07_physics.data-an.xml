      <title>The parenthood effect in urban mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modelling of human mobility is vital for the understanding of the complexity of urban dynamics and guiding effective interventions to improve quality of life. Traditional modelling approaches focus on `average citizens,' which overlook the multitude of experiences from distinct sociodemographic groups. Recent studies have unveiled significant variations in mobility patterns related to gender and socioeconomic status, yet the impact of parenthood remains under-explored. Parenthood brings profound changes to daily routines, influenced by factors such as increased caregiving responsibilities, altered work-life balance, and the need for family-friendly environments. Parents often prioritise considerations such as cost of living, social wellbeing, environmental quality, and safety. Quantifying how `friendly' a city is becomes more and more important for parents, especially in the context of rising remote work opportunities which, in turn, reverberate on the choices on where to settle. This work investigates whether these considerations lead to distinct mobility patterns between parents and non-parents, also accounting for the impact of partnership. Using extensive census data across American cities, we analyse how parenthood and partnership reshape their urban experiences. Our findings indicate that cities can indeed be classified by their level of friendliness towards parents and partners. For example, Dallas and Nashville can be more suited for single individuals, New York and Chicago can be more accommodating to parents, while Washington and Baltimore favour married people. These insights contribute to the growing body of research advocating for more nuanced and equitable urban planning. By recognising the diverse needs of different demographic groups, particularly parents, our study underscores the importance of tailored urban design strategies over universal solutions.</description>

      <title>A lightweight analysis farm for fundamental physics experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific collaborations require a strong computing infrastructure to successfully process and analyze data. While large-scale collaborations have access to resources such as Analysis Facilities, small-scale collaborations often lack the resources to establish and maintain such an infrastructure and instead operate with fragmented analysis environments, resulting in inefficiencies, hindering reproducibility and thus creating additional challenges for the collaboration that are not related to the experiment itself. We present a scalable, lightweight and maintainable Analysis Facility developed for the DARWIN collaboration as an example study case. Grid computing and storage resources are integrated into the facility, allowing for distributed computing and a common entry point for storage. The authentication and authorization infrastructure for all services is token-based, using an Indigo IAM instance. We discuss the architecture of the facility, its provided services, the user experience, and how it can serve as a sustainable blueprint for small-scale collaborations.</description>

      <title>Segment Anything Model for Zero-shot Single Particle Tracking in Liquid Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) offers an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution, making it a promising tool for single particle tracking at the nanoscale. However, the absence of a standardized framework for identifying and tracking nanoparticles in noisy LPTEM videos has impeded progress in the field to develop this technique as a single particle tracking tool. To address this, we leveraged Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), released by Meta, which is a foundation model developed for segmenting videos and images. Here, we demonstrate that SAM 2 can successfully segment LPTEM videos in a zero-shot manner and without requiring fine-tuning. Building on this capability, we introduce SAM4EM, a comprehensive framework that integrates promptable video segmentation with particle tracking and statistical analysis, providing an end-to-end LPTEM analysis framework for single particle tracking. SAM4EM achieves nearly 50-fold higher accuracy in segmenting and analyzing LPTEM videos compared to state-of-the-art methods, paving the way for broader applications of LPTEM in nanoscale imaging.</description>
