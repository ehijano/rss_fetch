      <title>Two decades of optical variability of Small Magellanic Cloud high-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the long-term optical/IR behavior of 111 high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud based on data from the OGLE collaboration. Most systems exhibit variability on a range of time scales. This variability regulates the mass transfer to the compact object, while the compact object can, in turn, affect the donor star's behavior. To better understand this complex interaction and the resulting X-ray properties in these systems, we define a new taxonomy for the observed super-orbital variability. This taxonomy connects to the color changes, orbital periods, and X-ray behavior of the sources. In most cases, these properties can be explained by differences between the flux of the disk around the Be star and the flux from the star itself. We also refine and present new potential orbital periods and sub-orbital variability in the sources.</description>

      <title>Implications of Magnetic Flux-Disk Mass Correlation in Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers for GRB sub-populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform numerical relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers with a fixed mass ratio of $q = 3$, varying the BH spin to produce a wide range of post-merger accretion disk masses. Our high-order numerical scheme, fine resolution, and Large Eddy Simulation techniques enable us to achieve likely the most resolved BH-NS merger simulations to date, capturing the post-merger magnetic field amplification driven by turbulent dynamo processes. Following tidal disruption and during disk formation, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the spiral arm drives a turbulent state in which the magnetic field, initialized to a realistic average value of $10^{11}\, \rm{G}$, grows to an average of approximately $10^{14}\, \rm{G}$ in the first $\approx 20\, \mathrm{ms}$ post-merger. Notably, the dimensionless magnetic flux on the BH, $ \phi $, evolves similarly across nearly two orders of magnitude in disk mass. This similarity, along with estimates from longer numerical simulations of the decay of the mass accretion rate, suggests a universal timescale at which the dimensionless flux saturates at a magnetically arrested state (MAD) such that $ \phi \approx 50 $ at $t_{\rm MAD} \gtrsim 10\,{\rm s}$. The unified framework of Gottlieb et al. (2023) established that the MAD timescale sets the duration of the resulting compact binary gamma-ray burst (cbGRB), implying that all BH-NS mergers contribute to the recently detected new class of long-duration cbGRBs.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Radiation Transport Simulations of Infrared Echoes from Dust-Shrouded Luminous Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of stellar explosions, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption events (TDE), and fast blue optical transients (FBOT), can occur in dusty environments initially opaque to the transient's optical/UV light, becoming visible only once the dust is destroyed by the transient's rising luminosity. We present axisymmetric time-dependent radiation transport simulations of dust-shrouded transients with \texttt{Athena++} and tabulated gray opacities, which predict the light-curves of the dust-reprocessed infrared (IR) radiation. The luminosity and timescale of the IR light-curve depends on whether the transient rises rapidly or slowly compared to the light crossing-time of the photosphere, $t_{\rm lc}$. For slow-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \gg t_{\rm lc}$) such as SNe, the reprocessed IR radiation diffuses outwards through the dust shell faster than the sublimation front expands; the IR light-curve therefore begins rising prior to the escape of UV/optical light, but peaks on a timescale $\sim t_{\rm rise}$ shorter than the transient duration. By contrast, for fast-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \ll t_{\rm lc}$) such as FBOTs and some TDEs, the finite light-travel time results in the reprocessed radiation arriving as an ``echo'' lasting much longer than the transient itself (despite the dust photosphere having already being destroyed by peak light). We explore the effects of the system geometry by considering a torus-shaped distribution of dust. The IR light-curves seen by observers in the equatorial plane of the torus resemble those for a spherical dust shell, while polar observers see faster-rising, brighter and shorter-lived emission. We successfully model the IR excess seen in AT2018cow as a dust echo, supporting the presence of an opaque dusty medium surrounding FBOTs prior to explosion.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal Investigation of Quasi-periodic Oscillations From Black Hole X-ray Binary 4U 1630-472 Using $\textit{NICER}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectro-temporal characteristics of the X-ray variabilities from black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472 during its three outbursts (2018, 2020, and 2021) as observed by $\textit{NICER}$. We detected 27 Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs), out of which 25 were observed during the 2021 outburst. In this study, we specifically focus on the relationship between spectral and timing parameters and the frequency of type-C QPOs in the 2021 outburst of the black hole binary 4U 1630-472 during its rising phase. We found strong correlations between the photon index of the non-thermal emission and the QPO frequency. We also observed a critical frequency at $\sim$ 2.31 Hz, above which the behavior of the Q-factor of the QPO changed significantly with the QPO frequency. We further identified two events characterized by a surge in the total flux, corresponding to the disappearance of type-C QPOs. Although the first event appeared like an X-ray flare, during the second event, the source reached a state with a total flux higher than 10$^{-8}$ erg/cm$^{2}$/s and exhibited a different type of QPO with lower frequencies and weaker amplitudes. We compare our results with the previously reported QPO characteristics for black hole outbursts and discuss the various models that could interpret the critical frequency and potentially explain the origin and evolution of these type-C QPOs.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used ("classic") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as "special trajectories." Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.</description>

      <title>Systematic opacity calculations for kilonovae -- II. Improved atomic data for singly ionized lanthanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanides play most important roles in the opacities for kilonova, ultraviolet-optical-infrared emission from neutron star mergers. Although several efforts have been made to construct atomic data, the accuracy in the opacity is not fully assessed and understood. In this paper, we perform atomic calculations for singly ionized lanthanides with improved strategies, aiming at understanding the physics of the lanthanide opacities in kilonova ejecta and necessary accuracy in atomic data. Our results show systematically lower energy level distributions as compared with our previous study (Paper I). As a result, the opacities evaluated with our new results are higher by a factor of up to 3 - 10, depending on the element and wavelength range. For a lanthanide-rich element mixture, our results give a higher opacity than that in Paper I by a factor of about 1.5. We also present opacities by using the results of ab-initio atomic calculations by using Grasp2K code. In general, our new opacities show good agreements with those with ab-initio calculations. We identify that structure of the lanthanide opacities are controlled by transition arrays among several configurations, for which derivation of accurate energy level distribution is important to obtain reliable opacities.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional linear analysis and numerical simulations of Alfven waves in a force-free magnetosphere around a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform one-dimensional linear analysis and numerical simulations of the propagation of Alfven waves in a force-free magnetosphere along magnetic field lines around a spinning black hole. We use the results to investigate the dynamic process of wave propagation and energy transport for Alfven waves. As in a previous study using the Banados--Teitelboim--Zanelli spacetime (Koide et al. 2022), the Alfven wave induces a fast magnetosonic wave in the case of a spinning black hole. Energy conservation is confirmed when this additional induced magnetosonic wave is considered. We also observe the reflection of the inwardly propagating Alfven wave around the static limit, which is prohibited in theory when using the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>Modelling the energy dependent X-ray variability of Mrk 335</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique which predicts the energy dependent fractional r.m.s for linear correlated variations of a pair of spectral parameters and apply it to an XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 335. The broadband X-ray spectrum can be interpreted as a patchy absorber partially covering the primary emission, a warm and hot coronal emission or a relativistically blurred reflection along with the primary emission. The fractional r.m.s has a non-monotonic behavior with energy for segments of lengths 3 and 6 ksecs. For each spectral model, we consider every pair of spectral parameters and fit the predicted r.m.s with the observed ones, to get the pair which provides the best fit. We find that a variation in at least two parameters is required for all spectral interpretations. For both time segments, variations in the covering fraction of the absorber and the primary power law index gives the best result for the partial covering model, while a variation in the normalization and spectral index of the warm component gives the best fit in the two corona interpretation. For the reflection model, the best fit parameters are different for the two time segment lengths, and the results suggests that more than two parameters are required to explain the data. This, combined with the extreme values of emissivity index and reflection fraction parameters obtained from the spectral analysis, indicates that the blurred reflection model might not be a suitable explanation for the Mrk 335 spectrum. We discuss the results as well as the potential of the technique to be applied to other data sets of different AGN.</description>

      <title>Detection of Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Globular Clusters: Revealing the Brownian Motion with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) formed by stellar-mass compact objects orbiting intermediate-mass black holes will be detected by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories like TianQin, LISA, and AION. We study a set of 100 IMRI systems in globular clusters obtained from MOCCA simulations to study their detectability. Furthermore, we model the Brownian motion of the IMRIs induced by weak interactions with the surrounding field of stars and include its effect on the GW's phase through Doppler and aberrational phase shift. We find that a small fraction of IMRIs ($&lt;10\,\%$) will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) high enough to be detected by TianQin, LISA, and AION. However, for all sources detected the SNR is high enough to discern the Brownian motion of the IMRI. More precisely, we find that the match between the signal containing the effect of the Brownian motion and a waveform model without this effect is in most cases low ($&lt;0.5$). These results highlight the importance of including the interaction of IMRIs with the surrounding field of stars to obtain proper detection but also show the possibility of studying the environment of the source using GWs.</description>

      <title>GRB 221009A and the Apparently Most Energetic Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are often referred to as the most luminous explosions in the Universe, due to their short and highly luminous prompt emission. This apparent luminosity, however, does not reflect the true energy budget of the prompt emission, which is strongly beamed. Accurate estimations of the energy radiated during the prompt phase require taking into account the geometry of GRB jets, which remains poorly known. Nevertheless, one may establish the distribution of well measured quantities, like Eiso, the GRB isotropic equivalent energy, which encrypts crucial information about GRB jets, with the aim of providing constraints on the jets radiated energy. In this work, we study the bright end of the GRB isotropic equivalent energy distribution (hereafter called "apparent energy"), using an updated sample of 185 apparently energetic GRBs with Eiso $\geq 10^{53}$ erg. This new sample includes GRB 221009A, allowing to discuss this apparently super-energetic GRB in the context of the general Eiso distribution of long GRBs. We describe the construction of the sample and compare fits of the Eiso distribution with a simple power law, a cutoff power law and a broken power law. Our study confirms the existence of a cutoff around Eiso = $4\times10^{54}$ erg, even when GRB 221009A is included in the sample. Based on this finding, we discuss the possible reasons behind the rapid decrease of the number of apparently energetic gamma-ray bursts beyond Eiso = $4\times10^{54}$ erg and the interpretation of GRB 221009A, the most apparently energetic GRB detected to date, in this context.</description>

      <title>Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs). Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.</description>

      <title>The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (I): Revealing the energy source with photometry and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are too luminous and radiate too much total energy to be powered by the release of thermal energy from the ejecta and radioactive-decay energy from the synthesised $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co. A source of additional power is the interaction between the supernova (SN) ejecta and a massive circumstellar material (CSM). This is an important power source in Type IIn SNe, which show narrow spectral lines arising from the unshocked CSM, but not all interacting SNe show such narrow lines. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the hydrogen-rich SN 2021irp, which is both luminous, with $M_{o} &lt; -19.4$ mag, and long-lived, remaining brighter than $M_{o} = -18$ mag for $\sim$ 250 d. We show that an additional energy source is required to power such a SN, and determine the nature of the source. We also investigate the properties of the pre-existing and newly formed dust associated with the SN. Photometric observations show that the luminosity of the SN is an order of magnitude higher than typical Type II SNe and persists for much longer. We detect a infrared excess attributed to dust emission. Spectra show multi-component line profiles, an Fe II pseudo-continuum, and a lack of absorption lines, all typical features of Type IIn SNe. We detect a narrow (&lt; 85 kms$^{-1}$) P-Cygni profile associated with the unshocked CSM. An asymmetry in emission line profiles indicates dust formation occurring from 250-300 d. Analysis of the SN blackbody radius evolution indicates asymmetry in the shape of the emitting region. We identify the main power source of SN 2021irp as extensive interaction with a massive CSM, and that this CSM is distributed asymmetrically around the progenitor star. The infrared excess is explained with emission from newly formed dust although there is also some evidence of an IR echo from pre-existing dust at early times.</description>

      <title>The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (II): Estimating the CSM mass and geometry with polarimetry and light curve modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is evidence for interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and massive circumstellar material (CSM) in various types of SNe. The mass-ejection mechanisms that produce massive CSM are unclear, and studying interacting SNe and their CSM can shed light on these mechanisms and the final stages of stellar evolution. We aim to study the properties of the CSM in the bright, long-lived, hydrogen-rich (Type II) SN 2021irp, which is interacting with a massive aspherical CSM. We present imaging- and spectro-polarimetric observations of SN 2021irp. By modelling its polarisation and bolometric light curve, we derive the mass and distribution of the CSM. SN 2021irp shows a high intrinsic polarisation of $\sim0.8$%. This high continuum polarisation suggests an aspherical photosphere created by an aspherical CSM interaction. Based on the bolometric light curve evolution and the high polarization, SN 2021irp can be explained as a typical Type II SN interacting with a CSM disk with a corresponding mass-loss rate and half-opening angle of $\sim0.035$ - $0.1$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim30$ - $50^{\circ}$, respectively. The total CSM mass derived is $\gtrsim 2$ M$_{\odot}$. We suggest that this CSM disk was created by some process related to binary interaction, and that SN 2021irp is the end product of a typical massive star (i.e. with Zero-Age-Main-Sequence mass of $\sim 8-18$ M$_{\odot}$) that has a separation and/or mass ratio with its companion star that led to an extreme mass ejection within decades of explosion. Based on the observational properties of SN 2021irp and similar SNe, we propose a general picture for the spectroscopic properties of Type II SNe interacting with a massive disk CSM.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and collisionality in firehose-susceptible high-$\beta$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfv\'en-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfv\'en-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfv\'en waves and Alfv\'enic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfv\'en-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfv\'en-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.</description>

      <title>Micro-Tidal Disruption Events at Galactic Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a scenario of a micro-Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) associated with high-speed white dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. It happens at galactic centers, where a white dwarf orbiting around the massive black hole scatters with a stellar-mass black hole in its early extreme mass-ratio inspiral stage. We estimate the formation rate, perform a series of hydro simulations to investigate the amount of accreted and unbound mass as a function of impact radius and speed, and discuss the main EM signatures: an X-ray flare (micro-TDE) followed by a relatively faint (TDE-type) optical flare. The properties of some of the transient X-ray bursts found by Einstein Probe are consistent with the micro-TDE scenario considered here.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Line of Sight to Galaxies Detected at Gamma-ray Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale Universal structure comprises strands of dark matter and galaxies with large under-dense volumes known as voids. We measure the fraction of the line of sight that intersects voids for active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This ``voidiness'' fraction is a rudimentary proxy for the density along the line of sight to the galaxies. The voidiness of SDSS-observed quasars (QSOs) is distinctly different from randomly distributed source populations, with a median p-value of $4.6\times10^{-5}$ and $\ll 1\times10^{-7}$, when compared with 500 simulated populations with randomly simulated locations but matching redshifts in the $0.1\leq z&lt;0.4$ and $0.4\leq z &lt; 0.7$ intervals, respectively. A similar comparison of the voidiness for LAT-detected AGN shows median p-values greater than 0.05 in each redshift interval. When comparing the SDSS QSO population to the LAT-detected AGN, we mitigate potential bias from a relationship between redshift and voidiness by comparing the LAT-detected AGN to a ``redshift-matched'' set of SDSS QSOs. The LAT-detected AGN between a redshift of 0.4 and 0.7 show higher voidiness compared to the redshift-matched SDSS QSO populations, with a median p-value of 2.3$\times10^{-5}$, (a $4.1\sigma$ deviation). No deviation is found when comparing the same populations between redshifts of 0.1 and 0.4 (p&gt;0.05). We do not study possible causes of this voidiness difference. It might relate to propagation effects from lower magnetic or radiative background fields within voids or to an environment more favorable for gamma-ray production for AGN near voids.</description>

      <title>The neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.</description>

      <title>CosmiXs: Improved spectra for dark matter indirect detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra of stable particles produced from dark matter (DM) are one of the most important ingredients to calculate the fluxes for DM indirect detection experiments. At energies above a few GeV, most of the particles are produced following a complex sequence of phenomena including resonance decays, QED and QCD final-state radiation, radiation of weak gauge bosons, hadronization and hadron decays. In this contribution, we discuss improvements on the calculation of the energy spectra at the source using state-of-the-art tools that include effects that were not taken previously into account. We include helicity information of the particles produced in the annihilation channels, which leads to proper inclusion of electroweak radiation during the entire showering history. These effects are taken into account using the Vincia, which is based on the helicity-dependent antenna shower formalism. Off-shell contributions are also taken into account for annihilation channels into $WW$ and $ZZ$ through the four-body processes into fermions and for DM masses below the gauge boson mass. We also revisit the tune of the Lund fragmentation function parameters in Pythia using LEP data at the $Z$-boson pole. The spectra of cosmic messengers are provided for DM masses between 5 GeV and 100 GeV and are publicly distributed in this \href{https://github.com/ajueid/CosmiXs.git}{GitHub repository}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An isolated supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) produces an identical cross-correlation pattern of pulsar timings as an isotropic stochastic background gravitational waves (GWs) generated possibly by inflation. Can there remain the identical cross-correlation pattern in the presence of a secondary SMBHB? To address this issue, the present paper considers GWs with slightly different frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ coming from two different directions. Beats between the two GWs can modify angular correlation patterns. The beat-induced correlation patterns are not stationary but modulated with a beat frequency $f_{beat} \equiv |f_1 - f_2|$. We obtain an analytic formula to present a proof-of-principle that $f_{beat}$ can be measured from the modulated angular correlations.</description>

      <title>What is Inside the Double-Double Structure of the Radio Galaxy J0028+0035?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio source J0028+0035 is a recently discovered double--double radio galaxy at redshift z=0.398. Its relic outer lobes are separated by about 3' in the sky, corresponding to ~1 Mpc projected linear size. Inside this large-scale structure, the inner pair of collinear lobes span about 100 kpc. In the arcsec-resolution radio images of J0028+0035, there is a central radio feature that offers the intriguing possibility of being resolved into a pc-scale, third pair of innermost lobes. This would make this radio galaxy a rare triple-double source where traces of three distinct episodes of radio activity could be observed. To reveal the compact radio structure of the central component, we conducted observation with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer Network and the enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network. Our 1.66 GHz image with high (~5 milliarcsec) resolution shows a compact central radio core with no indication of a third, innermost double feature. The observation performed in multi-phase-centre mode also revealed that the physically unrelated but in projection closely separated background source 5BZU J0028+0035 has a single weak, somewhat resolved radio feature, at odds with its blazar classification.</description>

      <title>Orbital Motion in Spacetimes Influenced by the Presence of Scalar and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study investigates orbital motion of test particles near compact objects described by solutions involving massless scalar fields, electromagnetic fields, and nonlinear electrodynamics. Specifically, we analyze orbital dynamics in the Janis-Newman-Winicour, Janis-Newman-Winicour-Maxwell, Schwarzschild-Melvin, and Bonnor-Melvin spacetimes, comparing the results with those obtained for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions. We examine the stability of circular orbits and the behavior of epicyclic frequencies under varying physical parameters. Our analysis shows that in certain cases the central object transitions into a naked singularity. Deviations from classical Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions reveal conditions for the existence of multiple photon orbits or marginally stable orbits. In some instances, the geometry allows the presence of two photon orbits -- one stable and one unstable -- with an interesting connection to the region of stable orbits. We find that at lower intensities, the effects of the scalar field and electromagnetic fields are comparable and seemingly interchangeable. However, for a sufficiently strong scalar field, its influence becomes dominant, leading to the emergence of a distinct region of stable orbits near the naked singularity. These effects are illustrated within the framework of optical geometry using embedding diagrams.</description>

      <title>Optical Images of Mini Boson Stars in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of mini boson stars within the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, adopting a quadratic form $f(R) = R + \xi R^2$, where $\xi$ is the gravitational coupling constant. By deriving the modified scalar Lagrangian and solving the field equations numerically, we explore photon trajectories and the resulting optical images under spherical light sources and thin accretion disks. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes (BHs), boson stars lack stable photon rings due to the positive second derivative of their effective potential. Consequently, their images are dominated by direct emissions from photons completing a single orbit. The study examines the dependence of the optical characteristics on the initial scalar field $\psi_0$ and the coupling parameter $\xi$. Numerical results include effective potentials, redshift maps, and detailed imaging of boson stars, providing insights into distinguishing boson stars from black holes using high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Can $\nu$DM interactions solve the $S_8$ discrepancy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present compelling evidence that Dark Matter (DM)-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing (WL) surveys and leveraging an emulator based on true $N$-body simulations to account for nonlinear corrections, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with DES Y3 cosmic shear data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ detection of non-zero DM-neutrino interactions, marking a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Redshift leverage for the search of GRB neutrinos affected by quantum properties of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some previous studies based on IceCube neutrinos had found intriguing preliminary evidence that some of them might be GRB neutrinos with travel times affected by quantum properties of spacetime delaying them proportionally to their energy, an effect often labeled as "quantum-spacetime-induced in-vacuo dispersion". Those previous studies looked for candidate GRB neutrinos in a fixed (neutrino-energy-independent) time window after the GRB onset and relied rather crucially on crude estimates of the redshift of GRBs whose redshift has not been measured. We here introduce a complementary approach to the search of quantum-spacetime-affected GRB neutrinos which restricts the analysis to GRBs of sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with having sharp information on redshift, adopts a neutrino-energy-dependent time window. We find that knowing the redshift of the GRBs strengthens the analysis enough to compensate for the fact that of course the restriction to GRBs of known redshift reduces the number of candidate GRB neutrinos. And rather remarkably our estimate of the magnitude of the in-vacuo-dispersion effects is fully consistent with what had been found using the previous approach. Our findings are still inconclusive, since their significance is quantified by a $p$-value of little less than $0.01$, but provide motivation for monitoring the accrual of neutrino observations by IceCube and KM3NeT as well as for further refinements of the strategy of analysis here proposed.</description>

      <title>Long-term spin-down and low luminosity regime in the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX 304-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out timing and spectral studies of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX 304-1 using NuStar and XMM-Newton observations. We construct the long-term spin period evolution of the pulsar which changes from a long-term spin-up ($\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-13} $Hz \~s$^{-1}$) to a long-term spin-down ($\sim -3.4 \times 10^{-14} $Hz \~s$^{-1}$) trend during a low luminosity state ($\sim 10^{34-35} $erg \~s$^{-1}$). A prolonged low luminosity regime ($L_X \sim 10^{34-35} $erg \~s$^{-1}$) was detected during 2005-2010 and spanning nearly five years since 2018 December. The XMM-Newton and NuStar spectra can be described with a power law plus blackbody model having an estimated luminosity of $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{33} $erg \~s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 3.6 \times 10^{33} $erg \~s$^{-1}$ respectively. The inferred radius of the blackbody emission is about 100-110 m which suggests a polar-cap origin of this component. From long-term ultraviolet observations of the companion star, an increase in the ultraviolet signatures is detected preceding the X-ray outbursts. The spectral energy distribution of the companion star is constructed which provides a clue of possible UV excess when X-ray outbursts were detected from the neutron star compared to the quiescent phase. We explore plausible mechanisms to explain the long-term spin-down and extended low luminosity manifestation in this pulsar. We find that sustained accretion from a cold disc may explain the prolonged low luminosity state of the pulsar since December 2018 but the pulsar was undergoing normal accretion during the low luminosity period spanning 2005-2010.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Pulse Widths of FRB 20121102A and Calculation of Broadening from Propagation and Instrumental Effects</title>

Abstract: The pulse widths of fast radio bursts are always broadened due to the scattering of the plasma medium through which the electromagnetic wave passes. The recorded pulse width will be further affected by the radio telescopes since the sampling time and the bandwidth cannot be infinitely small. In this study, we focus on the pulse widths of at least 3287 bursts detected from FRB 20121102A as of October 2023. Various effects such as the scattering broadening, the redshift-induced broadening and the instrumental broadening are examined. At a redshift of 0.193, the pulse width is broadened by a factor of approximately 0.16 due to cosmological time dilation. It is found that the instrumental broadening only contributes a fraction of $10^{-3}$ -- $10^{-1}$ to the observed pulse width. The scattering broadening is even smaller, which constitutes a tiny fraction of $10^{-5}$ -- $10^{-2}$ in the observed pulse width. After correcting for these broadenings, the intrinsic pulse width is derived for each burst. The maximum and minimum pulse widths at different frequencies are highlighted. The intrinsic widths of most bursts are in a narrow range of 1 -- 10 ms, which leads to a quasi-linear correlation between the fluence and the peak flux. Besides, the mean value and the dispersion range of intrinsic pulse width are found to scale with the central frequency as $\nu^{-1.2 \pm 0.2}$ and $\nu^{-1.7 \pm 0.6}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum Plasma Creation near a Magnetar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars in quiescent states continue to emit hard X-rays with a power far exceeding the loss of rotational energy. It has recently been noted that this hard X-ray continuum may bear a direct signature of quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects in magnetic fields stronger than the Schwinger field ($B_{\rm Q} = 4.4\times 10^{13}$ G). Where the current flowing into the magnetosphere is driven by narrow structures in the solid crust, the $e^\pm$ pair plasma supporting the current relaxes to a collisional and trans-relativistic state. The decay of a pair into two photons produces a broad, bremsstrahlung-like spectrum of hard X-rays, similar to that observed and extending up to $0.5-1$ MeV. The conversion of two gamma rays to a pair is further enhanced by a factor $\sim B/B_{\rm Q}$. Monte Carlo calculations of pair creation in a dipole magnetic field are presented. Non-local particle injection is found to be strong enough to suppress the high voltage that otherwise would accompany a weaker, global twist; the hard X-rays are mostly emitted away from the magnetic poles. Some of the pairs annihilate in an optically thin surface layer. The prototypical anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E 2259$+$586, which shows a hard X-ray continuum but relatively weak torque noise, slow spindown, and no radio emission, is a Rosetta Stone for understanding the magnetar circuit, consistent with the picture advanced here. For a $15-60$ keV luminosity as low as $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the polar flux of sub-relativistic pairs produces an optical depth $3-30$ to electron cyclotron scattering in the $1-10$ keV band, reducing the net X-ray polarization.</description>

      <title>Large-scale cosmic ray anisotropies with 19 years of data from the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

Abstract: Results are presented for the measurement of large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during 19 years of operation, prior to AugerPrime, the upgrade of the Observatory. The 3D dipole amplitude and direction are reconstructed above $4\,$EeV in four energy bins. Besides the established dipolar anisotropy in right ascension above $8\,$EeV, the Fourier amplitude of the $8$ to $16\,$EeV energy bin is now also above the $5\sigma$ discovery level. No time variation of the dipole moment above $8\,$EeV is found, setting an upper limit to the rate of change of such variations of $0.3\%$ per year at the $95\%$ confidence level. Additionally, the results for the angular power spectrum are shown, demonstrating no other statistically significant multipoles. The results for the equatorial dipole component down to $0.03\,$EeV are presented, using for the first time a data set obtained with a trigger that has been optimized for lower energies. Finally, model predictions are discussed and compared with observations, based on two source emission scenarios obtained in the combined fit of spectrum and composition above $0.6\,$EeV.</description>

      <title>Eruptive mass loss less than a year before the explosion of superluminous supernovae: I. The cases of SN 2020xga and SN 2022xgc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020xga and SN 2022xgc, two hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) at $z = 0.4296$ and $z = 0.3103$, respectively, which show an additional set of broad Mg II absorption lines, blueshifted by a few thousands kilometer second$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxy absorption system. Previous work interpreted this as due to resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding circumstellar material (CSM) expelled shortly before the explosion. The peak rest-frame $g$-band magnitude of SN 2020xga is $-22.30 \pm 0.04$ mag and of SN 2022xgc is $-21.97 \pm 0.05$ mag, placing them among the brightest SLSNe-I. We used high-quality spectra from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths to model the Mg II line profiles and infer the properties of the CSM shells. We find that the CSM shell of SN 2020xga resides at $\sim 1.3 \times 10^{16}~\rm cm$, moving with a maximum velocity of $4275~\rm km~s^{-1}$, and the shell of SN 2022xgc is located at $\sim 0.8 \times 10^{16}~\rm cm$, reaching up to $4400~\rm km~s^{-1}$. These shells were expelled $\sim 11$ and $\sim 5$ months before the explosions of SN 2020xga and SN 2022xgc, respectively, possibly as a result of luminous-blue-variable-like eruptions or pulsational pair instability (PPI) mass loss. We also analyzed optical photometric data and modeled the light curves, considering powering from the magnetar spin-down mechanism. The results support very energetic magnetars, approaching the mass-shedding limit, powering these SNe with ejecta masses of $\sim 7-9~\rm M_\odot$. The ejecta masses inferred from the magnetar modeling are not consistent with the PPI scenario pointing toward stars $&gt; 50~\rm M_\odot$ He-core; hence, alternative scenarios such as fallback accretion and CSM interaction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Accretion and Spin-up Through Stellar Collisions in Dense Star Clusters</title>

Abstract: Dynamical interactions in dense star clusters could significantly influence the properties of black holes, leaving imprints on their gravitational-wave signatures. While previous studies have mostly focused on repeated black hole mergers for spin and mass growth, this work examines the impact of physical collisions and close encounters between black holes and (non-compact) stars. Using Monte Carlo N-body models of dense star clusters, we find that a large fraction of black holes retained upon formation undergo collisions with stars. Within our explored cluster models, the proportion of binary black hole mergers affected by stellar collisions ranges from $10\%$ to $60\%$. If all stellar-mass black holes are initially non-spinning, we find that up to $40\%$ of merging binary black holes may have components with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.2$ because of prior stellar collisions, while typically about $10\%$ have spins near $\chi = 0.7$ from prior black hole mergers. We demonstrate that young star clusters are especially important environments as they can produce collisions of black holes with very massive stars, allowing significant spin up of the black holes through accretion. Our predictions for black hole spin distributions from these stellar collisions highlight their sensitivity to accretion efficiency, underscoring the need for detailed hydrodynamic calculations to better understand the accretion physics following these interactions.</description>

Abstract: Over a hundred gravitational-wave signals have now been detected from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, but other sources of gravitational waves have not yet been discovered. Some of the most violent explosive events in the Universe are predicted to emit bursts of gravitational waves, and may result in the next big multi-messenger discovery. Gravitational-wave burst signals often have an unknown waveform shape, and unknown gravitational-wave energy, due to unknown or very complicated progenitor astrophysics. Potential sources of gravitational-wave bursts include core-collapse supernovae, cosmic strings, fast radio bursts, eccentric binary systems, and gravitational-wave memory. In this review, we discuss the astrophysical properties of the main predicted sources of gravitational-wave bursts, and the known features of their gravitational-wave emission. We summarise their future detection prospects, and discuss the challenges of searching for gravitational-wave burst signals and interpreting the astrophysics of the source.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of electron magnetohydrodynamics with Landau-quantized electrons in magnetar crusts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetar crusts, magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to confine electrons into a small to moderate number of quantized Landau levels. This can have a dramatic effect on the crust's thermodynamic properties, generating field-dependent de Haas--van Alphen oscillations. We previously argued that the large-amplitude oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility could enhance the Ohmic dissipation of the magnetic field by continuously generating small-scale, rapidly dissipating field features. This could be important to magnetar field evolution and contribute to their observed higher temperatures. To study this, we performed quasi-3D numerical simulations of electron MHD in a representative volume of neutron star crust matter, for the first time including the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility resulting from Landau quantization. We find that the potential enhancement in the Ohmic dissipation rate due to this effect can be a factor $\sim 3$ for temperatures of the order of $10^8$ K and $\sim 4.5$ for temperatures of the order of $5\times10^7$ K, depending on the magnetic field configuration. The nonlinear Hall term is crucial to this amplification: without it the magnetic field decay is only enhanced by a factor $\lesssim 2$ even at $5\times10^7$ K. These effects generate a high wavenumber plateau in the magnetic energy spectrum associated with the small-scale de Haas--van Alphen oscillations. Our results suggest that this mechanism could help explain the magnetar heating problem, though due to the effect's temperature-dependence, full magneto-thermal evolution simulations in a realistic stellar model are needed to judge whether it is viable explanation.</description>

      <title>3D Localization of FRB 20190425A for Its Potential Host Galaxy and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are high-energy, short-duration phenomena in radio astronomy. Identifying their host galaxies can provide insights into their mysterious origins. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies in three-dimensional space. We use FRB 20190425A and GW190425 as an example to illustrate our method. Recently, due to spatial and temporal proximity, the potential association of GW190425 with FRB 20190425A has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. We search for the host galaxy of FRB 20190425A with a full CHIME localization map. Regardless of the validity of the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, we identify an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. We employed various methodologies to determine the most probable host galaxy of GW190424 and FRB 20190425A, including a comparison of galaxy properties and constraints on their reported observation limits using various Kilonova models. Our analysis suggests that current observations do not definitively identify the true host galaxy. Additionally, the Kilonova models characterized by a gradual approach to their peak are contradicted by the observational upper limits of both galaxies. Although the absence of optical emission detection raises doubts, it does not definitively disprove the connection between GW and FRB.</description>

      <title>GRB$\,$220831A: a hostless, intermediate Gamma-ray burst with an unusual optical afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB$\,$220831A is a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration and spectral peak energy that places it at the interface between the distribution of long-soft and short-hard GRBs. In this paper, we present the multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to GRB$\,$220831A and its optical, near-infrared, X-ray and radio counterparts. Our deep optical and near-infrared observations do not reveal an underlying host galaxy, and establish that GRB$\,$220831A is observationally hostless to depth, $m_i\gtrsim26.6$ AB mag. Based on the Amati relation and the non-detection of an accompanying supernova, we find that this GRB is most likely to have originated from a collapsar at $z&gt;2$, but it could also possibly be a compact object merger at $z&lt;0.4$ with a large separation distance from its host galaxy. Regardless of its origin, we show that its optical and near-infrared counterpart departs from the evolution expected from a forward shock dominated synchrotron afterglow, exhibiting a steep post-break temporal powerlaw index of $-3.83^{+0.62}_{-0.79}$, too steep to be the jet-break. By analysing a range of models, we find that the observed steep departure from forward shock closure relations is likely due to an internal process producing either a flare or a plateau.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Models of Black Hole Photon Rings from Low-Luminosity Accretion Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Images of black holes encode both astrophysical and gravitational properties. Detecting highly-lensed features in images can differentiate between these two effects. We present an accretion disk emission model coupled to the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code that allows a fast parameter space exploration of black hole photon ring images produced from synchrotron emission from 10 to 670 GHz. As an application, we systematically study several disk models and compute their total flux density, average radii, and optical depth. The model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*. For the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between optically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon ring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of photon ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models, the highly lensed photon ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that at low frequencies, the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while at higher frequencies, the magnetic field strength plays a more significant role, demonstrating how multi-frequency analysis can also be used to infer plasma parameters. Lastly, we show how our implementation can qualitatively reproduce multifrequency black hole images from GRMHD simulations when adding time-variability to our disk model through Gaussian random fields. This approach provides a new method for simulating observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space mission.</description>

      <title>Universal Constants and Energy Integral in Self-Organized Criticality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence frequency distributions of fluxes (F) and fluences or energies (E) observed in astrophysical observations are found to be consistent with the predictions of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which predicts power law slopes with universal constants of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux and $\alpha_E=(5/3)\approx 1.67$ for the fluence. The energy integrated over the power law-like (size distribution) energy range is found to be finite for these power law slopes with $\alpha_E &lt; 2$, which refutes earlier claims of a divergent energy integral that has been postulated in the energy budget of solar and stellar nanoflare scenarios. The theoretial FD-SOC model approximates the microscopic cellular automaton models satisfactorily with the macroscopic scaling law of classical diffusion. The universal scaling laws predict the size distributions of numerous astrophysical phenomena, such as solar flares, stellar flares, coronal mass ejections (CME), auroras, blazars, galactic fast radio bursts (FRB), active galactic nuclei (AGN), gamma-ray bursts (GRB), soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGB), and black-hole systems (BH), while coherent solar radio bursts, random radio bursts, solar energetic partices (SEP), cosmic rays, and pulsar glitches require non-standard SOC models.</description>

      <title>The puzzling long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 191019A was a long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting about 65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z=0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus re-analyzed unpublished GROND multi-color (g'r'i'z'JHK_s) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days post trigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days post-burst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of about 0.06 solar mass. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0=10^7-10^8 cm^-3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 = 1 cm^-3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope UV observations of an X-ray quasi-periodic eruption source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel mode of variability in nearby galactic nuclei whose origin remains unknown. Their multi-wavelength properties are poorly constrained, as studies have focused almost entirely on the X-ray band. Here we report on time-resolved, coordinated Hubble Space Telescope far ultraviolet and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the shortest period X-ray QPE source currently known, eRO-QPE2. We detect a bright UV point source ($L_{\rm FUV} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) that does not show statistically significant variability between the X-ray eruption and quiescent phases. This emission is unlikely to be powered by a young stellar population in a nuclear stellar cluster. The X-ray-to-UV spectral energy distribution can be described by a compact accretion disk ($R_{\rm out} = 343^{+202}_{-138} \ R_{\rm g}$). Such compact disks are incompatible with typical disks in active galactic nuclei, but form naturally following the tidal disruption of a star. Our results rule out models (for eRO-QPE2) invoking i) a classic AGN accretion disk and ii) no accretion disk at all. For orbiter models, the expected radius derived from the timing properties would naturally lead to disk-orbiter interactions for both quasi-spherical and eccentric trajectories. We infer a black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}) = 5.9 \pm 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$ and Eddington ratio of 0.13$^{+0.18}_{-0.07}$; in combination with the compact outer radius this is inconsistent with existing disk instability models. After accounting for the quiescent disk emission, we constrain the ratio of X-ray to FUV luminosity of the eruption component to be $L_{\rm X} / L_{\rm FUV} &gt; 16-85$ (depending on the intrinsic extinction).</description>

      <title>Discovery of a likely Type II SN at $z$=3.6 with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z &gt; 3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~30 AB mag) over a relatively wide area (25 arcmin^2). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of 28.04 AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with z_spec = 3.613 +/- 0.001 and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z_* = 0.3 +/- 0.1 Z_{\odot}. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP with a peak absolute magnitude of M_B ~ -18.3 AB mag. We find a good match to a 20 M_{\odot} red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of 2.0x10^51 ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested disk flux eruption events to describe SgrA* flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Magnetically arrested disks are among the most suitable candidates for describing the gas accretion and observed emission in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Aims. This work aims to provide a direct correlation between the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD accretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic center. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct counter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux tubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux tubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by the accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots, formed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they travel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light. Results. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance out the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk and demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with the NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor face-on inclinations in the range $[0^\circ, 34^\circ]$ and $[163^\circ, 180^\circ]$ for SgrA*. Conclusions. The flux eruption events that arise naturally in the MAD accretion state provide a promising framework for reproducing the observed flaring behavior in the vicinity of SgrA*.</description>

      <title>Do Finite Density Effects Jeopardize Axion Nucleophobia in Supernovae?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleophobic axion models, wherein axion couplings to both protons and neutrons are simultaneously suppressed, can relax the stringent constraints from SN 1987A. However, it remains uncertain whether these models maintain their nucleophobic property under the influence of finite baryon density effects. These are especially relevant in astrophysical environments near saturation density, such as Supernovae (SNe). In this study, we demonstrate that the nucleophobic solution remains viable also at finite density. Furthermore, we show that the SN axion bound relaxes significantly in nucleophobic models, even when accounting for the integration over the non-homogeneous environment of the SN core.</description>

      <title>Shaping Outflows and Jets by Ambient Pressure: a Unified Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>Mass-transferring binary stars as progenitors of interacting hydrogen-free supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are H-poor transients produced at the end of the life of massive stars that previously lost their H-rich envelope. Their progenitors are thought to be donor stars in mass-transferring binary systems, which were stripped of their H-rich envelopes some $10^6$yr before core collapse. A subset of the stripped-envelope SNe exhibit spectral and photometric features indicative of interaction between their ejecta and nearby circumstellar material (CSM). We examine whether mass transfer during, or shortly before, core collapse in massive binary systems can produce the CSM inferred from the observations of interacting H-poor SNe. We select 44 models from a comprehensive grid of detailed binary evolution models in which the mass donors are H-free and explode while transferring mass to a main-sequence companion. We find that in these models, mass transfer starts less than $\sim20$kyr before, and often continues until the core collapse of the donor star. Up to $0.8M_\odot$ of H-free material are removed from the donor star during this phase, which may produce a He-rich circumbinary material. We explore plausible assumptions for its spatial distribution at the time of explosion. When assuming that the CSM accumulates in a circumbinary disk, we find qualitative agreement with the supernova and CSM properties inferred from observed Type Ibn SNe, and to a lesser extent with constraints from Type Icn SNe. We find that our mass transferring stripped envelope SN progenitor models may produce up to $\sim$10% of all stripped envelope supernovae. The binary channel proposed in this work can qualitatively account for the observed key properties and rate of interacting H-poor SNe. Models for the evolution of the circumbinary material and the spectral evolution of exploding progenitors from this channel are needed to further test its significance.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photons from intermediate-mass to very massive stars with PARSEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.</description>
