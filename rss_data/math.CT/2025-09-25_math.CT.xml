      <title>Learners are Almost Free Compact Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The category of learners has a pleasant symmetric formulation when the morphisms are considered up to a coarser equivalence than the one originally described in the paper "Backprop as Functor". A quotient of this modified category gives a new construction of the free compact closed category on a symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Formal category theory in $\infty$-equipments I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize proarrow equipments from strict category theory to the $\infty$-categorical setting, introducing the concept of $\infty$-equipments. These are specific double $\infty$-categories that support an internal higher category theory. This paper explores several examples of $\infty$-equipments, including the prototypical example of the $\infty$-equipment of $\infty$-categories and the more general $\infty$-equipments of internal $\infty$-categories. The ultimate objective of this article is to study the basic concepts of category theory within an arbitrary $\infty$-equipment, such as colimits and Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gradient Descent is a Hypergraph Functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.</description>

      <title>Representing Knowledge and Querying Data using Double-Functorial Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category theory offers a mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and database systems. Popular existing approaches model a database instance as a functor into the category of sets and functions, or as a 2-functor into the 2-category of sets, relations, and implications. The functional and relational models are unified by double functors into the double category of sets, functions, relations, and implications. In an accessible, example-driven style, we show that the abstract structure of a 'double category of relations' is a flexible and expressive language in which to represent knowledge, and we show how queries on data in the spirit of Codd's relational algebra are captured by double-functorial semantics.</description>

      <title>Abstract Kleisli Structures on 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuhrmann introduced Abstract Kleisli structures to model call-by-value programming languages with side effects, and showed that they correspond to monads satisfying a certain equalising condition on the unit. We first extend this theory to non-strict morphisms of monads, and to incorporate 2-cells of monads. We then further extend this to a theory of abstract Kleisli structures on 2-categories, characterising when the original pseudomonad can be recovered by the abstract Kleisli structure on its 2-category of free-pseudoalgebras.

      <title>Presenting Profunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by problems in categorical database theory, we introduce and compare two notions of presentation for profunctors, uncurried and curried, which arise intuitively from thinking of profunctors either as functors C^op x D -&gt; Set or C^op -&gt; Set^D. Although the Cartesian closure of Cat means these two perspectives can be used interchangeably at the semantic level, a surprising amount of subtlety is revealed when looking through the lens of syntax. Indeed, we prove that finite uncurried presentations are strictly more expressive than finite curried presentations, hence the two notions do not induce the same class of finitely presentable profunctors. Moreover, an explicit construction for the composite of two curried presentations shows that the class of finitely curried presentable profunctors is closed under composition, in contrast with the larger class of finitely uncurried presentable profunctors, which is not. This shows that curried profunctor presentations are more appropriate for computational tasks that use profunctor composition. We package our results on curried profunctor presentations into a double equivalence from a syntactic double category into the double category of profunctors. Finally, we study the relationship between curried and uncurried presentations, leading to the introduction of curryable presentations. These constitute a subcategory of uncurried presentations which is equivalent to the category of curried presentations, therefore acting as a bridge between the two syntactic choices.</description>

      <title>Combs, Causality and Contractions in Atomic Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a counterexample showing that Markov categories with conditionals (such as BorelStoch) need not validate a natural scheme of axioms which we call contraction identities. These identities hold in every traced monoidal category, so in particular this shows that BorelStoch cannot be embedded in any traced monoidal category. We remedy this under the additional assumption of atomicity: Atomic Markov categories validate all contraction identities, and furthermore admit a notion of trace defined for non-signalling morphisms. We conclude that atomic Markov categories admit an intrinsic calculus of combs without having to assume an embedding into a compact-closed category.</description>

      <title>Organizing Physics with Open Energy-Driven Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organizing physics has been a long-standing preoccupation of applied category theory, going back at least to Lawvere. We contribute to this research thread by noticing that Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient descent depend crucially on a consistent choice of transformation -- which we call a reaction structure -- from the cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle. We then construct a compositional theory of reaction structures. Reaction-based systems offer a different perspective on composition in physics than port-Hamiltonian systems or open classical mechanics, in that reaction-based composition does not create any new constraints that must be solved for algebraically. The technical contributions of this paper are the development of symmetric monoidal categories of open energy-driven systems and open differential equations, and a functor between them, functioning as a "functorial semantics" for reaction structures. This approach echoes what has previously been done for open games and open gradient-based learners, and in fact subsumes the latter. We then illustrate our theory by constructing an n-fold pendulum as a composite of n-many pendula.</description>

      <title>Pattern Runs on Matter: The Free Monad Monad as a Module over the Cofree Comonad Comonad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interviews run on people, programs run on operating systems, voting schemes run on voters, games run on players. Each of these is an example of the abstraction pattern runs on matter. Pattern determines the decision tree that governs how a situation can unfold, while matter responds with decisions at each juncture. 
  In this article, we will give a straightforward and concrete construction of the free monad monad for the category of polynomial functors with the substitution monoidal product.  Although the free monad has been well-studied in other contexts, the construction we give is streamlined and explicitly illustrates how the free monad represents terminating decision trees. We will also explore the naturally arising interaction between the free monad and cofree comonad. Again, while the interaction itself is known, the perspective we take is the free monad as a module over the cofree comonad. Lastly, we will give four applications of the module action to interviews, computer programs, voting, and games. In each example, we will see how the free monad represents pattern, the cofree comonad represents matter, and the module action represents runs on. </description>

      <title>Copy-composition for Probabilistic Graphical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In probabilistic modelling, joint distributions are often of more interest than their marginals, but the standard composition of stochastic channels is defined by marginalization. Last year at ACT, the notion of 'copy-composition' was introduced in order to circumvent this problem and express the chain rule of the relative entropy fibrationally, but while that goal was achieved, copy-composition lacked a satisfactory origin story. Here, we supply such a story for two standard probabilistic tools: directed and undirected graphical models. We explain that (directed) Bayesian networks may be understood as ''stochastic terms'' of product type, in which context copy-composition amounts to a pull-push operation. Likewise, we show that (undirected) factor graphs compose by copy-composition. In each case, our construction yields a double fibration of decorated (co)spans. Along the way, we introduce a useful bifibration of measure kernels, to provide semantics for the notion of stochastic term, which allows us to generalize probabilistic modelling from product to dependent types.</description>

      <title>Fibrational Perspectives on Determinization of Finite-State Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an argued that automata may be usefully considered from a functorial perspective, introducing a general notion of "V-automaton" based on functors into V. This enables them to recover different standard notions of automata by choosing V appropriately, and they further analyzed the determinization for Rel-automata using the Kleisli adjunction between Set and Rel. In this paper, we revisit Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an's analysis from a fibrational perspective, building on Melli\`es and Zeilberger's recent alternative but related definition of categorical automata as functors satisfying the finitary fiber and unique lifting of factorizations property. In doing so, we improve the understanding of determinization in three regards: Firstly, we carefully describe the universal property of determinization in terms of forward-backward simulations. Secondly, we generalize the determinization procedure for Rel automata using a local adjunction between SpanSet and Rel, which provides us with a canonical forward simulation. Finally, we also propose an alternative determinization based on the multiset relative adjunction which retains paths, and we leverage this to provide a canonical forward-backward simulation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of (pointed) prenormal category, modelled after regular categories, but with the key notions of coequaliser and kernel pair replaced by those of cokernel and kernel. This framework provides a natural setting for extending certain classical results in algebra. We study the fundamental properties of prenormal categories, including a characterisation in terms of a factorisation system involving normal epimorphisms, and a categorical version of Noether's so-called `third isomorphism theorem'. We also present a range of examples, with the category of commutative monoids constituting a central one. In the second part of the paper we extend prenormality and its related properties to the non-pointed context, using kernels and cokernels defined relative to a distinguished class of trivial objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that pseudo functors from bicategories of spans are equivalent to Beck-Chevalley bifibrations, and therefore capture the relationships underlying the adjunctions suitable as semantics for existential quantification. This was further expanded upon by Dawson, Par\'e and Pronk in the context of double categories. By viewing hyperdoctrines from a double-categorical lens, this paper shows that we can also characterise the Frobenius property: (generalised) regular hyperdoctrines correspond to those lax symmetric monoidal double pseudofunctors from spans to quintets whose monoidal laxators provide companion commuter cells (in the sense of Par\'e). This suggests a new notion of regular double hyperdoctrine. As an application, we discuss how we can recover a form of graphical regular logic suitable for modelling specifications of systems (e.g., port-plugging systems) that compose operadically.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conservativity result for extensional type theories over propositional ones, i.e. dependent type theories with propositional computation rules, or computation axioms, using insights from homotopy type theory. The argument exploits a notion of canonical homotopy equivalence between contexts, and uses the notion of a category with attributes to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent types. Informally, our main result asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, reasoning with extensional or propositional type theories is equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new definition of higher-order DisCoCat (categorical compositional distributional) models where the meaning of a word is not a diagram, but a diagram-valued higher-order function. Our models can be seen as a variant of Montague semantics based on a lambda calculus where the primitives act on string diagrams rather than logical formulae. As a special case, we show how to translate from the Lambek calculus into Peirce's system beta for first-order logic. This allows us to give a purely diagrammatic treatment of higher-order and non-linear processes in natural language semantics: adverbs, prepositions, negation and quantifiers. The definition presented in this article comes with a proof-of-concept implementation in DisCoPy, the Python library for string diagrams.</description>

      <title>A minimal model for prestacks and morphisms of operadic algebras via Koszul duality for box operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prestacks are algebro-geometric objects whose defining relations are far from quadratic. Indeed, they are cubic and quartic, and moreover inhomogeneous. Similarly, a morphism of $P$-algebras for a (nonsymmetric) Koszul operad $P$ has inhomogeneous relations possibly of any arity. We show that box operads, a rectangular type of operads introduced in arXiv:2305.20036, constitute the correct framework to encode them and resolve their relations up to homotopy. Our first main result is a Koszul duality theory for box operads, extending the duality for (nonsymmetric) operads. In this new theory, the classical restriction of being quadratic is replaced by the notion of being \emph{thin-quadratic}, a condition referring to a particular class of ``thin'' operations. Our main cases of interest are the box operad $Morph(P)$ encoding morphisms of $P$-algebras and the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. We show that both $Morph(P)$ and $Lax$ are not Koszul. We then go on to remedy the situation by suitably restricting the respective Koszul dual box cooperads $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$ and $Lax^{\antishriek}$ to obtain our two main applications. As our second main result we establish a minimal model $Morph(P)_\infty$ for the box operad $Morph(P)$ as the cobar construction on a box subcooperad $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}_{p\leq 1}$ of $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$, hereby answering an open question by Markl in arXiv:math/0103052 (Problem 9). As expected, it encodes $\infty$-morphisms of $P_\infty$-algebras. As our third main result we establish a minimal model $Lax_{\infty}$ for the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. This sheds new light on Markl's question on the existence of an explicit cofibrant model for the operad encoding presheaves of algebras from arXiv:math/0103052 (Conjecture 31). Indeed, we answer the parallel question with presheaves viewed as prestacks in the positive.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Categorical Cybernetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that several major algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) fit into the framework of categorical cybernetics, that is to say, parametrised bidirectional processes. We build on our previous work in which we show that value iteration can be represented by precomposition with a certain optic. The outline of the main construction in this paper is: (1) We extend the Bellman operators to parametrised optics that apply to action-value functions and depend on a sample. (2) We apply a representable contravariant functor, obtaining a parametrised function that applies the Bellman iteration. (3) This parametrised function becomes the backward pass of another parametrised optic that represents the model, which interacts with an environment via an agent. Thus, parametrised optics appear in two different ways in our construction, with one becoming part of the other. As we show, many of the major classes of algorithms in RL can be seen as different extremal cases of this general setup: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, and deep RL. We see this as strong evidence that this approach is a natural one and believe that it will be a fruitful way to think about RL in the future. </description>

      <title>ViCAR: Visualizing Categories with Automated Rewriting in Coq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ViCAR, a library for working with monoidal categories in the Coq proof assistant. ViCAR provides definitions for categorical structures that users can instantiate with their own verification projects. Upon verifying relevant coherence conditions, ViCAR gives a set of lemmas and tactics for manipulating categorical structures. We also provide a visualizer that can display any composition and tensor product of morphisms as a string diagram, showing its categorical structure. This enables graphical reasoning and automated rewriting for Coq projects with monoidal structures.</description>

      <title>The Aldous$\unicode{x2013}$Hoover Theorem in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Aldous-Hoover Theorem concerns an infinite matrix of random variables whose distribution is invariant under finite permutations of rows and columns. It states that, up to equality in distribution, each random variable in the matrix can be expressed as a function only depending on four key variables: one common to the entire matrix, one that encodes information about its row, one that encodes information about its column, and a fourth one specific to the matrix entry.
  We state and prove the theorem within a category-theoretic approach to probability, namely the theory of Markov categories. This makes the proof more transparent and intuitive when compared to measure-theoretic ones. A key role is played by a newly identified categorical property, the Cauchy--Schwarz axiom, which also facilitates a new synthetic de Finetti Theorem.
  We further provide a variant of our proof using the ordered Markov property and the d-separation criterion, both generalized from Bayesian networks to Markov categories. We expect that this approach will facilitate a systematic development of more complex results in the future, such as categorical approaches to hierarchical exchangeability.</description>
