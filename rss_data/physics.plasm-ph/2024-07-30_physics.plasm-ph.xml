      <title>Interplay between the non-resonant streaming instability and self-generated pressure anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-thermal particles escaping from collisionless shocks into the surrounding medium can trigger a non-resonant streaming instability that converts parts of their drift kinetic energy into large amplitude magnetic field perturbations, and promote the confinement and acceleration of high energy cosmic rays. We present simulations of the instability using an hybrid-Particle-in-Cell approach including Monte Carlo collisions, and demonstrate that the development of the non-resonant mode is associated with important ion pressure anisotropies in the background plasma. Depending on the initial conditions, the anisotropies may act on the instability by lowering its growth and trigger secondary micro-instabilities. Introducing collisions with neutrals yield a strong reduction of the magnetic field amplification as predicted by linear fluid theory. In contrast, Coulomb collisions in fully ionized plasmas are found to mitigate the self-generated pressure anisotropies and promote the growth of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Use of current-potential patches to obtain fundamental improvements to the coils of magnetic fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central issue in the design of any magnetic fusion device is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. This paper explains how this could be done using the concept of current-potential patches that was developed in Todd Elder's thesis.</description>

      <title>A study of an air-breathing electrodeless plasma thruster discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma chemistry of main air components is implemented in a hybrid 2D axisymmetric simulation code to assess the air-breathing concept in an electrodeless plasma thruster. Relevant electron-heavy species collisions for diatomic molecules are included: rotational and vibrational excitation, dissociation and dissociative ionization. Plasma-wall interaction giving rise to associative recombination of atomic species into molecular species is included too. As reference, the plasma thruster is operated with Xe, at a power of 300W and a mass flow of 1mg/s. Simulations are run by injecting 1mg/s of N$_2$ and O independently for powers between 100 and 3000W. The performances and trends of plasma response for these propellants are similar to Xe, but displaced to powers between 1250 and 2000W. At optimum power, the thrust efficiency for N$_2$ and O surpasses that of Xe, due to the excess of re-ionization for Xe. Performances of 50/50 mixtures of N$_2$/O, which are a realistic composition in the ionosphere, are found to be linear combinations of the performances of each propellant. Performances using O$_2$, which could be generated from associative recombination of O at the intake, are very similar to those of the atomic oxygen.</description>

      <title>Collisionless zonal-flow dynamics in quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear collisionless plasma response to a zonal density perturbation in quasisymmetric stellarators is studied, including the initial geodesic-acoustic-mode oscillations and the final Rosenbluth--Hinton residual flow. While the geodesic-acoustic-mode oscillations in quasiaxisymmetric configurations are similar to tokamaks, they become almost nonexistent in quasi-helically symmetric configurations when the effective safety factor is small. Compared with concentric circular tokamaks, the Rosenbluth--Hinton residual is also found to be multiplied by a geometric factor $\mathcal{C}$ that arises from the flux-surface averaged classical polarization. Using the near-axis-expansion framework, we derive an analytic expression for $\mathcal{C}$, which varies significantly among different configurations. These analytic results are compared with numerical simulation results from the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code GTC, and good agreement in the Rosenbluth--Hinton residual level is achieved only when the quasisymmetry error is small enough. Since zonal flows can be important for regulating turbulent transport, these results suggest possible relation between the transport level and the stellarator geometric parameters via nonlinear interactions with zonal flows.</description>

      <title>Polarization state control for high peak power applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous applications in the extreme field science are possible with circularly polarized high peak power ultrashort pulses. Commonly used quarter wave plates are not applicable here, while multi-mirror schemes are very complicated. We showed that the simple PET film $\approx$20 $\mu$m thick can be used to control the polarization state of the high peak power beam and achieve ellipticity of $\approx$0.8 with negligible nonlinear phase distortion. The film can withstand $10^3$ shots at intensity of $I = 3 \cdot 10^{12}$ W/cm$^2$ without visible damage. Thus, for a PW laser system and beam diameter of 20 cm the PET film can be used for quite a long time. We proved this experimentally using 1 TW femtosecond Ti:Sa laser measuring the angular distribution of the second harmonic from the plasma channel created in an undercritical gas plume.</description>

      <title>Moment-preserving Monte-Carlo Coulomb collision method for particle codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary-pairing Monte-Carlo methods are widely used in particle-in-cell codes to capture effects of small angle Coulomb collisions. These methods preserve momentum and energy exactly when the simulation particles have equal weights. However, when the interacting particles are of varying weight, these physical conservation laws are only preserved on average. Here, we 1) extend these methods to weighted particles such that the scattering physics is correct on average, and 2) describe a new method for adjusting the particle velocities post scatter to restore exact conservation of momentum and energy. The efficacy of the model is illustrated with various test problems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of laser wakefield acceleration in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) aiming to produce molybdenum-99 via photonuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the bubble regime demands ultra-short, high-peak-power laser pulses, operation in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) works with more relaxed pulse conditions, albeit at the cost of lower beam quality. Modern laser systems can deliver pulses with durations of a few tens of femtoseconds and peak powers on the order of a few terawatts, at kHz repetition rates. These systems are well-suited for developing SM-LWFA applications where high average energy and charge are prioritized over beam quality. Such beams could be used to generate high-energy bremsstrahlung photons, capable of triggering photonuclear reactions to produce radioisotopes like molybdenum-99. This isotope decays into technetium-99m, the most widely used medical radioisotope, with over 30 million applications worldwide per year. This work explores the use of Bayesian optimization to maximize the energy and charge of electron beams accelerated via SM-LWFA. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations model a 5 TW, 15 fs-long Gaussian laser pulse, propagating through tailored hydrogen gas-density profiles. In these simulations, over multiple iterations, the algorithm optimizes a set of input parameters characterizing the gas-density profile and the laser focal position. Three distinct profiles, with total lengths ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers and combining ramps and plateaus, were investigated. Optimal configurations were found to produce electron beams with median energies ranging from 14 to 17 MeV and charges of 600 to 1300 pC, considering electrons with energies above 8 MeV. Preliminary estimates of the molybdenum-99 yields for the optimal beams were obtained by employing their phase spaces, retrieved from PIC simulations, as radiation source inputs in Monte Carlo simulations irradiating a combined tantalum and molybdenum target.</description>

      <title>Shock Hugoniot calculations using on-the-fly machine learned force fields with ab initio accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for computing the shock Hugoniot using on-the-fly machine learned force field (MLFF) molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, we employ an MLFF model based on the kernel method and Bayesian linear regression to compute the electronic free energy, atomic forces, and pressure; in conjunction with a linear regression model between the electronic internal and free energies to compute the internal energy, with all training data generated from Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). We verify the accuracy of the formalism by comparing the Hugoniot for carbon with recent Kohn-Sham DFT results in the literature. In so doing, we demonstrate that Kohn-Sham calculations for the Hugoniot can be accelerated by up to two orders of magnitude, while retaining ab initio accuracy. We apply this framework to calculate the Hugoniots of 14 materials in the FPEOS database, comprising 9 single elements and 5 compounds, between temperatures of 10 kK and 2 MK. We find good agreement with first principles results in the literature while providing tighter error bars. In addition, we confirm that the inter-element interaction in compounds decreases with temperature.</description>
