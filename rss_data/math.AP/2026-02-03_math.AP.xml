      <title>Three self-similar solutions of Yang-Mills equations in high odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric Yang-Mills equations with gauge group $SO(d)$ in $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. For any given odd $d\geq 11$, we establish existence and uniqueness (modulo reflection symmetry) of exactly $N$ smooth self-similar solutions, where $N$ is the number of zeros of an explicit polynomial $P_m(z)$ of degree $m=(d-5)/2$ in the interval $0&lt;z&lt;1$. The number $N$ can be determined algorithmically by an explicit computation. We find that $N=3$ for all integer $m$ from $3$ to $15$, the upper bound being merely limited by the extent of our computations. A proof that $N=3$ for all odd $d\ge 11$ remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of an optimal control problem for nonlocal semilinear elasticity with soft inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic analysis of an optimal control problem (OCP) posed on a high-contrast elastic medium with soft periodic inclusions, governed by a semilinear elasticity system with a nonlocal term. The domain consists of a connected matrix phase and a soft inclusion phase. The model depends on two independent small parameters: the periodicity $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and the contrast $\delta&gt;0$, and the distributed control acts only in the inclusion region. We consider an $L^2$-tracking cost on the displacement and analyze the limit as $(\varepsilon,\delta)\to(0,0)$ in the regime
  \[
  \lim_{(\varepsilon,\delta)\to(0,0)}\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon}=\kappa\in(0,+\infty].
  \]
  First, we derive the homogenized (limit) state system associated with this scaling. We then formulate the limit OCP and prove that the limit of the microscopic optimal controls is an optimal control for the limit problem, using a $\Gamma$-convergence approach.</description>

      <title>Time Asymptotics and Scaling Limits for a Nonlocal Fokker-Planck Equation with Heavy-Tailed Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of a class of nonlocal Fokker--Planck equations defined by nonsingular, heavy-tailed convolution kernels and characterised by a scaling parameter $\e\in(0,1]$ and a fractional index $s\in(1/2,1)$. By employing a suitable version of the generalised central limit for heavy-tailed distributions and the use of Harris's theorem, we prove exponential convergence to the equilibrium with a rate that is independent of both $\e$ and $s$. This allows us to show uniform--in--time convergence for both $\e\to 0$ and $s\to1$ recovering the limiting equations.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of the multi-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the 2D and 3D compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system derived by Dunn and Serrin [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 88(2):95-133, 1985], which is widely used to describe compressible fluids with capillarity effects. Specifically, we prove that strong solutions exist globally for arbitrarily large initial data on the periodic torus. One of the key ingredients in the proof lies in establishing a novel critical control relation between the effective velocity and the lower bound of the density, i.e., the upper bound of the effective velocity is controlled by the square root of the logarithm of the reciprocal of the density's lower bound, which plays a crucial role in deriving the lower bound of the density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give two new characterizations of the bounded lower oscillation(BLO) space by using the Gaussian heat semigroup. By the new characterizations, we prove the regularity property of the solutions to the heat equation with BLO boundary value. Also, we reprove the BMO-BLO boundedness of the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function by using the semigroup method.</description>

      <title>Gaffney's Inequality and the Closed Range Property of the de Rham Complex in Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Poincar\'e estimate establishes closedness of the range of the gradient in unweighted $L^2(\Omega)$-spaces as long as $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ is contained in a slab, that is, $\Omega$ is bounded in one direction. Here, as a main observation, we provide closed range results for the $\operatorname{rot}$-operator, if (and only if) $\Omega$ is bounded in two directions. Along the way, we characterise closed range results for all the differential operators of the primal and dual de Rham complex in terms of directions of boundedness of the underlying domain.
  As a main application, one obtains the existence of a spectral gap near the $0$ of the Maxwell operator allowing for exponential stability results for solutions of Maxwell's equations with sufficient damping in the conductivity.
  Our results are based on the validity of Gaffney's (in)equality and the transition of the same to unbounded (simple) domains as well as on the stability of closed range results under bi-Lipschitz regular transformations. The latter technique is well-known and detailed in the appendix; for the results concerning Gaffney's estimate, we shall provide accessible, simple proofs using mere standard results.
  Moreover, we shall present non-trivial examples and a closed range result for $\operatorname{rot}$ with mixed boundary conditions on a set bounded in one direction only.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly concerned with the Liouville type problem for the stationary fractional magnetohydrodynamics(MHD) and stationary fractional Hall-MHD equations. In addition, we present the results of the Navier-Stokes equation as a byproduct. The key point is to use the Caffarelli-Sivestre extension to overcome the difficulty caused by the non-local operator $(-\triangle)^{s}$ and combined with Yuan and Xiao's method (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 491 (2020) 124343).</description>

      <title>Decay of solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations: the 2D case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of small solutions for a broad class of 2D Dirac-type equations with suitable nonlinearities. First, we prove that for nonlinearities with power $p\geq 5$ (massless case) and $p\geq7$ (massive case), any small globally bounded radial solution with vorticity $S\ne -1,0$ decays to zero locally in $L^2_{loc}$, as time tends to infinity. For solutions uniformly bounded in time in a weighted $H^1$ space, this decay result extends to lower powers $p\geq 3$ (massless) and $p\geq5$ (massive). Our main results apply to several physical models of current interest, such as the 2D Dirac equation with a honeycomb potential described by Fefferman and Weinstein. Finally, we rule out the existence of small, localized structures such as standing breathers or solitary waves in the 2D regimes considered. To prove these results, we introduce new virial identities with a particular algebra that are applied directly to the Dirac model, and without resorting to the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>On the blow-up of the vectorial Bernoulli free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of the blow-up limits of minimizers of the vectorial Bernoulli free boundary problem. Furthermore, we study the vectorial Bernoulli free boundary problem in a bounded box $D$, with a constraint $m$ on the measure of the positivity set, and the asymptotic of minimizers as the measure constraint $m$ tends to $|D|$. Such a study with a linear datum on the fixed boundary is the main ingredient for the characterization of the singular homogeneous global solutions of the vectorial problem and, thus, for the classification of the blow-up limits.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of contact vector fields with horizontal Sobolev regularity in Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the well-posedness of the transport and continuity equations in the Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n$ for a class of contact vector fields $\mathbf b$, under natural assumptions on the regularity of $\mathbf b$ not covered by the, now classical, Euclidean theory [18]. It is the first example of well-posedness in a genuine sub-Riemannian setting, that we obtain adapting to the $\mathbb{H}^n$ geometry the mollification strategy of [18]. In the final part of the paper we illustrate why our result is not covered by the Euclidean $BV$ case solved by the first author in [1], and we compare it with the strategy of [7], based on the representation of the commutator by interpolation \`a la Bakry-\'Emery and an integral representation of the symmetrized derivative of $\mathbf b$.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves near shear flows for the inhomogeneous Euler equations with non-constant density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions near monotonic shear flows with non-constant background density for the two-dimensional inhomogeneous Euler equations in a finite channel. For any small $\tau&gt;0$, first, we construct nontrivial traveling waves with velocity and density in $H^{5/2-\tau}$ and $H^{3/2-\tau}$, respectively, showing that inviscid damping fails at these regularities. Second, when the distorted Rayleigh operator has no eigenvalues, we prove that such traveling wave solutions cannot exist in higher regularity spaces ($H^{5/2+\tau}$ for velocity and $H^{3/2+\tau}$ for density).</description>

      <title>Geometric Integration by Parts and Sobolev Spaces on Vector Bundles: A Unified Global Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a unified framework for the theory of Sobolev spaces on vector bundles over Riemannian manifolds. The analytical core of our approach is a rigorous higher-order geometric integration by parts formula, which characterizes the formal adjoint of the covariant derivative. This identity is established for arbitrary manifolds, requiring no assumptions on completeness or compactness. While these results are fundamental to global analysis, explicit and direct proofs are often elusive in the literature or rely on overly sophisticated machinery that overshadows the underlying geometry. To bridge this gap, we establish sharp local-to-global norm equivalence estimates and provide streamlined, self-contained proofs for the Meyers-Serrin theorem on general manifolds, as well as the Sobolev embedding and Rellich-Kondrashov theorems for the compact case. By prioritizing intrinsic global arguments over ad hoc coordinate patching, this work provides a modern and accessible foundation for the study of Sobolev spaces on bundles.</description>

      <title>Vortex Stretching in the Navier-Stokes Equations and Information Dissipation in Diffusion Models: A Reformulation from a Partial Differential Equation Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new inverse-time formulation of vortex stretching in the Navier-Stokes equations, based on a PDE framework inspired by score-based diffusion models. By absorbing the ill-posed backward Laplacian arising from time reversal into a drift term expressed through a score function, the inverse-time dynamics are formulated in a Lagrangian manner. Using a discrete Lagrangian flow of an axisymmetric vortex-stretching field, the score function is learned with a neural network and employed to construct backward-time particle trajectories. Numerical results demonstrate that information about initial positions is rapidly lost in the compressive direction, whereas it is relatively well preserved in the stretching direction.</description>

Abstract: We consider the damped nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: \begin{align*} \partial_{t}^2u-\Delta u+2\alpha \partial_{t}u+u-|u|^{p-1}u=0, \ &amp; (t,x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d, \end{align*} where $\alpha&gt;0$, $2\leq d\leq 5$ and energy sub-critical exponents $p&gt;2$. In this paper, we prove that any solution which is asymptotic to a superposition of four solitons with exactly one soliton of opposite sign evolves so that the three like-signed solitons spread out in an equilateral-triangle configuration centered at the oppositely signed soliton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish regularity results for minimizers of the energy functional associated with the thin obstacle problem in Orlicz spaces. More precisely, we prove the Lipschitz continuity and the H\"older continuity of the gradient of minimizers. The analysis is based on techniques from De Giorgi's classical regularity theory. As a byproduct of our results, we also provide a characterization of the structure of the nodal sets of the minimizers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of ground states with prescribed mass for the Non-Linear Schr\"odinger energy with combined nonlinearities on $1$ and $2$-periodic metric graphs. This is the natural prosecution of previous studies concerning on the one hand the homogeneous NLS equation on periodic graphs, and on the other hand the NLS equation with combined nonlinearity on noncompact metric graphs with finitely many vertexes and edges. As in the latter case, it turns out that the interplay between different nonlinearities creates new phenomena with respect to the homogenous setting, but, due to the periodicity, in a quite different way; in particular, for $2$-periodic graphs, the so called dimensional crossover occurs.
  As a by-product, we extend existing results for the homogeneous NLS on the square and honeycomb grids to general $2$-periodic graphs. Furthermore, we also improve previous results obtained for the inhomogeneous NLS on noncompact graphs with finitely many vertexes and edges.</description>

      <title>Semigroup Solutions for A Multilayered Filtration System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate solutions to a coupled system of partial differential equations that describe a multilayered filtration system. Namely, we study the interaction of a viscous incompressible flow with bulk poroelasticity, via a poroelastic interface. The configuration consists of two 3D toroidal subdomains connected via a plate interface, which permits elastic deformation and perfusive fluid dynamics. The governing dynamics comprise Stokes equations in the bulk fluid region, Biot's equations in the bulk poroelastic region, and the recent poroplate of Mikeli\'c at the interface. Coupling occurs on the top and lower surfaces of the plate, and involves conservation of mass, stress balance, and a certain slip condition for the fluid free-flow.
  We seek strong (and mild) solutions in the Hilbert space framework via the Lumer-Phillips theorem. The resolvent analysis employs a nonstandard mixed variational formulation which captures the complex, multi-physics coupling at the interface. We explicitly characterize the infinitesimal generator associated to the linear Cauchy problem and establish the generation of a $C_0$-semigroup on a suitably chosen finite-energy space. With the semigroup in hand, we may treat elastic nonlinearities for plate displacements through perturbation theory. These result parallel those for Biot-Stokes filtration systems, and complement the recently established weak solution theory for multilayer filtrations. The agency of the semigroup straightforwardly admits structural (plate) nonlinearity into the dynamics. Future stability and regularity analyses for multilayer filtrations are also made possible by these results, as well as a comparison of spectral and regularity properties between filtration configurations, and the elucidation of the mitigating poroplate dynamics as possibly regularizing and stabilizing.</description>

      <title>Existence of pure capillary solitary waves in constant vorticity flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of pure capillary solitary waves for the 2D finite-depth Euler equations with nonzero constant vorticity. In the irrotational case, nonexistence of solitary waves was established by Ifrim--Pineau--Tataru--Taylor, so our theorem isolates constant vorticity as a mechanism that enables solitary waves in the pure-capillary regime. The proof uses a spatial-dynamics Hamiltonian formulation of the travelling-wave equations and a nonlinear change of variables that flattens the free surface while putting the symplectic form into Darboux coordinates. Near a distinguished curve in the vorticity--capillarity parameter space, the linearization has a two-dimensional center subspace; a parameter-dependent center-manifold reduction yields a canonical planar Hamiltonian system. A cubic normal-form expansion and long-wave scaling produce a KdV-type profile equation with a reversible homoclinic orbit, which persists under the full dynamics and generates the solitary-wave solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of travelling and stationary front and pulse solutions in a class of degenerate reaction-diffusion systems. We characterise the essential spectrum of the linearised operator in full generality and identify conditions under which it lies entirely in the left-half plane. For a number of special cases we obtain analytical results, including explicit Evans functions, and complete spectral descriptions for certain stationary waves. In regimes where analytical methods are not available, we compute the point spectrum numerically using a Riccati-Evans function approach. Our results show that stable travelling fronts can occur, while travelling pulses are typically unstable.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Traffic Wave of Linear Adaptive Cruise Control: A Second-order Macroscopic Traffic Flow Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic waves, the spatiotemporal propagation of congestion, are a key feature of traffic flow. As Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems gain widespread adoption and show promise for improving both efficiency and safety, understanding how these waves evolve under ACC becomes increasingly important. Yet most existing analyses rely on steady-state metrics (e.g., equilibrium spacing) and neglect the ACC control-law parameters, such as feedback gains, that fundamentally shape higher-order traffic dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we embed the ACC control law directly into the momentum equation while retaining mass conservation law. The result is a higher-order macroscopic model whose dynamics are governed by a second-order partial differential equation equivalent to the linear ACC feedback law. Analyzing the flux Jacobian confirms that the system is strictly hyperbolic, thereby preserving anisotropy and ensuring physical consistency. The derivation also shows that traffic wave evolution depends on both the initial state and the ACC control parameters. We analyze wave-propagation characteristics, linear degeneracy, admissible discontinuities, and their connection to ACC string stability, with the corresponding derivations. Numerical experiments confirm that the second-order model yields markedly lower vehicle-pair speed deviations along wave paths than a first-order model subject to the same non-steady disturbances, underscoring both the necessity of a second-order treatment and the soundness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Regularization for Multi-Phase 2D Euler Equations via Competing Transport Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization framework for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation that exactly preserves the transport structure of multi-phase vorticity fields. The key step is a reformulation of multi-phase vortex patch data in terms of a finite family of passively advected scalar marker functions: at each point, the local vorticity is determined by a smooth, pointwise selection rule arising from competition among these markers. The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism. As the sharpness parameter $\beta\to\infty$, we prove uniform convergence of the transported marker functions on finite time intervals. Moreover, under a geometric nondegeneracy condition on the underlying Euler interface network, we establish Hausdorff convergence of the evolving interfacial structures and exponential-in-$\beta$ pointwise convergence of the regularized vorticity away from the tie sets to the corresponding sharp multi-phase vortex patch solution. Finally, we show that the loss of pointwise convergence coincides precisely with the onset of geometric degeneracy in the Euler interface dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gradient Existence and Energy Finiteness of Local Minimizers in the Wasserstein $L^\infty$ Topology for Binary-Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we refine and complement McCann's results on binary-star systems \cite{McC06}, a compressible fluid model governed by the Euler-Poisson equations. We consider a general form of the equation of state that includes polytropic gaseous stars indexed by $\gamma$ as a special case. Beyond revisiting McCann's framework and conclusions -- where solutions to the Euler-Poisson equations are obtained as local energy minimizers via variational methods under the topology induced by the Wasserstein $L^\infty$ distance -- we focus on a detailed exploration of the properties of local energy minimizers in this topology, addressing three key aspects: (1) the feasibility of transitioning from the Euler-Lagrange equation to the Euler-Poisson equation by demonstrating gradient existence; (2) the existence of $L^\infty$ functions within neighborhoods in this topology; and (3) the finiteness of the energy of local minimizers in this topology, contrasted with the non-existence of finite-energy local minimizers and the existence of infinite-energy weak local minimizers in the topology inherited from topological vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Blow-up suppression for the nematic liquid crystal flow via Couette flow on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well known, for the harmonic heat flow or liquid crystal flow in two-dimension, the solution may blow up when the initial energy is greater than $8\pi$. Motivated by Lai--Lin--Wang--Wei--Zhou (CPAM, 2022), where singular solutions were constructed in the presence of small-scale velocity fields, it is natural to ask whether large-scale velocities may play a stabilizing role, preventing the concentration of blow-up. Here we show that the blow-up phenomenon can be suppressed by a Couette flow whose amplitude is large enough under a weak assumption on the anisotropic norm of the initial data. In particular, we construct examples with initial energy exceeding $8\pi$ that satisfy our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Constant potentials do not minimize the fundamental gap on convex domains in negatively curved Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every negatively curved Hadamard manifold $X$ and every $D &gt; 0$ there exists a convex domain $\Omega \subseteq X$ with diameter $D$ and a convex potential $V$ on $\Omega$ such that the fundamental gap of the operator $-\Delta+V$ is strictly smaller than the fundamental gap of $-\Delta$. This shows that the second part of the fundamental gap conjecture is wrong in every negatively curved manifold. This is significantly harder than in the previously known case of hyperbolic space because, due to the lack of symmetry, one has to study a true PDE, and not just an ODE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetrization of a one-velocity two-pressures Baer-Nunziato type model for mixtures of barotropic compressible fluids. It allows us to justify the zero compaction viscosity limit and to recover a solution of the so-called Kapila model. On the other hand, the symmetrization highlights a pressure-induced stabilization mechanism which allows us to recover a global-in-time existence result for initial data close to constant states.</description>

      <title>Local bounds for nonlinear higher-order vector fields for the p-Laplace equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study higher regularity for weak solutions of the $p$-Laplace equation $-\Delta_p u = f$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ for $p$ sufficiently close to 2. For $m \ge 3$, assuming that $f$ satisfies suitable Sobolev and H\"older regularity conditions, we prove that the nonlinear quantity $|\nabla u|^{m-2}\nabla u$ belongs to $W^{m-1,q}_{{loc}}(\Omega)$, and that $|\nabla u|^{m-2} D^2u$ belongs to $W^{m-2,q}_{{loc}}(\Omega)$, for any $q\ge 2$. Furthermore, we obtain uniform $L^\infty$ bounds for the weighted $(m-1)$-th derivatives of $|\nabla u|^{m-2}\nabla u$ and $|\nabla u|^{m-2} D^2u$, providing quantitative control even near critical points of $\nabla u$.</description>

      <title>Low Mach number limit and optimal time decay rates of the compressible Navier-Stokes-transport system in critical Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Navier-Stokes-Transport (NST) system in the framework of Besov spaces. This system contains of a compressible Navier-Stokes system for the density and momentum of a fluid, and a transport equation for the potential temperature of the fluid. In stark contrast to the well-known Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) system where the temperature satisfies a parabolic type equation providing dissipative effect for the temperature and the density, the temperature in our NST system enjoys a transport equation which precludes a dissipative mechanism for the density, leading to significant different effects to the whole system. We first establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions to the compressible NST system in critical Besov spaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. Furthermore, by introducing the Mach number $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we rigorously prove the low Mach number limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$, showing that the solutions converge to that of the incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system. This singular limit holds globally in time, even for {\it ill-prepared} initial data. To address the challenge posed by the lack of dissipation on the density and temperature, we develop a refined energy analysis and establish optimal time decay rates for strong solutions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 3$. Notably, the density remains uniformly bounded in time, displaying asymptotic behavior fundamentally distinct from that in the NSF system, where the density possesses a dissipative structure via the momentum and temperature equations and exhibits temporal decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of mixed local-nonlocal equations with Hartree-type nonlinearities of the form \begin{equation}\label{meqnab} -\Delta u + (-\Delta)^s u + u = (I_\alpha * F(u))\,F'(u) \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation} where $N \geq 3$, $s \in (0,1)$, and $F \in C^1(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ satisfies Berestycki-Lions type assumptions. The equation combines the classical Laplacian with the fractional Laplacian, while the Hartree-type nonlinearity is given by a nonlocal convolution term involving the Riesz potential $I_\alpha$, with $\alpha \in (0,N)$. We prove the existence of ground state solutions. To this end, we establish regularity properties and derive a Poho\v{z}aev-type identity for general weak solutions. Moreover, we obtain symmetry properties of ground state solutions via polarization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider homogeneous $\Delta_H$-harmonic polynomials on the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb H$ and their traces on the unit sphere $S_\rho$ associated with the Kor\'anyi--Folland homogeneous norm $\rho$. We prove that $L^2(S_\rho,\sigma)$ decomposes as the orthogonal Hilbert direct sum of finite-dimensional spaces $H_m(S_\rho)$ of spherical harmonics of degree $m$, in direct analogy with the classical Euclidean spherical harmonic decomposition. We also show that, for the polynomial gauge $\eta_+^2(z,t)=|z|^2+4t$, every homogeneous polynomial on $\mathbb H$ admits a unique decomposition $$ P_m(\mathbb H) = H_m(\mathbb H)\oplus \eta_+^2 P_{m-2}(\mathbb H). $$ Finally, we extend the spherical $L^2$-decomposition to general Carnot groups $G$ equipped with a canonical homogeneous norm $N$ associated with a fundamental solution of a fixed sub-Laplacian $\Delta_G$. The traces on $S_N$ of homogeneous $\Delta_G$-harmonic polynomials of degree $m$ form pairwise orthogonal eigenspaces of the spherical operator on $S_N$, and their span is dense in $L^2(S_N,\sigma_N)$.</description>

Abstract: Data assimilation plays a crucial role in modern weather prediction, providing a systematic way to incorporate observational data into complex dynamical models. The paper addresses continuous data assimilation for a model arising as a singular limit of the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with rotation driven by temperature gradient. The limit system preserves the essential physical mechanisms of the original model, while exhibiting a reduced, effectively two-and-a-half-dimensional structure. This simplified framework allows for a rigorous analytical study of the data assimilation process while maintaining a direct physical connection to the full compressible model. We establish well posedness of global-in-time solutions and a compact trajectory attractor, followed by the stability and convergence results for the nudging scheme applied to the limiting system. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be combined with a relative entropy argument to extend the assimilation framework to the full three-dimensional compressible setting, thereby establishing a rigorous connection between the reduced and physically complete models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming $A$ has maximal $L^p$-regularity, this paper investigates perturbations of $A$ by time-dependent operators $B$ that are unbounded and satisfy a critical $L^q$-integrability condition in time. We establish two main results. The first proves maximal $L^p$-regularity for the critical endpoint case, generalizing previous work by Pr\"uss and Schnaubelt (2001). The second develops a weighted maximal regularity theory for mixed-scale perturbations, motivated by the linearized skeleton equations appearing in large deviations theory for stochastic PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a two-dimensional Keller-Segel type system with signal-dependent sensitivity from a stochastic interacting particle model. By employing suitably defined stopping times, we prove that the convergence of the interacting particle system towards the corresponding mean-field limit equations in probability under an algebraic scaling regime which improves upon existing results with logarithmic scaling. Building on this, we apply the relative-entropy method to obtain strong $L^1$ propagation of chaos, and establish an algebraic convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Local Exponential Stability of Mean-Field Langevin Descent-Ascent in Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean-field Langevin descent-ascent (MFL-DA), a coupled optimization dynamics on the space of probability measures for entropically regularized two-player zero-sum games. Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge.</description>

      <title>On the Numerical Treatment of an Abstract Nonlinear System of Coupled Hyperbolic Equations Associated with the Timoshenko Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a least-squares splitting method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the theoretical convergence of the nonlinear least-squares splitting method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation in which each iteration decouples the pointwise nonlinearity from the differential operator and consists of a local nonlinear update followed by the solution of two sequential Poisson-type elliptic problems. While the method performs well in computations, a rigorous convergence theory has remained unavailable. We observe that the iteration admits a reformulation as an alternating-projection scheme on Sobolev spaces $H^m$, $m\ge 0$. At a solution, the G\^ateaux differentials of the projection maps are the linear projections onto the corresponding tangent spaces. We prove that these tangent spaces are transverse, and hence the linearization of the alternating-projection map is a contraction by classical Hilbert-space theory for alternating projections. Building on this geometric characterization, we prove linear convergence in $H^2$ of the splitting method on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ for initial data sufficiently close to a solution $u\in H^4$. To the best of our knowledge, this yields the first rigorous convergence result for this splitting method in the periodic setting and provides a functional-analytic explanation for its observed numerical robustness.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric L\'evy walks driven by convex combination of fractional material derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a class of linear partial differential equations that arise as deterministic descriptions of the scaling limits of L\'evy walks, in which transport is driven by a convex combination of fractional material derivatives and a source term. Using techniques of Fourier-Laplace transforms, we first prove the existence of mild solutions for continuous initial data. Using a recently obtained pointwise representation of the fractional material derivative, we then identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the source term that guaranties the solution to remain a probability density for all times (non-negativity and unit mass). Motivated by the need to preserve these probabilistic properties in computations, we construct a finite-volume discretization that is probability conservative by construction. We establish discrete stability and a convergence result for the continuous weak solution as space and time steps tend to zero. Extensive numerical experiments validate the scheme: total mass is conserved, non-negativity is maintained, and the computed solutions reproduce the known analytic representations of the probability density functions associated with the L\'evy walk process. The combined theoretical and numerical framework provides a reliable tool for studying anomalous transport governed by fractional dynamics.</description>

      <title>A new Energy Equation Derivation for the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) are extensions to the well-known Shallow Water Equations (SWE) for the efficient modeling and numerical simulation of free-surface flows. While the SWE typically assume a depth-averaged vertical velocity profile, the SWME allow for vertical variations of the velocity profile. The SWME therefore assume a polynomial profile and then derive additional evolution equations for the polynomial coefficients via higher order depth integration. In this work, we perform a new systematic derivation of the energy equation for a specific variant of the SWME, called the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME). The derivation is based on the standard SWE energy equation derivation and includes the skew-symmetric formulation of the model. The new systematic derivation is beneficial for the extension to other SWME variants and their numerical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For relatively form-compact perturbations of non-negative selfadjoint operators, we obtain an upper bound on the number of discrete eigenvalues in half-planes separated from the positive real axis. The bound is given in terms of a partial trace of the real part of the Birman--Schwinger operator, or an appropriate rotation thereof. As an application to Schr\"odinger operators, we generalise the Cwikel--Lieb--Rozenblum inequality to complex potentials and derive new Lieb--Thirring type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities for spheres and plane domains revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: M.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N.~Nadirashvili [Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48] and T.~Hoff\-mann-Ostenhof, P.~Michor, and N.~Nadirashvili [Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188]. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In the first paper, $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the second, $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in these papers are not very detailed. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. We provide a survey of previous results (Chap.~1), as well as proofs of prerequisite theorems (Chap.~2). When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof of the upper bound, $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some eigenfunctions (Chap.~3). When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider the three boundary conditions, Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains. More precisely, we prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$ (Chap.~4). We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected (Chap.~5). These chapters rely on Euler's inequality applied to the nodal graph and a careful analysis of eigenfunctions which optimize Euler's inequality. Chap.~6 contains related results (nodal line conjecture; Courant-sharp eigenvalues).</description>

      <title>From Volterra dislocations to strain-gradient plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a strain-gradient model of plasticity as a $\Gamma$-limit of continuum bodies containing finitely-many edge-dislocations (in two dimensions). The key difference from previous such derivations is the elemental notion of a dislocation: we work in a continuum framework in which the lattice structure is represented by a smooth frame field, and the presence of a dislocation manifests in a circulation condition on that frame field; the resulting model is a Lagrangian approach with a multiplicative strain decomposition. The multiplicative nature of the geometric incompatibility generates many technical challenges, which require a systematic study of the geometry of bodies containing multiple dislocations, the definition of new notions of convergence, and the derivation of new geometric rigidity estimates pertinent to dislocated bodies. Our approach places the strain-gradient limit in a unified framework with other models of dislocations, which cannot be addressed within the "admissible strain" approach used in previous works.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present counterexamples to maximal $L^p$-regularity for a parabolic PDE. The example is a second-order operator in divergence form with space and time-dependent coefficients. It is well-known from Lions' theory that such operators admit maximal $L^2$-regularity on $H^{-1}$ under a coercivity condition on the coefficients, and without any regularity conditions in time and space. We show that in general one cannot expect maximal $L^p$-regularity on $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ or $L^2$-regularity on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

Abstract: We study an inverse resonance problem on the line in which we aim at determining a compactly supported and integrable perturbation of a fixed P\"oschl-Teller potential. We define the resonances as the poles of the reflection coefficients with a negative imaginary part. Given the zeros and the poles of one of the reflection coefficients, we are able to determine uniquely the perturbation of a P\"oschl-Teller potential when its support is to the left or to the right of zero on the line and also in the remaining cases under the addition of other hypothesis or extra spectral data. We also give asymptotics of the resonances and show that they are asymptotically located on two logarithmic branches.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions to the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. These solutions, which exist on a nonzero constant background $k$, are unique up to translation for each permissible value of $k$ and wave speed. By leveraging the Hamiltonian nature of the modified Camassa-Holm equation and employing three conserved functionals-comprising an energy and two Casimirs, we establish orbital stability through an analysis of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition. This stability pertains to perturbations of the momentum variable in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00708v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the radial symmetry, uniqueness and non-degeneracy of solutions to the degenerate nonlinear elliptic equation $$ -\nabla \cdot \left(|x|^{2a} \nabla u\right) + \omega u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \R^d, $$ where $d \geq 2$, $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;0$ and $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2d}{d-2(1-a)}$. We proved that any ground state is radially symmetric and strictly decreasing in the radial direction. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of ground states and derive the non-degeneracy of ground states in the corresponding radially symmetric Sobolev space. This affirms the natural conjectures posed recently in \cite{IS}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the damped nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: \begin{align*} \partial_{t}^2u-\Delta u+2\alpha \partial_{t}u+u-|u|^{p-1}u=0, \ &amp; (t,x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d, \end{align*} where $\alpha&gt;0$, $1\leq d\leq 5$ and energy sub-critical exponents $p&gt;2$. In this paper, we prove that 3-solitary waves behave as if the three solitons are on a line. Furthermore, the solitary waves have alternative signs and their distances are of order $\log{t}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum field theory for a scalar model of the electromagnetic field interacting with a system of two-level atoms. In this setting, we show that it is possible to uniquely determine the density of atoms from measurements of the source to solution map for a system of nonlocal partial differential equations, which describe the scattering of a two-photon state from the atoms. The required measurements involve correlating the outputs of a point detector with an integrating detector, thereby exploiting information about the entanglement of the photons.</description>

      <title>Fractional Infinity Laplacian with Obstacle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the obstacle problem for the fractional infinity Laplacian with nonhomogeneous term $f(u)$, where $f:\mathbb{R}^+ \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$: $$\begin{cases} L[u]=f(u) &amp;\qquad in \{u&gt;0\}\\ u \geq 0 &amp;\qquad in\, \Omega\\ u=g &amp;\qquad on\, \partial \Omega\end{cases},$$ with $$L[u](x)=\sup_{y\in \Omega,\,y\neq x}\dfrac{u(y)-u(x)}{|y-x|^{\alpha}}+\inf_{y\in \Omega,\,y\neq x} \dfrac{u(y)-u(x)}{|y-x|^\alpha},\qquad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1.$$ Under the assumptions that $f$ is a continuous and monotone function and that the boundary datum $g$ is in $C^{0,\beta}(\partial\Omega)$ for some $0&lt;\beta&lt;\alpha$, we prove existence of a solution $u$ to this problem. Moreover, this solution $u$ is $\beta-$H\"olderian on $\overline{\Omega}$. Our proof is based on an approximation of $f$ by an appropriate sequence of functions $f_\varepsilon$ where we prove using Perron's method the existence of solutions $u_\varepsilon$, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Then, we show some uniform H\"older estimates on $u_\varepsilon$ that guarantee that $u_\varepsilon \rightarrow u$ where this limit function $u$ turns out to be a solution to our obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Notes on Schauder estimates by scaling for elliptic PDEs in divergence form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are the notes of a part of the PhD course Regularity for free boundary problems and for elliptic PDEs, held in Pavia in the spring of 2025. The aim is to provide a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of classical interior and local Schauder estimates for second-order linear elliptic PDEs in divergence form via scaling in the spirit of Simon's work. The main techniques presented here are geometric in nature and were primarily developed in the study of geometric problems such as minimal surfaces. The adopted approach relies on compactness and blow-up arguments, combined with rigidity results (Liouville theorems), and shares many features with the one used in the study of free boundary problems, which was the main topic of the other part of the PhD course.</description>

      <title>Liouville properties for differential inequalities with $(p,q)$ Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish several Liouville-type theorems for a class of nonhomogenenous quasilinear inequalities. In the first part, we prove various Liouville results associated with nonnegative solutions to \begin{equation*}\tag{$P_s$} -\Delta_p u-\Delta_q u\geq u^{s-1} \, \text{ in }\, \Omega, \end{equation*} where $1&lt;q&lt;p$, $s&gt;1$ and $\Omega$ is any exterior domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, we prove that for $q&lt;N$, inequality $(P_s)$ does not admit any positive solution when $s&lt;q_*$ and $(P_s)$ admits a positive solution if $s&gt;q_*$, where $q_*=\frac{q(N-1)}{N-q}$ is the Serrin exponent for the $q$-Laplacian. Further, we show that when $s=q_*$ and $p&lt;s$ the only nonnegative solution to $(P_s)$ is the trivial solution. On the other hand, for $q\geq N$ we prove that $u\equiv 0$ is the only nonnegative solution for $(P_s)$ for any $s&gt;1$.
  In the second part, we consider the inequality \begin{equation*}\tag{$P_{sm}$} -\Delta_p u-\Delta_q u \geq u^s |\nabla u|^m \quad \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation*} where $1&lt;q&lt;p$, $N&gt;q$ and $s, \, m\geq 0$. We prove that, for $\{0\leq m\leq q-1\}\cup\{m&gt;p-1\}$, the only positive solution to $(P_{sm})$ is constant, provided $s(N-q)+m(N-1)&lt;N(q-1)$. This, in particular, proves that if $\Omega=\mathbb{R}^N$ then any nonnegative solution to $(P_s)$ with $1&lt;q&lt;N$ and $1&lt;s&lt;q_*$ is the trivial solution. To prove Liouville in the range $0\leq m&lt;q-1$, we first prove an almost optimal lower estimate of any nonnegative supersolution of $(P_{sm})$ and then leveraging this estimate we prove Liouville result. To the best of our knowledge, this technique is completely new and provides an alternative approach to the capacity method of Mitidieri-Pohozaev provided higher regularity is available.</description>

Abstract: We study large deviations from the invariant measure for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with colored noises on determining modes. The proof is based on a new abstract criterion, inspired by [V. Jak\v{s}i\'{c} et al., Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 68 (2015), 2108-2143]. To address the difficulty caused by fixed squeezing rate, we introduce a bootstrap argument to derive Lipschitz estimates for Feynman-Kac semigroups. This criterion is also applicable to wave equations and Navier-Stokes system.</description>

      <title>Molecular Seeds of Shear: An operator-level necessity result for first-order Chapman-Enskog deviatoric stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new operator-level necessity result for the Chapman--Enskog expansion is established: in closed and unforced kinetic systems, the $O(\varepsilon)$ deviatoric stress arises if and only if the first Chapman--Enskog correction $f^{(1)}$ is nonzero. This resolves a gap in the classical kinetic-to-continuum literature, where the presence of first-order deviatoric stress is typically assumed or derived formally but not shown to be necessary under explicit functional-analytic hypotheses. Under precise nullspace structure, coercivity or quantitative hypocoercivity, and Fredholm solvability of the linearized collision operator--together with uniform $O(\varepsilon^2)$ remainder control--a sharp necessity theorem (Theorem 6.1) is proved: if $f^{(1)}\equiv 0$, then no $O(\varepsilon)$ deviatoric stress can appear in the hydrodynamic limit. The argument identifies the bounded mapping \[ f^{(0)} \mapsto f^{(1)} = -L^{-1}(\partial_t^{(0)} + v \cdot \nabla_x) f^{(0)}, \] and the induced moment-to-stress operator, and shows how remainder bounds preclude hidden $O(\varepsilon)$ contributions. A worked BGK example verifies the construction, transport coefficients, and operator constants. Detailed assumptions and analytic estimates are provided in Section 4 and Appendix A. The discussion concludes by describing how microscopic seeds (deterministic or finite-$N$) can project into macroscopic amplification channels relevant for transition and turbulence.</description>

      <title>Derivation of nonlinear time-dependent macroscopic conductivity for an electropermeabilization model via homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a phenomenological electropermeabilization model in a periodic medium representing biological tissue. Starting from a cell-level model describing the electric potential and the degree of porosity, we perform dimension analysis to identify a relevant scaling in terms of a small parameter $\ve$ - the ratio between the cell and the tissue size. The electric potential satisfies electrostatic equations in the extra- and intracellular domains, while its jump across the cell membrane evolves according to a nonlinear law coupled with an ordinary differential equation for the porosity degree. We prove the well-posedness of the microscopic problem, derive a priori estimates, obtain formal asymptotics, and rigorously justify the expansion combining two-scale convergence with monotonicity arguments. The resulting macroscopic model exhibits memory effects and a nonlinear, time-dependent effective current. It captures the nontrivial evolution of effective conductivity, including a characteristic drop reflecting the capacitive behavior of the lipid bilayer, in agreement with experimental data. Numerical computations of the effective conductivity confirm that, although microscopic conductivity is constant, tissue conductivity varies nonlinearly with electric field strength, showing a sigmoid trend. This suggests a rigorous mathematical explanation for experimentally observed conductivity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the Vacuum Free Boundary Problem for the Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations With Large Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. In particular, physical vacuum, characterized by a moving boundary with nontrivial finite normal acceleration, naturally arises in the motion of shallow water. The corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows remain open, due to the combined difficulties of coordinate singularity at the origin and degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. For a general class of spherically symmetric initial densities: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent), vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. We note that, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, $\rho_0$ contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$, precluding the use of the BD entropy estimate to handle the degeneracy of the shallow water equations ({\it i.e.}, the case $\gamma=2$) on the physical vacuum boundary. Our analysis relies on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, leading to flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; near the boundary, to handle the physical vacuum singularity, we introduce novel $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which are fundamentally different from the classical BD entropy estimate. Together, these estimates yield the desired global regularities.</description>

Abstract: We extend earlier results of Azzam on the dimension drop of the harmonic measure for a domain $\Omega\subset \R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$, with dimensional Ahlfors regular boundary $\partial\Omega$ of dimension $s$ with $n-1-\delta_0 \leq s\leq n-1$, that is uniformly non flat. Here $\delta_0$ is a small positive constant dependent on the parameters of the problem. Our novel construction relies on elementary geometric and potential theoretic considerations. We avoid the use of Riesz transforms and compactness arguments, and also give quantitative bounds on the $\delta_0$ parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability of the cosmological region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, we show that solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant arising from data on a cylinder that is uniformly close to the Kerr de Sitter geometry (with possibly different mass and angular momentum parameters at either end) are future geodesically complete and display asymptotically de Sitter-like degrees of freedom. The proof uses an ADM formulation of the Einstein equations in parabolic gauge. Together with a well-known theorem of Hintz-Vasy [Acta Math. 220 (2018)], our result yields a global stability result for Kerr de Sitter from Cauchy data on a spacelike hypersurface bridging two black hole exteriors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the neutral inclusion problem with imperfect boundary conditions, focusing on designing interface functions for inclusions of arbitrary shapes. Traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) struggle with this inverse problem, leading to the development of Conformal Mapping Coordinates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CoCo-PINNs), which integrate geometric function theory with PINNs. CoCo-PINNs effectively solve forward-inverse problems by modeling the interface function through neural network training, which yields a neutral inclusion effect. This approach enhances the performance of PINNs in terms of credibility, consistency, and stability.</description>

Abstract: We establish the exact quenched asymptotic growth of the solution to the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) in the hyperbolic space with a regular, stationary, time-independent Gaussian potential. More precisely, we show that with probability one, the solution $u$ to PAM with constant initial data has pointwise growth asymptotics \[ u(t,x)\sim e^{L^{*}t^{5/3}+o(t^{5/3})} \] as $t \rightarrow +\infty$. Both the power $t^{5/3}$ on the exponential and the exact value of $L^*$ are different from their counterparts in the Euclidean situation. They are determined through an explicit optimisation procedure. Our proof relies on certain fine localisation techniques, which also reveals a stronger non-Euclidean localisation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Approximation of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators with $\delta$-interactions supported on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the approximation of a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a singular $\delta$-potential that is formally given by $(i \nabla + A)^2 + Q + \alpha \delta_\Sigma$ by Schr\"odinger operators with regular potentials in the norm resolvent sense. This is done for $\Sigma$ being the finite union of $C^2$-hypersurfaces, for coefficients $A$, $Q$, and $\alpha$ under almost minimal assumptions such that the associated quadratic forms are closed and sectorial, and $Q$ and $\alpha$ are allowed to be complex-valued functions. In particular, $\Sigma$ can be a graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or the boundary of a piecewise $C^2$-domain. Moreover, spectral implications of the mentioned convergence result are discussed.</description>

      <title>Weak Existence and Uniqueness for Super-Brownian Motion with Irregular Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak existence and uniqueness for random field solutions of the one-dimensional SPDE \[ d_tX_t = \frac{1}{2}\Delta X_t +h(X_t)+ \sqrt{X_t}\dot{W}, \quad t\geq 0,\] where $\dot{W}$ is space-time white noise and $h$ is a bounded drift with $h(0)\geq 0$. The proof relies on an extension of the duality relation of the super-Brownian motion, which allows us to treat a broad class of admissible drifts, including functions that are non-Lipschitz or discontinuous at zero. In particular, well-posedness is derived for certain drifts that are H\"older continuous at zero with exponent $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We also allow discontinuous drifts of the form $h(x) = b_0\unicode{x1D7D9}_{x = 0} + b_1\unicode{x1D7D9}_{x&gt;0},$ where $b_0 \geq 0$, $b_1 \in \mathbb{R}$. Additionally, if $h(0)=0$ and the initial condition is continuous and compactly supported, we show that the Lebesgue measure of the non-zero set of $X$ is finite. The proofs are based on duality. We use a log-Laplace equation, which is perturbed by jump noise as the equation for the dual process, and the jumps of the dual process are allowed to take infinite values. We believe that the results for the dual process are also of independent interest. Under suitable assumptions on $h$ we also prove survival of $X$ with positive probability, using rescaling and comparison to the KPP-equation with branching noise.</description>

      <title>Milstein-type Schemes for Hyperbolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\Big[\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big]\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Moreover, root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>
