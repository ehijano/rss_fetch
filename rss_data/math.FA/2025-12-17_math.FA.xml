      <title>New Properties and Refined Bounds for the $q$-Numerical Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates new properties of $q$-numerical ranges for compact normal operators and establishes refined upper bounds for the $q$-numerical radius of Hilbert space operators. We first prove that for a compact normal operator $T$ with $0 \in W_q(T)$, the $q$-numerical range $W_q(T)$ is a closed convex set containing the origin in its interior. We then explore the behavior of $q$-numerical ranges under complex symmetry, deriving inclusion relations between $W_q(T)$ and $W_q(T^*)$ for complex symmetric operators. For hyponormal operators similar to their adjoints, we provide conditions under which $T$ is self-adjoint and $W_q(T)$ is a real interval. We also study the continuity of $q$-numerical ranges under norm convergence and examine the effect of the Aluthge transform on $W_q(T)$. In the second part, we derive several new and sharp upper bounds for the $q$-numerical radius, incorporating the operator norm, numerical radius, transcendental radius, and the infimum of $\|Tx\|$ over the unit sphere. These bounds unify and improve upon existing results in the literature, offering a comprehensive framework for estimating $q$-numerical radii across the entire parameter range $q \in [0,1]$. Each result is illustrated with detailed examples and comparisons with prior work.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Operator Calculus (Part A): Trace-Form Evaluators and Spectral Growth Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a spectral-operator calculus on separable Hilbert space that treats self-adjoint operators and their bounded spectral transforms as the basic objects. On a class of such ``spectral geometries'' we introduce abstract evaluators, required to satisfy natural invariance, locality, extensivity, and dominated-convergence continuity conditions. Our first main result is a trace-form representation theorem: on the natural trace-class envelope every such evaluator is given by the trace of a single nondecreasing profile applied through the functional calculus. Thus, once that profile and a scalar normalization are fixed, all admissible scalar values are determined by the underlying spectra, yielding a rigidity principle for evaluators in this setting. The second main result is a spectral growth taxonomy: we classify self-adjoint operators by counting-function asymptotics and show that the polynomial growth class is stable under the basic constructions of the calculus. Together these results provide an arithmetic-neutral analytic backbone for later parts of the series and for applications to concrete spectral models.</description>

      <title>Fuglede theorem for symmetric spaces of $\tau$-measurable operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Fuglede commutativity theorem to the full scale of symmetrically normed operator ideals. Our main result provides a complete characterization: a symmetric ideal or symmetric operator space of $\tau$-measurable operators satisfies the Fuglede theorem if and only if its commutative core has non-trivial Boyd indices, or equivalently, if it is an interpolation space in the scale of $L_p$-spaces for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. This criterion subsumes all previously known cases, including Lorentz and Schatten classes.</description>

      <title>Condensed mathematics through compactological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their 2022 lecture notes on condensed sets, Clausen and Scholze mentioned in a remark that the important subclass of quasiseparated condensed sets is equivalent to the category of so-called compactological spaces defined by Waelbroeck in the 1960s. In this paper we survey the latter category in detail, we give a rigorous proof of Clausen and Scholze's claim, and we establish that condensed sets are a formal categorical completion of Waelbroeck's compactological spaces. The latter answers a question asked by Hanson in 2023 and permits the interpretation of compactological sets as an 'elementary' approach to condensed mathematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of conditional probability for arbitrary ordered vector spaces. A related problem is that of assigning a numerical value to one vector relative to another.
  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. This leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>

      <title>On fractal minimizers and potentials of occupation measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider four prototypes of variational problems and prove the existence of fractal minimizers through the direct method in the calculus of variations. By design these minimizers are H\"older curves or H\"older parametrizations of hypersurfaces whose images generally have a non-integer Hausdorff dimension. Although their origin is deterministic, their regularity properties are roughly similar to those of typical realizations of stochastic processes. As a key tool, we prove novel continuity and boundedness results for potentials of occupation measures of Gaussian random fields. These results complement well-known results for local times, but hold under much less restrictive assumptions. In an auxiliary section, we generalize earlier results on non-linear compositions of fractional Sobolev functions with $BV$-functions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Lipschitz spaces view of infinitely wide shallow neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the mean field parametrization of shallow neural networks, using signed measures on unbounded parameter spaces and duality pairings that take into account the regularity and growth of activation functions. This setting directly leads to the use of unbalanced Kantorovich-Rubinstein norms defined by duality with Lipschitz functions, and of spaces of measures dual to those of continuous functions with controlled growth. These allow to make transparent the need for total variation and moment bounds or penalization to obtain existence of minimizers of variational formulations, under which we prove a compactness result in strong Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, and in the absence of which we show several examples demonstrating undesirable behavior. Further, the Kantorovich-Rubinstein setting enables us to combine the advantages of a completely linear parametrization and ensuing reproducing kernel Banach space framework with optimal transport insights. We showcase this synergy with representer theorems and uniform large data limits for empirical risk minimization, and in proposed formulations for distillation and fusion applications.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of weight sharply discards Lavrentiev's gap for double phase functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the smoother the weight, the broader the range of exponents for which the Lavrentiev's gap is absent for the double phase functionals, i.e.,
  $u \mapsto \int_{\Omega} \left(|\nabla u|^p + a(x)|\nabla u|^q\right)\,dx\,, \quad 1 \leq p \leq q &lt; \infty,\, a(\cdot) \geq 0\,.$
  In particular, if $a \in C^\infty$, then no additional restrictions are required on $p$ and $q$. For $a \in C^{k, \alpha}$, we establish the optimal range of exponents, which reads $q \leq p + (k + \alpha)\max(1, p/N)$. Thereby, we extend previously known results which consider H\"older continuous $a$ (i.e., $q \leq p + \alpha\max(1, p/N)$), showing that the range of exponents extends naturally upon imposing more regularity on $a$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Banach-bundle germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a continuous bundle $\mathcal{E}\to X$ of Banach/Hilbert spaces or Banach/$C^*$-algebras over a paracompact base space, equivariant for a compact Lie group $\mathbb{U}$ operating on all structures involved. We prove that in all cases homogeneous equivariant subbundles extend equivariantly from $\mathbb{U}$-invariant closed subsets of $X$ to closed invariant neighborhoods thereof (provided the fibers are semisimple in the Banach-algebra variant). This extends a number of results in the literature (due to Fell for non-equivariant local extensibility around a single point for $C^*$-algebras and the author for semisimple Banach algebras). The proofs are based in part on auxiliary results on (a) the extensibility of equivariant compact-Lie-group principal bundles locally around invariant closed subsets of paracompact spaces, as a consequence of equivariant-bundle classifying spaces being absolute neighborhood extensors in the relevant setting and (b) an equivariant-bundle version of Johnson's approximability of almost-multiplicative maps from finite-dimensional semisimple Banach algebras with Banach morphisms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interlacing Families: New Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of generalized interlacing families of polynomials, which extends the classical interlacing polynomial method to handle polynomials of varying degrees. We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.</description>
