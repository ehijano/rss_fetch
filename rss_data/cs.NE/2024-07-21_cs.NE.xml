      <title>The Effect of Training Schedules on Morphological Robustness and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness and generalizability are the key properties of artificial neural network (ANN)-based controllers for maintaining a reliable performance in case of changes. It is demonstrated that exposing the ANNs to variations during training processes can improve their robustness and generalization capabilities. However, the way in which this variation is introduced can have a significant impact. In this paper, we define various training schedules to specify how these variations are introduced during an evolutionary learning process. In particular, we focus on morphological robustness and generalizability concerned with finding an ANN-based controller that can provide sufficient performance on a range of physical variations. Then, we perform an extensive analysis of the effect of these training schedules on morphological generalization. Furthermore, we formalize the process of training sample selection (i.e., morphological variations) to improve generalization as a reinforcement learning problem. Overall, our results provide deeper insights into the role of variability and the ways of enhancing the generalization property of evolved ANN-based controllers.</description>

      <title>SHS: Scorpion Hunting Strategy Swarm Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduced the Scorpion Hunting Strategy (SHS), a novel population-based, nature-inspired optimisation algorithm. This algorithm draws inspiration from the hunting strategy of scorpions, which identify, locate, and capture their prey using the alpha and beta vibration operators. These operators control the SHS algorithm's exploitation and exploration abilities. To formulate an optimisation method, we mathematically simulate these dynamic events and behaviors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the SHS algorithm by employing 20 benchmark functions (including 10 conventional and 10 CEC2020 functions), using both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Through a comparative analysis with 12 state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms, we demonstrate that the proposed SHS algorithm yields exceptionally promising results. These findings are further supported by statistically significant results obtained through the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Additionally, the ranking of SHS, as determined by the average rank derived from the Friedman test, positions it at the forefront when compared to other algorithms. Going beyond theoretical validation, we showcase the practical utility of the SHS algorithm by applying it to six distinct real-world optimisation tasks. These applications illustrate the algorithm's potential in addressing complex optimisation challenges. In summary, this work not only introduces the innovative SHS algorithm but also substantiates its effectiveness and versatility through rigorous benchmarking and real-world problem-solving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Heuristics Can Profit From Global Variation Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Lissovoi, Oliveto, and Warwicker (Artificial Intelligence (2023)) proved that the Move Acceptance Hyper-Heuristic (MAHH) leaves the local optimum of the multimodal CLIFF benchmark with remarkable efficiency. The $O(n^3)$ runtime of the MAHH, for almost all cliff widths $d\ge 2,$ is significantly better than the $\Theta(n^d)$ runtime of simple elitist evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on CLIFF.
  In this work, we first show that this advantage is specific to the CLIFF problem and does not extend to the JUMP benchmark, the most prominent multi-modal benchmark in the theory of randomized search heuristics. We prove that for any choice of the MAHH selection parameter $p$, the expected runtime of the MAHH on a JUMP function with gap size $m = O(n^{1/2})$ is at least $\Omega(n^{2m-1} / (2m-1)!)$. This is significantly slower than the $O(n^m)$ runtime of simple elitist EAs. Encouragingly, we also show that replacing the local one-bit mutation operator in the MAHH with the global bit-wise mutation operator, commonly used in EAs, yields a runtime of $\min\{1, O(\frac{e\ln(n)}{m})^m\} \, O(n^m)$ on JUMP functions. This is at least as good as the runtime of simple elitist EAs. For larger values of $m$, this result proves an asymptotic performance gain over simple EAs. As our proofs reveal, the MAHH profits from its ability to walk through the valley of lower objective values in moderate-size steps, always accepting inferior solutions. This is the first time that such an optimization behavior is proven via mathematical means. Generally, our result shows that combining two ways of coping with local optima, global mutation and accepting inferior solutions, can lead to considerable performance gains.</description>

      <title>Modified-Improved Fitness Dependent Optimizer for Complex and Engineering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitness dependent optimizer (FDO) is considered one of the novel swarm intelligent algorithms. Recently, FDO has been enhanced several times to improve its capability. One of the improvements is called improved FDO (IFDO). However, according to the research findings, the variants of FDO are constrained by two primary limitations that have been identified. Firstly, if the number of agents employed falls below five, it significantly diminishes the algorithm's precision. Secondly, the efficacy of FDO is intricately tied to the quantity of search agents utilized. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a modified version of IFDO, called M-IFDO. The enhancement is conducted by updating the location of the scout bee to the IFDO to move the scout bees to achieve better performance and optimal solutions. More specifically, two parameters in IFDO, which are alignment and cohesion, are removed. Instead, the Lambda parameter is replaced in the place of alignment and cohesion. To verify the performance of the newly introduced algorithm, M-IFDO is tested on 19 basic benchmark functions, 10 IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC-C06 2019), and five real-world problems. M-IFDO is compared against five state-of-the-art algorithms: Improved Fitness Dependent Optimizer (IFDO), Improving Multi-Objective Differential Evolution algorithm (IMODE), Hybrid Sampling Evolution Strategy (HSES), Linear Success-History based Parameter Adaptation for Differential Evolution (LSHADE) and CMA-ES Integrated with an Occasional Restart Strategy and Increasing Population Size and An Iterative Local Search (NBIPOP-aCMAES). The verification criteria are based on how well the algorithm reaches convergence, memory usage, and statistical results. The results show that M-IFDO surpasses its competitors in several cases on the benchmark functions and five real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Latent Evolutionary Optimization for Targeted Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead optimization is a pivotal task in the drug design phase within the drug discovery lifecycle. The primary objective is to refine the lead compound to meet specific molecular properties for progression to the subsequent phase of development. In this work, we present an innovative approach, Latent Evolutionary Optimization for Molecule Generation (LEOMol), a generative modeling framework for the efficient generation of optimized molecules. LEOMol leverages Evolutionary Algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm and Differential Evolution, to search the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). This search facilitates the identification of the target molecule distribution within the latent space. Our approach consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art models across a range of constrained molecule generation tasks, outperforming existing models in all four sub-tasks related to property targeting. Additionally, we suggest the importance of including toxicity in the evaluation of generative models. Furthermore, an ablation study underscores the improvements that our approach provides over gradient-based latent space optimization methods. This underscores the effectiveness and superiority of LEOMol in addressing the inherent challenges in constrained molecule generation while emphasizing its potential to propel advancements in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>LoAS: Fully Temporal-Parallel Datatflow for Dual-Sparse Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.</description>

      <title>Evolving generalist controllers to handle a wide range of morphological variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuro-evolutionary methods have proven effective in addressing a wide range of tasks. However, the study of the robustness and generalizability of evolved artificial neural networks (ANNs) has remained limited. This has immense implications in the fields like robotics where such controllers are used in control tasks. Unexpected morphological or environmental changes during operation can risk failure if the ANN controllers are unable to handle these changes. This paper proposes an algorithm that aims to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the controllers. This is achieved by introducing morphological variations during the evolutionary training process. As a results, it is possible to discover generalist controllers that can handle a wide range of morphological variations sufficiently without the need of the information regarding their morphologies or adaptation of their parameters. We perform an extensive experimental analysis on simulation that demonstrates the trade-off between specialist and generalist controllers. The results show that generalists are able to control a range of morphological variations with a cost of underperforming on a specific morphology relative to a specialist. This research contributes to the field by addressing the limited understanding of robustness and generalizability and proposes a method by which to improve these properties.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-parent crossover operator in genetic algorithms (GAs) called ``Deep Neural Crossover'' (DNC). Unlike conventional GA crossover operators that rely on a random selection of parental genes, DNC leverages the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an encoder-decoder architecture to select the genes. Specifically, we use DRL to learn a policy for selecting promising genes. The policy is stochastic, to maintain the stochastic nature of GAs, representing a distribution for selecting genes with a higher probability of improving fitness. Our architecture features a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the parental genomes into latent memory states, and a decoder RNN that utilizes an attention-based pointing mechanism to generate a distribution over the next selected gene in the offspring. To improve the training time, we present a pre-training approach, wherein the architecture is initially trained on a single problem within a specific domain and then applied to solving other problems of the same domain. We compare DNC to known operators from the literature over two benchmark domains -- bin packing and graph coloring. We compare with both two- and three-parent crossover, outperforming all baselines. DNC is domain-independent and can be easily applied to other problem domains.</description>

      <title>Multi-Texture Synthesis through Signal Responsive Neural Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have proven to be effective in a variety of fields, with numerous biologically inspired applications. One of the fields, in which NCAs perform well is the generation of textures, modelling global patterns from local interactions governed by uniform and coherent rules. This paper aims to enhance the usability of NCAs in texture synthesis by addressing a shortcoming of current NCA architectures for texture generation, which requires separately trained NCA for each individual texture. In this work, we train a single NCA for the evolution of multiple textures, based on individual examples. Our solution provides texture information in the state of each cell, in the form of an internally coded genomic signal, which enables the NCA to generate the expected texture. Such a neural cellular automaton not only maintains its regenerative capability but also allows for interpolation between learned textures and supports grafting techniques. This demonstrates the ability to edit generated textures and the potential for them to merge and coexist within the same automaton. We also address questions related to the influence of the genomic information and the cost function on the evolution of the NCA.</description>

      <title>E(n) Equivariant Topological Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.</description>
