      <title>13 or 14, Halloween surprise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss here the history of the rhombocuboctahedron and pseudorombocuboctahedron and describe the structure of their paper models. It turns out that one of them serves as an excellent basis for creating a Jack-o'-lantern. The note is written primarily for school students.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Measure and Dimension with Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document offers a concise introduction to the mathematical theory and practical application of the Hausdorff Measure and Dimension. The primary objective is to clarify and rigorously detail the two most common methods used for calculating the dimension of a set, ensuring all calculation details are transparent for the reader.
  The paper first establishes the theoretical groundwork by reviewing the definitions of the Hausdorff measure, proving the dimensional invariance under changes to the shape of the covering sets, and confirming the dimensional property of open sets. It then introduces the two main methodologies.
  The first is the Lower and Upper Bound Estimation, which uses the relationship between the measure $H^s(A)$ and the dimension $\dim_{H}(A)$. This method emphasizes the use of the Mass Distribution Principle for establishing the lower bound, which is essential when the Lebesgue measure of the set is zero. The second, more computationally efficient method is the Similarity Dimension Method, introduced via the definitions of Similitudes, Iterated Function Systems (IFS), and the Moran-Hutchinson Theorem.
  Both methodologies are applied rigorously to classic examples: the Unit Square (yielding dimension $2$) and the Cantor Set (yielding the fractional dimension $\log 2 / \log 3$). The paper serves as a detailed, step-by-step guide intended to make the application of these fundamental fractal geometry concepts clearer and easier to understand.</description>

      <title>Curve Stitching and Dancing Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curve stitching is a classic educational activity where one constructs elegant curves from a family of straight lines. We perform curve stitching around a circle to make a modular stitch graph. Take $m$ points equally spaced around a circle, choose an integer multiplier $a$, and draw a chord from point $p$ to $a p \mod m$. What design will appear as the envelope of these chords? We connect these discrete objects to a continuous-time dynamical system and apply a topological perspective to understand the answer to this question.</description>

      <title>The mathematics of periodic anthyphairesis as a basis for the full understanding of Plato's philosophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though Plato's philosophy in ancient times was always closely associated with mathematics, modern Platonic scholarship, during the last five centuries, has moved steadily toward de-mathematization. The present work aims to outline a radical re-interpretation of Plato's philosophy, according to which the Platonic Idea, that is, the intelligible Being, has the structure of the philosophical analogue of a geometric dyad in a philosophic anthyphaeresis -- the precursor of modern continued fractions -- which was studied by the Pythagoreans, Theodorus and Theaetetus in relation with the discoveries of quadratic incommensurabilities. This mathematical structure is clearly visible in the Platonic method of Division and Collection, equivalently Name and Logos, equivalently True Opinion plus Logos, in the dialogues Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Meno, and Parmenides. Equipped with this structure of an intelligible Being, we provide definitive answers to fundamental questions, that were not be resolved by Platonists, concerning the following topics: the dialectic numbers, which are based on the anthyphairetic periodicity and the plus one rule, stating that the dialectic number of terms of a sequence is the (number of) ratios of successive terms plus one (stated in the Parmenides 148d-149d); the description of the intelligible being as an Indivisible Line, a statement bordering on the contradictory; the also seemingly contradictory Sophist 's statement that ``the not-Being is a Being'', based on the equalization of the two elements of the dyad defining an intelligible Being; the more general self-similar Oneness of an intelligible Being, based on the equalization of all parts generated by the anthyphairetic division of an intelligible Being; and finally the Third Man Argument in the Introduction to the Parmenides, appearing as a threat for Plato's theory, but essentially innocuous because of the self-similar Oneness. The third part of our study aims to prove that, contrary to the presently dominant interpretation of Zeno's arguments and paradoxes as being devoid of mathematical content, the analysis of Zeno's presence in the Parmenides, Sophist (via the Eleatic Stranger), and Zeno's verbatim Fragments preserved by Simplicius, show that Plato's intelligible Beings essentially coincide with Zeno's true Beings, and hence that Zeno's philosophical thought was already anthyphairetic, and hence heavily influenced by the Pythagorean's Mathematics. These findings run against Burkert's claim that ``ontology is prior to mathematics''. Modern Platonists have never obtained a clear description of the structure of an intelligible Idea in terms of the mathematics of periodic anthyphairesis, and thus were not able to answer fundamental questions, nor to realize the close connection of Zeno's intelligible beings with Zeno's true Beings.</description>

      <title>Zygmunt Janiszewski Mathematical Publications During His Engagement in Poland Struggle for National Independence in World War I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the mathematical publications of Zygmunt Janiszewski (1888-1920), a major figure in Polish science at the beginning of the twentieth century. Serving in the Polish Legion between 1914 and 1920 in the struggle for national independence, Janiszewski was not only one of the founders of the Polish School of Mathematics, but also the initiator of the creation of Fundamenta Mathematicae, the world's first specialized scientific journal devoted exclusively to pure mathematics.
The aim of this study is to reconstruct, as far as the available sources allow, the circumstances and conditions under which Janiszewski published his mathematical works. Through this analysis, we highlight the significance of his research in the broader process of structuring and consolidating the modern Polish mathematical community.</description>
