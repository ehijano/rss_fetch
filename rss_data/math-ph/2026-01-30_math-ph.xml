      <title>Vanishing of power-law corrections to Kubo's formula for the Hall current at incommensurate magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-interacting electron gas confined to a two-dimensional crystal by the action of a perpendicular magnetic field; in the one-particle approximation, the dynamics of the system is modelled by a spectrally gapped Bloch-Landau Hamiltonian. No commensurability condition is assumed between the magnetic flux per unit cell and the quantum of magnetic flux. We construct a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state (NEASS) which "dresses" the equilibrium Fermi projection on states below the spectral gap, and models the state of the system after the addition of a weak external electric field of strength $\varepsilon \ll 1$. Having in mind applications to the integer quantum Hall effect, we probe the response of a current operator in the direction transverse to that of the applied electric field, and show that the resulting current density in the NEASS is linear in $\varepsilon$, with no power-law corrections. The linear response coefficient, namely the Hall conductivity, is computed in terms of the equilibrium Fermi projection via the double-commutator formula, in accordance with the prediction from Kubo's linear response theory.
  Our results generalize the methods and findings of [Lett. Math. Phys. 112 (2022), 91] to the setting of uniform magnetic fields with incommensurate magnetic flux per unit cell, and to lattice-periodic perturbation of such magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Rigid Body Rotors in Planar Potentials: A Novel type of Superintegrable Mechanical Systems in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superintegrability of rigid body rotors coupled to planar systems. In particular, we study the isotropic harmonic oscillator in two dimensions, with its (central) force acting on the rotor's center of mass constrained to move in the plane. By including an internal rotational degree of freedom described by a rigid rotor, the resulting planar system possesses three degrees of freedom: two translational and one rotational. When the orbital motion and the internal rotation are tuned to resonance, additional integrals of motion arise, extending the hidden symmetry algebras of the underlying models. For the oscillator, the well-known $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ symmetry algebra can be enlarged by the presence of the rotor, with the conserved momentum $p_{\theta}$ reasonably playing the role of a deformation parameter. These algebraic structures remain to be properly understood, and we hope that this short letter will serve as an invitation to further investigate these interesting models. To close the work, we also examine the oscillator in a vertical plane, in the presence of a rotor, under the effect of a uniform gravitational field, showing that the algebraic structure persists as a translated version of the isotropic case, as expected. In all these settings, the extended dynamics admits five functionally independent integrals, thereby confirming maximal superintegrability. Our simple yet nontrivial results suggest that rigid-body rotors provide a natural mechanism for generating new families of (resonant) superintegrable systems, along with their associated symmetry algebras, an outcome that aligns with the main objective of this work.</description>

      <title>Generalized forms of types N = 1, 2 and higher gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified formulation for higher gauge theory using generalized forms, encompassing higher connections, curvatures, and gauge transformations. We begin by developing the calculus of generalized forms valued in higher algebras and groups, including the associated higher Maurer--Cartan forms and equations. Using generalized forms of types N = 1, 2, we then provide a complete description of higher gauge structures. Finally, we derive the action functionals for higher Chern--Simons and Yang--Mills theories as applications of the formalism.</description>

      <title>Anomalous (3+1)d Fermionic Topological Quantum Field Theories via Symmetry Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Single-Nodal Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in NLP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.</description>

      <title>Quiver-Invariant Dualities between Brane Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pairs of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that share the same vacuum moduli space and the same chiral field content, encoded by a common quiver, but differ in their superpotentials. These theories arise as worldvolume theories on a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold and admit a description in terms of bipartite graphs on a 2-torus, known as brane tilings. Using an explicit example, we show that the correspondence is realized by a single `tilting' mutation along the diagonals of hexagonal faces in the brane tiling, which is equivalent to a specific sequence of Seiberg dualities performed at distinct gauge nodes in the quiver.</description>

      <title>The Tensionless Lives of Null Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensionless limit probes the very high energy regime of string theory in contrast to the well studied point-particle limit which reduces to Einstein gravity. Tensionless strings sweep out null worldsheets in the target space and hence are also called null strings. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of tensionless null string theory beginning with the initial work of Schild, and continuing to the foundational work of Isberg et al (ILST) and then focussing on developments in the past decade.
  Recent work centres on the emergence of the Carrollian Conformal Algebra as residual worldsheet symmetries of the ILST action and the identification of tensionless limit as a worldsheet Carrollian limit on the string worldsheet. Carrollian structures are used to address the classical and quantum aspects of the null string. In the classical theory, the aforementioned limit agrees with the analysis from the ILST action. Symmetries, constraints, mode expansions computed from both perspectives match nicely providing a robust cross-check of the analyses. We discuss closed and open null strings as well as their supersymmetric cousins.
  The quantum null string comes with several surprises, the foremost of which is the emergence of three consistent quantum theories from the ILST action. We detail the canonical quantisation and the spectrum of the triumvirate of theories. We discuss the novelties of the quantum null theories and the effect compactifaction has on them. We also discuss Carroll strings, applications of these ideas to strings approaching black holes and give a quick overview of other related developments.</description>

      <title>On the Integrable Structure of the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.</description>

      <title>Parametric Hyperbolic Conservation Laws: A Unified Framework for Conservation, Entropy Stability, and Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a parametric hyperbolic conservation law (SymCLaw) for learning hyperbolic systems directly from data while ensuring conservation, entropy stability, and hyperbolicity by design. Unlike existing approaches that typically enforce only conservation or rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations, our method parameterizes the flux functions in a form that guarantees real eigenvalues and complete eigenvectors of the flux Jacobian, thereby preserving hyperbolicity. At the same time, we embed entropy-stable design principles by jointly learning a convex entropy function and its associated flux potential, ensuring entropy dissipation and the selection of physically admissible weak solutions. A corresponding entropy-stable numerical flux scheme provides compatibility with standard discretizations, allowing seamless integration into classical solvers. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems, including Burgers, shallow water, Euler, and KPP equations, demonstrate that SymCLaw generalizes to unseen initial conditions, maintains stability under noisy training data, and achieves accurate long-time predictions, highlighting its potential as a principled foundation for data-driven modeling of hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <title>High-precision Dynamic Monte Carlo Study of Rigidity Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigidity percolation provides an important basis for understanding the onset of mechanical stability in disordered materials. While most studies on the triangular lattice have focused on static properties at fixed bond~(site) occupation probabilities, the dynamics of the rigidity transition remain less explored. In this work, we formulate a dynamic pebble game algorithm that monitors how rigid clusters emerge and evolve as bonds are added sequentially to an empty lattice, with computational efficiency comparable to the standard static pebble game. We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\,277\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/\nu = 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values.</description>

Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with step initial condition, in which all particles have distinct types. Our main object of interest is the type of the rightmost particle -- the leader -- at large time $t$. We prove a central limit theorem for this random variable. Somewhat unexpectedly, the problem is closely connected to certain observables of voter and coalescing processes on $\mathbb{Z}$; we therefore derive their asymptotics as well. We also analyze the large-time behavior of a few other related observables, including certain multi-particle ones.</description>

      <title>Finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional classical Ising model along its self-dual critical line. Using a fermionic formulation, we express the lattice crosscap overlap in terms of Bogoliubov angles and develop a contour-integral approach by analytically continuing the lattice momentum to the complex plane. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size. We further derive an exact analytical formula for the corresponding decay constant and show that it is determined by the complex singularity structure of the Bogoliubov angle.</description>

Abstract: We prove the past nonlinear stability of the sub-critical Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations on a truncated cone domain in spacetime dimensions $n\geq4$. Our analysis demonstrates that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete in the contracting direction and terminate at quiescent and crushing singularities characterized by the blow-up of curvature invariants. This work generalizes the result of Beyer-Oliynyk-Zheng in [arXiv:2502.09210v2] to all higher dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a principle, implicitly contained in Schroedinger's paper (Schr35), which allows a proof of the non-existence of the EPR-locality paradox in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The paradox is shown to be well-posed already in the simplest example of an entangled state of two spins one-half, independently of the (well-taken) objections by Araki and Yanase that the measurement of spin is not a local measurement. We assume that any measurement results in the collapse of the wave-packet.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the center of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{n|1}$ at the critical level is generated by the coefficients in the expansion of the pseudo-differential operator $(\partial_z-u_1(z))\cdots (\partial_z-u_n(z))(\partial_z+u_{n+1}(z))^{-1}$ taking values in the Cartan subalgebra. This is an affine analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism in the finite case.
  The key ingredient of the proof is the identification of the center with the Heisenberg coset of the regular W-superalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level, whose associated graded algebra is realized as the affine supersymmetric polynomials. Based on this, we derive a character formula for the center, which coincides with the generating function of plane partitions with a pit condition. We also prove that the Heisenberg coset at generic levels has a similar interpretation in terms of pseudo-differential operators that deform the one at the critical level.</description>

      <title>Defect Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{defect relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of defects. We compute the defect relative entropy for conformal/topological defects, deriving a universal formula in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. This formula reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the synchronization zeta function associated with a pair of self-maps of a topological space and investigate its properties. We also define the growth rate of synchronization points and derive an explicit formula in the setting of endomorphisms of compact, connected Abelian groups. In addition, we establish Gauss congruences and describe the asymptotic behavior for the sequence of numbers of synchronization points, under the assumption that the synchronization zeta function is rational. Further, we discuss connections with topological entropy and Reidemeister torsion.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations in hydrodynamics and quantum long-time tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective field theory for the diffusive hydrodynamics of a conserved scalar field. Quantum corrections within the SK framework are guided by fluctuation-dissipation relations, enforced via a dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry. We find that the KMS symmetry necessarily generates fluctuation contributions in the SK effective action at all orders in the noise field, thereby giving rise to intrinsically non-Gaussian noise. We use our results to compute one-loop quantum corrections to the two-point density-density retarded correlation function, leading to a quantum generalization of hydrodynamic long-time tails. Our results apply at arbitrarily high orders in $\hbar$. The one-loop results for retarded correlation functions have been expressed in terms of a family of polynomials. We also provide a closed-form expression for the one-loop results at leading order in the wavevector expansion.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion and anomalous regularization in self-similar random incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a particle in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 2$, subject to molecular diffusion and advection by a random incompressible flow. The velocity field is the divergence of a stationary random stream matrix $\mathbf{k} $ with positive Hurst exponent $\gamma &gt; 0$, so the resulting random environment is multiscale and self-similar. In the perturbative regime $\gamma \ll 1$, we prove quenched power-law superdiffusion: for a typical realization of the environment, the displacement variance at time $t$ grows like $t^{2/(2-\gamma)}$, the scaling predicted by renormalization group heuristics. We also identify the leading prefactor up to a random (quenched) relative error of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^3$. The proof implements a Wilsonian renormalization group scheme at the level of the infinitesimal generator $\nabla \cdot (\nu I_d + \mathbf{k} ) \nabla$, based on a self-similar induction across scales. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained generator is well-approximated, at each scale $r$, by a constant-coefficient Laplacian with effective diffusivity growing like $r^\gamma$. This approximation is inherently scale-local: reflecting the multifractal nature of the environment, the relative error does not decay with the scale, but remains of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^2$. We also prove anomalous regularization under the quenched law: for almost every realization of the drift, solutions of the associated elliptic equation are H\"older continuous with exponent $1 - C\gamma^{\frac12}$ and satisfy estimates which are uniform in the molecular diffusivity $\nu$ and the scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Cauchy problem of a weighted gradient system of semilinear wave equations \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} u_{tt}-\Delta u=\lambda |u|^{\alpha}|v|^{\beta+2}u,\quad v_{tt}-\Delta v=\mu |u|^{\alpha+2}|v|^{\beta}v,\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^d,\ t\in \mathbb{R},\\ u(x,0)=u_{10}(x),\ u_t(x,0)=u_{20}(x),\quad v(x,0)=v_{10}(x),\ v_t(x,0)=v_{20}(x),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^d. \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} Here $d\geq 3$, $\lambda, \mu\in \mathbb{R}$, $\alpha, \beta\geq 0$, $(u_{10},u_{20})$ and $(v_{10},v_{20})$ belong to $H^1(\mathbb{R}^d)\oplus L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ or $\dot{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^d)\oplus L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ or $\dot{H}^{\gamma}(\mathbb{R}^d)\oplus H^{\gamma-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for some $\gamma&gt;1$. Under certain assumptions, we establish the local wellposedness of the $H^1\oplus H^1$-solution, $\dot{H}^1\oplus \dot{H}^1$-solution and $\dot{H}^{\gamma}\oplus \dot{H}^{\gamma}$-solution of the system with different types of initial data.</description>

      <title>Augmentation and Bulk Edge Correspondence for one dimensional aperiodic tight binding operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a particular class of 1D aperiodic models with the aim to understand how their internal degrees of freedom contribute to their topological invariants and the possible relations (correspondences) among them. In order to handle models with finite local complexity we introduce the principle of augmentation. This allows us to relate the values of the Integrated Density of States at gap energies for the bulk system to spectral flows. We consider two different augmentations. The first is based on the mapping torus construction. It leads to an alternative proof of the result that the gap labelling group of Bellissard coincides with that of Johnson-Moser. It furthermore allows for an interpretation of the spectral flow via boundary forces. The second augmentation applies to models obtained by the cut and project method where we find for 2-cut models two different spectral flows, one attached to the edge modes and related to the phason motion whereas the other is an augmented bulk invariant. Our approach is based on the well-established $C^*$-algebraic approach to solid state physics and the description of topological invariants by $K$-theory and cyclic cocycles. We also present numerical simulations to illustrate our theorems.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Averages of Plancherel Random Partitions: Elliptic Functions, Phase Transitions, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random integer partitions $\lambda$ that follow the Poissonized Plancherel measure of parameter $t^2$. Using Riemann$-$Hilbert techniques, we establish the asymptotics of the multiplicative averages $$Q(t,s)=\mathbb{E} \left[ \prod_{i\geq 1} \left(1+\mathrm{e}^{\eta(\lambda_i-i+\frac{1}{2}-s)}\right)^{-1} \right] $$ for fixed $\eta&gt;0$ in the regime $t\to+\infty$ and $s/t=O(1)$. We compute the large-$t$ expansion of $\log Q(t,xt)$ expressing the rate function $\mathcal{F}(x) = -\lim_{t \to \infty}t^{-2}\log Q(t,xt)$ and the subsequent divergent and oscillatory contributions explicitly in terms of elliptic theta functions. The associated equilibrium measure presents, in general, nontrivial saturated regions and it undergoes two third-order phase transitions of different nature which we describe. Applications of our results include an explicit characterization of tail probabilities of the height function of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth model and of the edge of the positive-temperature discrete Bessel process and asymptotics of radially symmetric solutions to the 2D Toda equation with step-like initial data.</description>

Abstract: We analyse a certain family of cellular integrals, which are period integrals on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,8}$ of curves of genus zero with eight marked points, and give rise to simultaneous rational approximations to $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(5)$. By exploiting the action of a large symmetry group on these integrals, we construct an infinite $effective$ sequence of rational approximations $p/q$ to $\zeta(5)$ satisfying \[ 0&lt;\bigg|\zeta(5)-\frac pq\bigg|&lt;\frac1{q^{0.86}}. \]</description>

      <title>Compatible Poisson structures on multiplicative quiver varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any multiplicative quiver variety is endowed with a Poisson structure constructed by Van den Bergh through reduction from a Hamiltonian quasi-Poisson structure. The smooth locus carries a corresponding symplectic form defined by Yamakawa through quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. In this note, we include the Poisson structure as part of a pencil of compatible Poisson structures on the multiplicative quiver variety. The pencil is defined by reduction from a pencil of Hamiltonian quasi-Poisson structures which has dimension $\ell(\ell-1)/2$, where $\ell$ is the number of arrows in the underlying quiver. For each element of the pencil, we exhibit the corresponding compatible symplectic or quasi-Hamiltonian structure. We comment on analogous constructions for character varieties and quiver varieties. This formalism is applied to the spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider phase space in order to explain the compatibility of two Poisson structures that have recently appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>On certain noncommutative geometries via categories of sheaves of PI-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries. These include, for example, superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic $0$, and a topological space $X$. We construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the structure sheaf takes values in the $G$-graded variety $\mathbf{G\text{-}var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$. This provides a framework that classifies geometric spaces whose local models belong to $\mathbf{G\text{-}var}(A)$. We study conditions under which two such geometries can be compared in a (graded) Morita context, as well as the compatibility of their corresponding differential calculi. As an application, we prove a Morita-equivariant Betti/Riemann--Hilbert theorem: varying the coefficients along the Morita $(2,1)$-groupoid, the fixed-coefficient equivalences are compatible with transport and hence induce a biequivalence of Grothendieck totals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an efficient, fully fault-tolerant implementation of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) in the 3D cluster state. The two key novelties are (i) the introduction of a lattice defect in the underlying cluster state and (ii) the use of the Rudolph-Grover rebit encoding. Concretely, (i) allows for a topological implementation of the Hadamard gate, while (ii) does the same for the phase gate. Furthermore, we develop general ideas towards circuit compaction and algorithmic circuit verification, which we implement for the Reed-Muller code used for magic state distillation. Our performance analysis highlights the overall improvements provided by the new methods.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. While we confirm all details of the existing literature, we highlight a potentially important point which may provide a better understanding of and insights on the quantization of gauged systems. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as ``sandwich conditions'': The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and the implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>Quantum accessible information and classical entropy inequalities</title>

Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the recently obtained optimality criterion (A.S. Holevo, Lobachevskii J. Math., \textbf{43}:7 (2022), 1646-1650), when applied to specific ensembles of states leads to nontrivial tight entropy inequalities that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) (B.-G. Englert and J. \v{R}eh\'{a}\v{c}ek, J. Mod. Optics \textbf{57 }N3 (2010) 218-226) is reconsidered and the corresponding entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also an approach to the proof of the conjectures concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids.</description>

      <title>Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stability at One Loop for BPS Membranes in a Lorentz-Covariant RVPD Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first rigorous one-loop proof of quantum stability for BPS membranes in the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD). Exploiting the closure of restricted $\kappa$-symmetry with RVPD ensures that the BRST complex terminates without an infinite ghost tower, keeping the gauge-fixed measure analytically controllable.
  Our main result establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes remain stable, while the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode.
  Our analysis unifies the treatment of zero-modes, connects the effective action to central charges, and clarifies relations to BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for RVPD-based extensions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended Lubrication Theories for Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lubrication theory makes use of the assumptions of a long and thin fluid domain and a small scaled Reynolds number to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Extended lubrication theory aims to improve the model accuracy by relaxing these assumptions and including additional terms in the formulation. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our model with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. The magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Birkhoff theorems and 2+2 direct pruduct spacetimes in Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study 2+2 direct product spacetimes sourced by separated electromagnetic and Yang--Mills fields within Weyl conformal gravity. We prove that all such configurations admit at least 2 independent, commuting non-null Killing vectors, which we use to find general solutions. As a special case, we obtain a generalization of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem to all spacetimes containing a two-dimensional subspace of constant Gaussian curvature, and we also revisit the original formulation of the theorem. We further analyze the resulting solutions in terms of Weyl equivalence classes. Their connections to known solutions in both Weyl conformal gravity and Einstein gravity are established through conformal relations. We also examine the fundamental physical and geometric properties of the newly obtained configurations and their equivalence classes.</description>
