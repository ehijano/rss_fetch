      <title>Dilepton Production in a Rotating Thermal Medium Part I: The Rigid Rotation Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dilepton production in a thermalized quark--gluon plasma subject to global rotation, in the rigid rotating approximation. We consider a generic process involving quark-antiquark annihilation, followed by the emission of a highly energetic virtual photon decaying into a dilepton pair. For this process, we compute the dilepton emission rate from the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor, at finite temperature and vorticity. Our results show that vorticity induces characteristic modifications in the light dilepton channel, namely $e^-e^+$ production, where the emission spectrum exhibits a suppression at low transverse mass together with a mild shift of the production threshold. This behavior originates from the role of vorticity as an effective spin-dependent chemical potential that alters the available phase-space distribution for the emission process. In contrast, the $\mu^-\mu^+$ channel is essentially insensitive to the rotational background, thus remaining dominated by its intrinsic mass threshold. The resulting channel dependence highlights a potential phenomenological handle for disentangling rotational effects in heavy-ion collisions: while light dilepton spectra encode the imprints of vorticity in the infrared sector, the muon channel provides a comparatively robust baseline.</description>

      <title>$\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis and New Implications for Collider Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis in which Standard Model mesons, either $B_{s,d}^0$, $B^\pm$ or $B_c^\pm$, undergo out-of-equilibrium dark CP violating decays to Standard Model and dark sector baryons. With order one CP violation in the dark sector, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can then be generated with branching fractions as small as $2.7 \times 10^{-8}$ for the exotic decay of $B$-mesons into baryons and missing energy. This sets a lower limit on the branching fraction below which Mesogenesis becomes disfavored. This work therefore strongly encourages collider searches to target sensitivities one to three orders of magnitude below planned limits. For completeness, we further introduce a variant on $\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis involving dark lepton states. We conclude by laying out a roadmap for the complete exclusion (or discovery) of the Mesogenesis framework.</description>

      <title>Is our vacuum global in an economical 331 model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the economical 331 model, based on $\beta=-1/\sqrt{3}$, with three $SU(3)$ triplets with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting scalar potential is commonly used in phenomenology. We systematically determine all the potential minima and obtain the conditions under which the electroweak vacuum is global with the help of orbit space methods. For the case the electroweak vacuum is not global, we calculate bounds on the scalar couplings from metastability. We find a parametrisation of the potential couplings in terms of physical quantities and use it to show the available parameter space.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Computational Determination of the Weak Mixing Angle in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle $s_W$ is a fundamental constant in the Standard Model (SM) and measured at the $Z$ boson mass to be $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z) = 0.23129 \pm 0.00004$ in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalization scheme, where $m_Z=91.2\ \text{GeV}$. On the other hand, non-stabilizerness - the magic - characterizes the computational advantage of a quantum system over classical computers. We consider the production of magic from stabilizer initial states, which carry zero magic, in the 2-to-2 scattering of charged leptons in the SM at the tree level, which is mediated by the photon and the $Z$ boson. Using the second order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, and averaging over all 60 initial stabilizer states and the scattering angle, we compute and minimize the magic production as a function of $s^2_W$ in the M\o ller scattering $e^-e^-\to e^-e^-$, which is free of kinematic thresholds. At the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=m_Z$, there is a unique minimum in magic production at $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W(m_Z)=0.2317$, which agrees with the measured $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z)$ at the sub-percent level. At higher energies, the magic-minimizing $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W$ continues to agree with the empirical value at the percent level or better, up to 10 TeV. The finding suggests the electroweak sector of the SM tends to generate minimal quantum resources from the computational viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Small Progenitors, Large Couplings: Type Ic Supernova Constraints on Radiatively Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A is a celebrated laboratory in searches for gamma-ray flashes produced by the radiative decay of sub-GeV particles such as axion-like particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and novel gauge bosons. At large couplings, however, particles decay rapidly inside the stellar envelope, which results in a suppression of the signal. Focusing on the prototypical example of ALPs with a photon coupling, we show that core-collapse SNe of Type Ic are much less affected by this attenuation, thanks to the compactness of their progenitors ensuing from the loss of their envelope. While Fermi-LAT may miss the brief gamma-ray flash from a single Type Ic SN, their high rate allows for a statistical approach: by stacking many events, we can obtain constraints that significantly surpass those from SN 1987A at large couplings. Our approach can be extended to any feebly interacting particle featuring a decay channel into photons.</description>

      <title>Probing Quark Electromagnetic Properties via Entangled Quark Pairs in Fragmentation Hadrons at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic dipole interactions of light quarks induce distinct spin correlations in quark pairs produced at lepton colliders, favoring entangled spin-triplet state aligned along the $\hat{z}$ axis or spin-singlet state. These correlations lead to unique $\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)$ azimuthal asymmetries in inclusive $\pi^+\pi^-$-dihadron pair production and in back-to-back hadron pairs ($\pi\pi,K\pi,KK$), which are absent in the SM. By analyzing Belle and BaBar data and using ratios of azimuthal asymmetries, we demonstrate that these measurements provide robust and significant constraints on light-quark dipole couplings, insensitive to nonperturbative fragmentation functions and free from contamination by other new physics effects. This approach offers a clean and novel probe of light-quark dipole interactions in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Reach of e^+e^- Higgs factory for light higgsinos via electroweak precision observables and comparison with other future facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light higgsinos with mass ~100-400 GeV are well-motivated from naturalness considerations within supersymmetric models. However, at hadron colliders such as CERN LHC, they are rather difficult to search for due to the small visible energy release from heavy higgsino decay to the lightest higgsino, assumed here to be the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). An alternative way to search for the sparticles of supersymmetry is via their virtual effects on electroweak precision observables (EWPO) such as the W boson mass or the effective weak mixing angle \sin^2\theta_{\rm eff}. We quantify the ability of an e^+e^- Higgs factory operating at \sqrt{s}\sim 90-250 GeV to indirectly detect higgsinos via EWPO in the so-called higgsino discovery plane. The latter allows one to compare the relative reach of LHC and high-lumi LHC with an e^+e^- Higgs factory and with a linear e^+e^- collider operating at \sqrt{s}~ 0.5 TeV.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Fundamental Properties of Neutrino from Oscillation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As physicists pursue precision neutrino measurements, complementary experiments covering varied oscillation landscapes have become essential for resolving current tensions in global fits. This thesis presents projected sensitivities and forecasted performance of two next-generation long-baseline experiments: DUNE and T2HK, through detailed simulations addressing fundamental questions including neutrino mass ordering, leptonic CP violation, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. We demonstrate through simulated analyses that while each experiment alone faces inherent degeneracies, their complementary features enable breakthrough projected sensitivities in both standard oscillation parameter measurements and forecasted searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The combined simulation results reveal that DUNE-T2HK synergy will be crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of neutrino properties in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Neural network approximation of Euclidean path integrals and its application for the $\phi^4$ theory in 1+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying phase transitions in interacting quantum field theories generally requires the numerical study of the dynamical system on an N-dimensional lattice, which is, in most cases, computationally quite the challenging task even with modern computing facilities. In this work I propose an alternative way to solve Euclidean path integrals in quantum field theories, using radial basis function-type neural networks, where the nonlinear part of the path integral is approximated by a linear combination of quadratic path integrals, therefore making the corresponding problem analytically tractable. The method allows us to calculate observables in a very efficient way, taking only seconds to do calculations that would otherwise take hours or even days with other existing methods. To test the capabilities of the model, it is used to describe the phase transition in the 1+1 dimensional interacting real scalar $\phi^4$ theory. The obtained phase transition line is compared to previous lattice results, giving very good agreement between them. The method is very flexible and could be extended to higher dimensions, finite temperatures, or even finite densities, therefore, it could give a very good alternative approach for solving numerically hard problems in quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>On Massive Neutrinos and Coherence in Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the central tenet of the current standard theory of neutrino oscillations, namely the assumption that neutrinos are emitted and detected as flavour neutrino states, which are coherent superpositions of massive neutrino states of different masses. We prove that all the quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical arguments, including the invocation of the uncertainty principle and the wave packet description of massive neutrinos, entail the production of neutrinos as statistical ensembles of massive neutrino states. As the states in a statistical ensemble do not interfere, neutrino oscillations cannot be explained by the superposition of massive states. We point out that neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be consistently formulated in theories which include, among other assumptions, the premise that the asymptotic states are massless flavour neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Elliptical Polarization in Partial Wave Analysis of Two Spinless Meson Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical ambiguities in partial-wave analysis present a significant challenge to the extraction of resonance properties in hadronic reactions. Recent work has shown that while linear photon polarization can resolve continuous ambiguities in the photoproduction of two pseudoscalar mesons, a final complex conjugate ambiguity remains. In this work, we extend the partial-wave formalism to include circular and elliptical photon polarization. We demonstrate that the additional constraints provided by circularly polarized observables, which are sensitive to the imaginary parts of bilinear amplitude products, are sufficient to remove remaining mathematical ambiguities, yielding an improved partial-wave solution. Furthermore, we show that the resulting overconstrained system allows for a novel application: using the reaction dynamics themselves as a polarimeter. Using recent high-statistics data on rho(770) photoproduction from the GlueX experiment, we illustrate the viability of this technique in determining the degrees of beam polarization from the data. These results will benefit the next generation of photoproduction experiments at facilities such as Jefferson Lab and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray cooling by dark matter in astrophysical jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical jets from powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) have recently been proposed as promising probes of dark matter (DM) in the sub-GeV mass range. AGN launch relativistic jets that accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energies, which can then interact with their surroundings and produce multiwavelength (MW) emission spanning from radio frequencies to TeV $\gamma$ rays. If DM consists of light particles, their interactions with CRs could lead to an additional cooling mechanism that modifies the expected MW emission. In this work, we analyse the MW spectrum of Markarian 421, a well-studied AGN, using a multizone leptonic jet model that includes the interactions between CR electrons and DM particles. For the first time, we account for the uncertainties in the astrophysical jet dynamics, which have been previously neglected when constraining the CR-DM interactions. By fitting simultaneously jet parameters and DM-electrons interactions, we use the MW data from Markarian 421 to set constraints on the DM-induced CR cooling. We obtain 5$\sigma$ upper limit $\sigma_\text{DM-e} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{-34}~\text{cm}^2$ for a DM mass of $1~{\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that this is about a factor of five weaker than traditional approaches, implying that properly accounting for degeneracies between jet dynamics and DM interactions is key to derive robust constraints on DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Collins-type fragmentation energy correlator in semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of fragmentation energy correlators (FECs), which generalize traditional fragmentation functions and encode non-perturbative information about transverse dynamics in parton fragmentation processes. We define boost-invariant, non-perturbative FECs and derive a corresponding collinear factorization formula. A spin decomposition of the FECs is carried out, analogous to that of transverse-momentum-dependent fragmentation functions. In this work we focus particularly on the Collins-type quark FEC, which is sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking and characterizes the azimuthal asymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark. We perform a next-to-leading-order calculation of the corresponding hard coefficient in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering for the quark non-singlet component, thereby validating the consistency of our theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradients act as invisible engines of transport, converting microscopic imbalances into macroscopic flows, and thus providing deep insights into the dynamics of physical systems. Thermal gradients do not merely drive the flow of heat, but they also set the microscopic constituents of the system into motion. In such scenarios, the constituents of the system not only transport energy but also diffuse collectively under the influence of these gradients. For the very first time, we present a first-principles investigation of the Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. We use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. By incorporating chemical potential and temperature gradients into the kinetic theory framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Dufour coefficient, which quantifies the heat flow due to concentration gradients, and the Soret coefficient, which describes the particle diffusion induced by thermal gradients. These coupled-transport phenomena are traditionally studied in multi-component classical systems at low energy scales. In this study, we follow quasiparticle models for the deconfined phase and the hadron resonance gas model for the confined hadronic phase in the context of heavy-ion collisions. This study provides novel insights into the thermo-diffusion and diffusion-thermo phenomena and opens avenues for incorporating such effects in hydrodynamic modeling and transport simulations of QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Decay of a scalar condensate in two different approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decay of a scalar condensate via interactions with (quasi-)particles is of interest to many fields in physics, including cosmology. In cosmology, the decay of an inflaton condensate leads to the production of daughter particles and reheating of the Universe. In computing the decay rate, two quantum field theoretic approaches can be found in the literature: one is based on parametric resonance of mode functions of the daughter particle; another is based on the $S$-matrix of a coherent state and Feynman-diagrammatic perturbation theory. We modify the latter from the previous literature in a way that manifests what we are computing and does not include unwanted Feynman diagrams. We notice the equivalence of these two approaches and demonstrate it by explicitly computing the decay rate at lower orders in the double expansion of the amplitude of coherent oscillation (or narrow resonance) and velocity of the daughter particle.</description>

      <title>Constraining Multi-scalars models with colliders and Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the observation in 2012 of a new scalar particle closely resembling the Higgs boson of the Standard Model of particle physics, there is a general consensus that there must be Physics Beyond the Standard Model, with present experiments now dedicated to its discovery. Extending the scalar sector is motivated by key unresolved issues in particle physics including the need of new sources of Charge Parity violation,providing an explanation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe, or to explain Dark Matter, which comprises of order 85% of the matter content of the Universe. In this thesis, we focus on three Higgs doublets models (3HDM) and the constraints that need to be imposed. We add theoretical contributions for the consistency of the scalar potential, with boundedness from below and the global minimum. We consider all constraints for full phenomenological studies in models with different symmetries, studying their individual impact and attempting to distinguish the models based on data. We propose a model with CP violating coefficients, leading to Higgs couplings that significantly deviate from Standard Model values and remain allowed. To explore the parameter space of the model, we employ an efficient Machine Learning algorithm that finds new regions of parameter space and observable consequences, not found with previous techniques we developed and applied. The new techniques are applicable to any Physics Beyond the Standard Model scenario. We connect the scalar extensions with experimentally viable solutions to the Dark Matter problem. When building Dark Matter models, one often imposes conserved discrete symmetries to stabilize DM candidates. We consider a possibility with two candidates, and an alternative possibility of a conserved non-Abelian group leading to a viable DM, in an attempt to chart the limits of what Multi-Higgs Models can accommodate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the Gell-Mann--Nishijima formula for the assignment of electric charges to the components of an arbitrary-dimensional multiplet which transforms under general gauge symmetries, regardless of whether these multiplets couple to particles with known charge. The method is valid for local or global unitary symmetries and works for theories with or without spontaneous or explicit symmetry breaking. We extend the method for other conserved charges as flavors (horizontal symmetries) and color (QCD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoproduction processes have gained a renewed interest following the approval of the EIC, making their implementation in Monte Carlo event generators highly desirable. We present recent efforts to develop a POWHEG BOX extension simulating dijet production from direct and resolved photons at next-to-leading order in QCD merged to parton showers, employing the Weizs\"acker-Williams Approximation. It will facilitate event generation for collisions involving leptons, protons and heavy ions. Thus, it will be particularly useful for the study of ultra-peripheral collisions at CERN's LHC and for making predictions relevant to BNL's EIC.</description>

      <title>The QED photon-fermion vertex from its Dyson-Schwinger equation in 4D: the full vertex, the transverse form factors and the perturbative solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06880v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the photon-fermion one-particle irreducible vertex in QED in linear covariant gauges. The longitudinal component of this vertex is described using the Ball-Chiu basis, while its transverse part is expressed with the K{\i}z{\i}lersu-Reenders-Pennington basis. Combining the vertex Ward-Takahashi identity with the vertex equation, we derive a set of exact, non-linear integral equations governing the transverse vertex. These equations hold for any linear covariant gauge and must be solved self-consistently. We discuss several approximations to the exact equations, generalizing results previously obtained at the perturbative one-loop level. Various kinematical configurations are also examined. Furthermore, we compute the perturbative solution of the transverse vertex Dyson-Schwinger equations for all transverse form factors and derive their perturbative asymptotic expressions.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 1+1-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled with Dynamical Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in 1+1-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with one flavor of dynamical fermions. Using the loop-string-hadron framework of the LGT with a bosonic cut-off, we exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonian for finite size systems and calculate matrix elements (MEs) in the eigenbasis for both local and non-local operators. We analyze different indicators to identify the parameter space for quantum chaos at finite lattice sizes and investigate how the ETH behavior emerges in both the diagonal and off-diagonal MEs. Our investigations allow us to study various time scales of thermalization and the emergence of random matrix behavior, and highlight the interplays of the several diagnostics with each other. Furthermore, from the off-diagonal MEs, we extract a smooth function that is closely related to the spectral function for both local and non-local operators. We find numerical evidence of the spectral gap and the memory peak in the non-local operator case. Finally, we investigate aspects of subsystem ETH in the lattice gauge theory and identify certain features in the subsystem reduced density matrix that are unique to gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Towards the Parametric Renormalization of the S-matrix - I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zimmermann's forest formula is the corner stone of perturbative renormalization in QFT. By renormalizing individual Feynman graphs, it generates the UV finite S-matrix. This approach to renormalization makes the graph and all its forests center pieces in the theory of renormalization. On the other hand the positive geometry program delegate the role of Feynman graphs as secondary to the amplitude itself, which are generated by canonical forms associated to positive geometries. State of the art in this program is the convergence of S-matrix theory in local QFTs and string theory as the scattering amplitudes in QFT arise as integrals over certain moduli spaces. These integrals are known as curve integrals. For theories such as $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ theory with massive colored scalars, these integrals are divergent in the UV and have to be regularized. It is then natural to ask if there is a ``forest-like formula'' for these integrals which produce a renormalized amplitude without needing to explicitly invoke the forests associated to divergent subgraphs. In this paper, we initiate such a program by deriving forest-like formula for planar massive $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ amplitudes in $D = 4$ dimensions. Our analysis relies on the insightful manifestation of the forest formula derived by Brown and Kreimer in \cite{Brown:2011pj}, that lead us to a definition of ``tropical counter-term'' for the bare amplitude.</description>

      <title>Exploring Black Hole Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decade has transformed our ability to observe the Universe. Via gravitational waves, merging black holes and neutron stars can now be directly detected, offering unprecedented opportunities to test General Relativity and explore astrophysics in a new way. Driven by this breakthrough, the next generation of detectors is being developed to observe a wider range of sources with greater precision, ushering in a new era in gravitational-wave astronomy: leveraging black holes as probes of new physics.
  This thesis investigates how astrophysical environments, such as plasma, dark-matter structures, and clouds of ultralight bosons, affect black holes and their gravitational-wave signatures. After a short overview of gravitational-wave astrophysics, I study three classes of scenarios. (i) Isolated black holes: I examine boson clouds around black holes, their electromagnetic couplings and the role of surrounding plasma. (ii) Ringdown: I show that plasma can strongly modify the ringdown of charged black holes, whereas realistic dark-matter halos produce no detectable deviations even for next-generation detectors. (iii) Inspiral: for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with boson clouds, I find that orbital resonances typically destroy the cloud unless the orbit is nearly counter-rotating, yielding new and exciting observational signatures. Entering the relativistic regime, I develop a self-consistent perturbative framework to model generic environments in extreme-mass-ratio binaries and apply it to the boson-cloud case. Finally, I construct a model for binaries repeatedly crossing active galactic-nucleus disks and track their long-term orbital evolution. The results of this thesis show how black hole environments shape gravitational-wave signals and open avenues for testing new physics with future observatories such as LISA or the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks are predominantly generated at the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions such that heavy flavor observables have the potential to provide information on the pre-equilibrium medium dynamics. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ to early-time charm quark dynamics in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We employ the IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD framework to model the evolution of the bulk medium. Charm quarks are generated using PYTHIA with nuclear parton distribution functions and evolved using Langevin dynamics within MARTINI. We observe that even though there is significant momentum broadening in the earliest stage, D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ are only weakly sensitive to pre-equilibrium interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnants complement constraints from the inspiral phase, mass-radius measurements, and microscopic theory by providing information about the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) at extreme densities. We perform general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers using EOS models that span the uncertain high-density regime. We find a robust correlation between the ratio of energy and angular momentum lost during the late-time post-merger GW signal - the long ringdown - and the EOS at the highest densities in neutron star cores. Applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals reduces EOS uncertainty at several times saturation density, where no direct constraints currently exist.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is secondarily and inevitably induced by the primordial curvature perturbations beyond the first order of the cosmological perturbation theory. We analytically calculate the integration kernel of the power spectrum of the induced GWs, which is the universal part independent of the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, in the radiation-dominated era and in the matter-dominated era. We derive fully analytic expressions of the GW spectrum when possible. As a minor update, we study the case of the top-hat function as the spectrum of the curvature perturbations. We also discuss generalization in the presence of multiple cosmological eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion-Like Particle mediated Dark Matter with Observational Constraints: A Statistical and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the phenomenological consequences of axion-like particle (ALP) mediated dark matter (DM) on neutron star (NS) structure. Using a relativistic mean-field framework with non-linear mesonic self-interactions constrained by nuclear data and astrophysical observations, we explore the DM parameter space spanning $m_\chi \in [0, 1000]~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $q_f \in [0, 0.06]~\mathrm{GeV}$, generating over 30,000 equations of state (EoSs). Two representative hadronic EoSs are employed, a stiff (EoS1) and a soft (EoS18), with explicit inclusion of the crustal EoS. A multi-tiered statistical filtering scheme, combining voting, likelihood, and kernel density estimation scores, is applied using constraints from radio and X-ray pulsars, GW170817, and the low-mass compact object HESS J1731-347. We find that models satisfying the PSR J0614$-$3329 radius bound automatically comply with HESS, positioning ALP-mediated DM as a viable explanation for low-mass compact objects while still supporting $2\,M_\odot$ NSs. For the stiff EoS, we obtain $m_\chi \gtrsim 43~\mathrm{GeV}$, with score-weighted posteriors favoring $q_f = 0.034^{+0.020}_{-0.012}$ and a broad allowed DM mass range $m_\chi \in [101, 949]~\mathrm{GeV}$ (median $\sim 466$ GeV). The soft EoS yields no strict lower bound, though large $m_\chi$--$q_f$ combinations are disfavored. A high-precision supervised regression model built with AutoGluon achieves $R^2 &gt; 0.998$ for inferring DM parameters from NS observables. Feature analysis reveals $m_\chi$ is constrained by structural ratios such as $R_{1.6}/R_{1.4}$, whereas $q_f$ is set mainly by the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature Yang-Mills theories with the density of states method: towards the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first-order, confinement/deconfinement phase transition appears in the finite temperature behavior of many non-Abelian gauge theories. These theories play an important role in proposals for completion of the Standard Model of particle physics, hence the phase transition might have occurred in the early stages of evolution of our universe, leaving behind a detectable relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Lattice field theory studies implementing the density of states method have the potential to provide detailed information about the phase transition, and measure the parameters determining the gravitational-wave power spectrum, by overcoming some the challenges faced with importance-sampling methods. We assess this potential for a representative choice of Yang-Mills theory with $Sp(4)$ gauge group. We characterize its finite-temperature, first-order phase transition, in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit, for two different choices of number of sites in the compact time direction, hence taking the first steps towards the continuum limit extrapolation. We demonstrate the persistence of non-perturbative phenomena associated to the first-order phase transition: coexistence of states, metastability, latent heat, surface tension. We find consistency between several different strategies for the extraction of the volume-dependent critical coupling, hence assessing the size of systematic effects. We also determine the minimum choice of ratio between spatial and time extent of the lattice that allows to identify the contribution of the surface tension to the free energy. We observe that this ratio scales non-trivially with the time extent of the lattice, and comment on the implications for future high-precision numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB Formulation of Quantization and Particle Production in Time-Dependent Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divergence in perturbative expansions is where interesting physics takes place. Particle production on time-dependent backgrounds, as one such example, is interpreted as transition from one vacuum to another. Vacuum is typically defined as an asymptotic state in which the WKB approximation is valid. The use of the WKB method, however, poses several conceptual and computational issues, as the WKB series is divergent in general, quantization is insensitive to higher orders in the series, and the global behavior of solutions cannot be captured. Exact WKB analysis is a powerful resummation technology that provides an analytical tool for a global structure of exact solutions to overcome these problems. In this paper, we establish quantization by fully employing the exact WKB solutions as mode functions and by defining the vacua with respect to them. We provide a self-contained exact WKB formulation to obtain evolution matrices without resorting to the use of known special functions and without approximations. We find that the quantity called Voros coefficient plays an important role to re-normalize the exact WKB solutions compatible with asymptotic states. We show that the ambiguity that coexists with nontrivial Voros coefficients is eliminated by requiring physical quantization conditions. Our formalism provides a conceptual as well as practical framework to upgrade our treatment of quantization and particle production. Combined with other approximating techniques, it can form a basis to tackle a broad class of problems that are beyond technical ability of the existing formulations.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$, a $1+1$-dimensional confining gauge theory with fundamental scalar quarks, whose meson spectrum is governed by a Bethe-Salpeter equation structurally parallel to the 't Hooft equation. Exploiting this structural analogy, we develop a nonperturbative analytic framework, based on integrability and inspired by the Fateev-Lukyanov-Zamolodchikov (FLZ) method, originally devised for the 't Hooft model and later extended in our previous works. Notably, the same Bethe-Salpeter equation also arises in the description of interchain mesons in the doubled Ising model coupled via a spin-spin interaction term. Within the FLZ approach, we find spectral sums and derive a systematic large-$n$ WKB expansion for the meson spectrum. The analytic results reproduce the expected behavior in key asymptotic regimes, such as the near-critical limit $m\to g/\sqrt{\pi}$ and the heavy-quark regime $m\gg g$, and are in good agreement with numerical data. Finally, by analytically continuing the mass parameter into the complex plane, we uncover two infinite families of singularities where individual mesons become massless, suggesting a hidden connection to nontrivial Conformal Field Theories.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of bubble size distributions in a first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT), the true and false vacuum bubble radius distributions are not expected to be monochromatic, as is usually assumed. Consequently, Fermi balls (FBs) and primordial black holes (PBHs) produced in a dark FOPT will have extended mass distributions. We show how gravitational wave (GW), microlensing and Hawking evaporation signals for extended bubble radius/mass distributions deviate from the case of monochromatic distributions. The peak of the GW spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies, and the spectrum is broadened at frequencies below the peak frequency. Thus, the radius distribution of true vacuum bubbles introduces another uncertainty in the evaluation of the GW spectrum from a FOPT. The extragalactic gamma-ray signal at AMEGO-X/e-ASTROGAM from PBH evaporation may evince a break in the power-law spectrum between 5 MeV and 10 MeV for an extended PBH mass distribution. Optical microlensing surveys may observe PBH mass distributions with average masses below $10^{-10} M_\odot$, which is not possible for monochromatic mass distributions. This expands the FOPT parameter space that can be explored with microlensing.</description>

Abstract: The FAIR Universe HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge focused on measuring the physical properties of elementary particles with imperfect simulators. Participants were required to compute and report confidence intervals for a parameter of interest regarding the Higgs boson while accounting for various systematic (epistemic) uncertainties. The dataset is a tabular dataset of 28 features and 280 million instances. Each instance represents a simulated proton-proton collision as observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. The features of these simulations were chosen to capture key characteristics of different types of particles. These include primary attributes, such as the energy and three-dimensional momentum of the particles, as well as derived attributes, which are calculated from the primary ones using domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, a label feature designates each instance's type of proton-proton collision, distinguishing the Higgs boson events of interest from three background sources. As outlined in this paper, the permanent release of the dataset allows long-term benchmarking of new techniques. The leading submissions, including Contrastive Normalising Flows and Density Ratios estimation through classification, are described. Our challenge has brought together the physics and machine learning communities to advance our understanding and methodologies in handling systematic uncertainties within AI techniques.</description>

Abstract: The calculation of scattering amplitudes at higher orders in perturbation theory has reached a high degree of maturity. However, their usage to produce physical predictions within Monte Carlo programs is often precluded by the slow evaluation of two- and higher-loop virtual amplitudes, particularly those calculated numerically. As a remedy, interpolation frameworks have been successfully used for amplitudes depending on up to two kinematic invariants. For amplitude interpolation with more variables, such as the five dimensions of a 2 -&gt; 3 phase space, efficient and reliable solutions are sparse.
  This work aims to pave the way for using amplitude interpolation in higher-dimensional phase spaces by reviewing state-of-the-art interpolation methods, and assessing their performance on a selection of 2 -&gt; 3 scattering amplitudes. Specifically, we investigate interpolation methods based on polynomials, splines, spatially adaptive sparse grids, and neural networks (multilayer perceptron and Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer), all under the constraint of limited obtainable data. Our additional aim is to motivate further studies of the interpolation of scattering amplitudes among both physicists and mathematicians.</description>

      <title>The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

Abstract: Charge sum rules for quark fragmentation functions are studied. The simultaneous implementation of the conservation of electric and baryon charges, strangeness and isospin symmetry is achieved when the fragmentation to both mesons and baryons is considered. The results are compatible to Gell-Mann--Nishijima formulas and may be the new manifestation of superconformal symmetry between mesons and baryons. The numerical estimates are performed and compared with phenomenological models. The recently suggested violations of sum rules due to Wilson lines contributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Galvano-rotational effect induced by electroweak interactions in pulsars"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this comment, we show that the fundamental equation worked by Dvornikov in his paper is incorrect, which is given by the Dirac equation for a neutrino interacting with matter in a rotating frame (or curved space-time). In particular, Dvornikov incorrectly wrote/defined the interaction term (effective potentials or background matter) in a curved space-time. Consequently, one of his main results (if not the main one), namely the relativistic energy spectrum, is also incorrect (actually partially incorrect). So, starting from the correct Dirac equation with effective potentials in a curved space-time, we obtain the correct energy spectrum for a neutrino interacting with matter in a rotating frame. We observe that the square root of this spectrum is very different from that obtained by Dvornikov. In fact, in our case, the spectrum was obtained from a Bessel equation subject to a hard-wall confining potential, while the Dvornikov spectrum was obtained from an associated Laguerre equation. However, we note that the only correct thing in the Dvornikov spectrum are the terms outside the square root, which agree with those of the correct spectrum.</description>

Abstract: The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is modified by quantum corrections, described by a series of higher-dimension operators. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models in which the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated by the Higgs field is consistent with CMB observations and can lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous CP violation during the electroweak phase transition can induce a twisting of the magnetic field configuration of Standard Model dumbbells, resulting in sizable intergalactic magnetic fields and a small baryon asymmetry, in agreement with observations. We demonstrate this by coupling the electroweak gauge group of the Standard Model to an axion-like particle with a non-vanishing velocity. Studying the resulting monopole, string and dumbbell configurations, we conclude that the helicity fraction of the magnetic fields generated at the electroweak phase transition is roughly given by the dimensionless axion velocity.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of pQCD energy loss across system size, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present suppression predictions from our pQCD-based energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections, for high-$p_T$ $\pi$, $D$ and $B$ meson $R_{AB}$ as a function of centrality, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$ from large to small collision systems at RHIC and LHC. A statistical analysis is used to constrain the effective strong coupling in our model to available high-$p_T$ suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, yielding good agreement with all available data. We estimate two important theoretical uncertainties in our model, stemming from: the transition between vacuum and hard thermal loop propagators in the collisional energy loss, and from the angular cutoff on the radiated gluon momentum. We find, consistently, that the extracted $\alpha_s$ remains relatively unchanged across heavy- and light-flavor final states and across central, semi-central, and peripheral collisions. We make predictions from our large-system-constrained model for small systems and find good agreement with photon-normalized $R^{\pi^0}_{d \text{Au}} \simeq 0.75 $ in $0-5\%$ centrality $d$ + Au collisions by PHENIX. However, we find strong disagreement with the measured $R^{h^{\pm}}_{p \text{Pb}} \gtrsim 1$ in $0-5\%$ centrality $p$ + Pb collisions by ALICE and ATLAS; we argue that this disagreement is due, in large part, to centrality bias. We make predictions for the ratio of suppression in ${}^3$He + Au and $p$ + Au collisions, which may in the future be used to disentangle final- from initial-state suppression in small systems. We then compare our results to various subsets of data, which allows us to estimate the preferred: low-$p_T$ scale at which non-perturbative processes become important, scales at which the strong coupling runs, and scale at which vacuum propagators transition to thermally modified propagators in collisional energy loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum gravity scale within the dark dimension scenario ($M_* \sim 10^{9}~{\rm GeV}$) roughly coincides with the energy scale of the KM3-230213A neutrino ($E_\nu \sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$). We propose an interpretation for this intriguing coincidence in terms of Hawking evaporation of five-dimensional (5D) primordial black holes (PBHs). 5D PBHs are bigger, colder, and longer-lived than 4D PBHs of the same mass. For brane observers, PBHs residing in the higher-dimensional bulk decay essentially invisibly (only through gravitationally and sterile coupled modes). As a consequence, constraints on the density of PBHs relative to that of dark matter from null searches of Hawking evaporation can be avoided. We demonstrate that Hawking evaporation of 5D bulk PBHs can explain the KM3-230213A neutrino, evade constraints from upper limits on the gamma-ray flux, and remain consistent with IceCube upper limits on the partial decay width of superheavy dark matter particles into neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHC data have unveiled unexpected features in proton-proton (pp) collisions, namely, collective-like behavior and strangeness enhancement. Originally, these new effects were discovered only in high-multiplicity pp collisions. However, recently the ALICE Collaboration has shown that even low-multiplicity pp collisions yield a non-zero elliptic flow ($v_{2}$). Moreover, analyses as functions of the event structure, such as transverse spherocity, suggest that multiplicity might not be the main driver of the new effects. Therefore, new ways of analyzing the data have to be explored in order to understand the origin of the new phenomena. In this paper, pp collisions simulated with PYTHIA 8 are analyzed using different event estimators (mid-pseudorapidity multiplicity, spherocity, sphericity, $R_T$, forward multiplicity and flattenicity). The features of the selected events for the top 0.1% using the different estimators are discussed. The transverse momentum spectrum of primary particles and the recoil jet distributions are analyzed. The results suggest that flattenicity is the estimator with the least bias on the neutral-to-charged particle ratio, and on the bias towards harder-than-average pp collisions.</description>

      <title>On the Standard Model Mass Spectrum and Interactions In the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified, ultraviolet-finite framework for the full Standard Model particle mass spectrum based on the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory augmented by nonlocal entire-function regulators. Starting from a single holomorphic action on the complexified spacetime manifold \( M^4_{\mathbb{C}} \), with a Hermitian metric unifying gravity, gauge, and matter sectors, we embed exponential regulator insertions to render all loop integrals finite without breaking gauge or diffeomorphism invariance. After spontaneous breaking of the electroweak and grand unified symmetries, analytic expressions for the charged lepton, quark, and neutrino mass matrices are derived in terms of holomorphic Yukawa textures and regulator form factors. A minimal Froggatt-Nielsen flavon sector fixes all \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) coefficients in terms of two continuous inputs. Regulator-suppressed one- and two-loop renormalization group evolution then yields predictions for all fermion masses, CKM and PMNS mixing angles, \( W \) and \( Z \) boson masses, and the Higgs boson mass and self-couplings. Finally, we show that gauge coupling unification, three chiral families, hypercharge quantization, and the shape of the Higgs potential are genuine predictions of the holomorphic nonlocal framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify that chemical and kinetic equilibration in the early Universe are distinct: neither implies the other, and the ordering of their decouplings need not be universal. We illustrate this with Standard-Model neutrino decoupling, strong-washout leptogenesis, dark-matter scenarios where kinetic decoupling precedes chemical freeze-out (resonant/forbidden, conversion/coannihilation, coscattering), and dark sectors at with temperatures distinct from the visible-sector temperature, with semi-annihilation or 3 $\to$ 2 cannibal dynamics. The moral of the story is simple: Chemical equilibrium governs numbers, kinetic equilibrium governs shapes. In an expanding Universe the operators that control them rarely fade at the same time, and when they do not, the order of decoupling is model dependent. Turning to phase-space evolution whenever momentum selectivity matters is the surest way to obtain robust cosmological predictions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel probe of the nucleon's transversity distribution, $h_1^q$, using the one-point energy correlator (OPEC), an infrared-and-collinear safe jet substructure observable. We demonstrate that in transversely polarized $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions, the OPEC exhibits a single-spin asymmetry (SSA) with a clean $\sin(\phi_s - \phi_n)$ angular dependence. This method probes SSA over a much wider kinematic range in the angular scale $\theta_n$ compared to traditional measurements of hadron transverse momentum~$j_\perp$, establishing a complementary and systematically distinct channel to study the nucleon's three-dimensional structure at RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extension to the Standard Model (SM) with four new fields including scalar($S$), spinor($\psi^{1,2}$) and vector($V_\mu$) under new $U(1)$ gauge group in the hidden sector. The scalar particle interacts with the SM Higgs particle and is an intermediary between the dark and the SM parts . Our dark matter(DM) candidate is the spinor particle. We show that the model successfully explains the relic density of the DM in the universe and evades the strong bounds from direct detection experiments while respecting the theoretical constraints and the vacuum stability conditions. In addition, we study the hierarchy problem within the Veltman approach by solving the renormalization group equations at one-loop. We demonstrate that the addition of the new fields contributes to the Veltman parameters which in turn results in satisfying the Veltman conditions much lower than the Planck scale. For the our DM model we find one representative point in the viable parameter space which satisfy also the Veltman conditions at $\Lambda$ = 1 TeV. Therefore, the presence of the extra particle solves the fine-tuning problem of the Higgs mass.</description>

      <title>Decay of Nambu-Goto Cosmic String Loops via Coupling to a Massive Kalb-Ramond Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Nambu-Goto cosmic string loops coupled to a massive Kalb-Ramond field. This coupling provides a framework for describing the interaction between the cosmic string and the gauge field. Within this setup, we compute the energy flux associated with the radiation of massive Kalb-Ramond modes from oscillating string loops. For loops featuring kinks, we find that the decay time scales with the square of the loop length. In contrast, loops with cusps exhibit a decay time proportional to 3/2 times the loop length. The results are in good agreement with field-theoretic simulations of Nambu-Goto-like loops in the Abelian-Higgs model, supporting the validity of the calculation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Duet by Resonating Binary Black Holes within Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations have significantly broadened our capacity to explore fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model, providing crucial insights into dark matter that are inaccessible through conventional methods. Here, we investigate the resonant interactions between binary black hole systems and solitons, self-gravitating configurations of ultralight bosonic dark matter, which induce metric perturbations and generate distinct oscillatory patterns in gravitational waves. Upcoming experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna could detect the oscillatory patterns in gravitational waveforms, providing an evidence for solitons. Because the effect relies solely on gravity, it does not assume any coupling of the dark sector to Standard Model particles, highlighting the capability of future gravitational-wave surveys to probe dark matter.</description>

      <title>Thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan (NY) anomaly using holography, finding that the U(1) axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We show that the axial response associated with the NY term is distinct from the chiral vortical effect and exhibits a characteristic $T^2$ dependence. Torsion-induced axial transport decouples spin and axial charge dynamics, thereby clarifying the physical significance of the NY anomaly and motivating further field-theoretic and holographic studies.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-P\'erot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement features in scattering mediated by heavy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by an intermediate heavy particle exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\eta'(958)$ nuclear states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely. Possible exceptions resulting from the dynamics of the nearby $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $J=({\frac{1}{2}})^-$ nucleon resonance $N^{\ast}$(1895) are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Exotic Dark Matter and the DESI Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincidence problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics with multiple charges and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges. In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Lattice results for the equation of state in dense QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Black Hole in the accelerating Universe approaching the future singularity -- Possible origin of (super-)massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.
  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.</description>
