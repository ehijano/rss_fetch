      <title>Lindblad Quantum Dynamics as Euler-Poincar\'e Reduction on Adjoint-Coupled Semidirect Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric and variational derivation of the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad equation from Euler--Poincar'e reduction on an adjoint--coupled semidirect product (ACSP). In this construction a Lie group $G$ acts on $V=\mathfrak{g}^{\oplus m}$ by the adjoint representation together with a second, adjointly compatible action whose failure to commute defines an adjoint torsion $K(\xi,v)$. This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\tfrac{\gamma}{2}[L,[L,\rho]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow. In this picture, decoherence is a curvature--induced contraction generated by Euler--Poincar'e reduction rather than a phenomenological input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article one introduces a formalism of classical mechanics where complex Lagrangian functions are admitted. The results include complex versions of the Lagrangian function, of the Euler-Lagrange equation, of the Hamilton principle, a geometric formulation, and the relation to a previous complex Hamiltonian formalism. The framework is particularly suitable for non-stationary motion, and various pathways can be followed in future investigation.</description>

      <title>On Fredholm Pfaffians and Riemann-Hilbert problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown how classes of Fredholm Pfaffians can be computed in terms of canonical, auxiliary Riemann-Hilbert problems as soon as the main kernel in the Pfaffian is either of additive Hankel composition or of truncated Wiener-Hopf type. Akhiezer-Kac asymptotic results for the Fredholm Pfaffians are then derived as natural consequences of the Riemann-Hilbert characterisation.</description>

      <title>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a&lt;0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a&gt;0$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture under the additional condition that $a&gt;\lambda/3$, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Variability Alters Macroscopic Rotation Speed in Stochastic Spiral Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory for noise-induced corrections to the angular velocity of spiral waves. Stochasticity produces two second-order effects: an instantaneous term from heterogeneity that always slows rotation, and an orbital-drift term from temporal fluctuations that can either accelerate or decelerate it. For our parameters, orbital drift is weaker, producing a net slowdown. Analytical predictions match Barkley-model simulations with temporal noise. Examination of additional noise types in silico confirms angular velocity slowing. This mechanism provides a robust route by which stochasticity reshapes spiral dynamics in excitable media, with direct implications for arrhythmias and neural wave propagation.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the DHR theorem for higher form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) reconstruction theorem shows that standard ($0$-form) internal symmetries are associated to groups in relativistic quantum field theory in spacetime dimension $D&gt;2$. In particular, non-invertible symmetry structures in $D&gt;2$ correspond to the choice of a subtheory of a unique parent one, where the symmetry is a compact group. We present a theorem that generalizes this result to higher form symmetries. We first re-formulate the DHR theorem in terms of Haag duality violations (HDV) for regions with non-trivial homotopy group $\pi_0$ in the finite index case. In this light, the theorem states that the category associated with such HDV is the dual of a group, and it can be extended to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios. Then, after eliminating $\pi_0$ sectors via DHR reconstruction, we show that the HDV corresponding to regions with non-trivial $\pi_i$, $0&lt;i&lt;D-2$, are associated with abelian groups. Physically, the result shows that generalized order/disorder parameters in $D&gt;2$ are labeled by such groups, in agreement with the case of confinement order parameters in Yang-Mills theories (Wilson and 't Hooft loops). For the special case of $D=4n$ and loops of dimension $k=2 n-1$, the group is further required to have a Hermitian character table. This does not rule out the possibility of an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor that is not achievable by Lagrangian gauge models. In the way we find a new proof of the group-like origin of internal symmetries, and analyze the sectors for more general regions, e.g., direct sums, knots, and links. In particular, we find that generalized knot order parameters are classified by the unknot order parameters, and the commutator of knot non-local operators is determined by the linking number.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $O (N)$ linear sigma model and its mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large $N$ limits of the hyperbolic $O(N)$ linear sigma model ($\text{HLSM}_N$) on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, namely, a system of $N$ interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) with coupled cubic nonlinearities. After establishing (pathwise) global well-posedness of $\text{HLSM}_N$ and the limiting equation, called the mean-field SdNLW, we first establish convergence of $\text{HLSM}_N$ to the mean-field SdNLW with general initial data (under a suitable assumption). In particular, for the local-in-time convergence, we obtain a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. We then show that the invariant Gibbs dynamics for $\text{HLSM}_N$) converges to that for the mean-field SdNLW with a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ on any large time intervals.</description>

      <title>Volumes of moduli spaces of bordered Klein surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise Mirzakhani's recursion to volumes of moduli spaces of bordered Klein surfaces, which include non-orientable surfaces. On these moduli spaces, the top form introduced by Norbury diverges as the lengths of 1-sided geodesics approach zero. However, when integrated over Gendulphe's regularised moduli space, on which the systole of 1-sided geodesics is bounded below by $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, it returns a finite value. Using Norbury's extension of the Mirzakhani--McShane identities to non-orientable surfaces, we derive an explicit formula for the volume of the moduli space of one-bordered Klein bottles, as well as a recursion for arbitrary topologies that fully captures the dependence on Gendulphe's regularisation parameter $\epsilon$. We further relate these results to refined topological recursion, showing that, for a fixed refinement parameter, the volumes of moduli spaces of Klein surfaces with Euler characteristic $-1$ are governed by this procedure, and we conjecture the same holds for general topologies.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Non-invertible Symmetry Behind Supersymmetric ADE Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-perturbative constraints imposed by intrinsic fermionic non-invertible symmetries in 1+1 dimensional gapped systems remain largely unexplored. In this letter, we propose the superstrip algebra as a unified framework to catalog the categorical symmetry data in a massive fermionic model. The algebra and its representations explicitly encode the vacuum structure, soliton degeneracies, and their quantum numbers. As a demonstration, we apply this framework to the $\mathcal N=2$ minimal models with their least relevant deformation. We show that this specific deformation alone preserves a non-invertible superfusion category, a fermionic variant of $\text{SU}(2)_k$ known to underlie the $ADE$ classification of critical theories. Its superstrip algebra then accounts for the origin of the resulting $ADE$-type soliton spectrum and their fractional fermion number. Although our primary examples are supersymmetric and integrable, our framework itself relies on neither property, providing a new powerful tool for studying a broad class of strongly-coupled fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Landau Hamiltonian with Gaussian white noise potential and the asymptotic of its bottom of spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple construction of a random Schr\"odinger operator subject to a magnetic field with a regularity as low as $0^-$-H\"older and a Gaussian white noise electric potential on a two-dimensional bounded box. This construction is based on the exponential Ansatz introduced in [HL15] and leverages the semigroup approach developed in [HL24].
  The proposed construction enables us to generalise an asymptotic result for the bottom of the spectrum of the two-dimensional continuous Anderson Hamiltonian, first proved in [CvZ21], to the magnetic case. Our choice of potential not only covers the case of a uniform magnetic field, but also those which would break translational invariance.</description>

      <title>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.</description>

      <title>Quantum resource degradation theory within the framework of observational entropy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum resource theories, traditional scalar measures often fail to capture the evolution of the quality of a resource under free operations. To address this limitation, we propose a quantum resource degradation theory based on the decomposition of observational entropy. We demonstrate that the total inconsistency measure, $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{C}}$, can be decomposed into two independent components: inter-block coherence, $\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$, and intra-block noise, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$. This decomposition reveals a significant degradation mechanism: under specific free operations, quantum coherence degrades into classical noise. Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $\eta$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics. We validate the theory through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), demonstrating its utility in diagnosing and explaining the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP). The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for managing resource quality, complementing traditional resource quantification. This contributes to the optimization of quantum technologies on current and near-term noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Computation and Verification of Spectra for Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between quantum mechanics and computation, revealing fundamental limitations for algorithms computing spectra, especially in non-Hermitian settings. Introducing the concept of locally trivial pseudospectra (LTP), we show such assumptions are necessary for spectral computation. LTP adapts dynamically to system energies, enabling spectral analysis across a broad class of challenging non-Hermitian problems. Exploiting this framework, we overcome a longstanding obstacle by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the imaginary cubic oscillator $H_{\mathrm{B}} = p^2 + i x^3$ with error bounds and no spurious modes -- yielding, to our knowledge, the first such error-controlled result. We confirm, for instance, the 100th eigenvalue as $627.6947122484365113526737029011536\ldots$. Here, truncation-induced $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking causes spurious eigenvalues -- a pitfall our method avoids, highlighting the link between truncation and physics. Finally, we illustrate the approach's generality via spectral computations for a range of physically relevant operators. This letter provides a rigorous framework linking computational theory to quantum mechanics and offers a precise tool for spectral calculations with error bounds.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Measurements with respect to the Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fidelity is the standard measure for quantifying the similarity between two quantum states. It is equal to the square of the minimum Bhattacharyya coefficient between the probability distributions induced by quantum measurements on the two states. Though established for over thirty years, the structure of fidelity-optimal quantum measurements remains unclear when the two density operators are singular (not invertible). Here we address this gap, with a focus on minimal optimal measurements, which admit no nontrivial coarse graining that is still optimal. We show that there exists either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many inequivalent choices. Moreover, the first case holds if and only if the two density operators satisfy a weak commutativity condition. In addition, we provide a complete characterization of all minimal optimal measurements when one state is pure, leveraging geometric insights from the Bloch-sphere representation. The connections with quantum incompatibility, operator pencils, and geometric means are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Ratio asymptotics and zero density for orthogonal polynomials with varying Verblunsky coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic behavior of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with varying Verblunsky coefficients $\alpha_{n,N}$.
  First, we give a streamlined proof of ratio asymptotics for orthogonal and paraorthogonal polynomials in the case when $\alpha_{n,N}$ is asymptotically constant or asymptotically periodic as $n/N\to t&gt;0$.
  Second, we determine the asymptotic zero density of paraorthogonal polynomials in the locally constant and locally periodic regimes, and obtain analogous results for orthogonal polynomials under an additional condition $|\alpha_{n-1,N}|^{1/n}\to 1$.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Fidelity Estimation with Common Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient fidelity estimation of multiqubit quantum states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. However, to estimate the infidelity $\epsilon$ with multiplicative precision, conventional estimation protocols require (order) $1/\epsilon^2$ different circuits in addition to $1/\epsilon^2$ samples, which is quite resource-intensive for high-precision fidelity estimation. Here we introduce an efficient estimation protocol by virtue of common randomized measurements (CRM) integrated with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, which only requires $1/\epsilon $ circuits. Moreover, in many scenarios of practical interest, in the presence of depolarizing or Pauli noise for example, our protocol only requires a constant number of circuits, irrespective of the infidelity $\epsilon$ and the qubit number. For large and intermediate quantum systems, quite often one circuit is already sufficient. In the course of study, we clarify the performance of CRM shadow estimation based on the Clifford group and 4-designs and highlight its advantages over standard and thrifty shadow estimation.</description>

      <title>3D Modeling of Solar Oscillations with Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing quantity and quality of solar observations, it becomes essential to account for three-dimensional heterogeneities in wave modeling for seismic data interpretation. In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations.</description>

      <title>Holographic origin of $a$-maximization and higher-derivative AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a consistent partially off-shell framework for evaluating higher-derivative actions of five-dimensional $\cal{N}=1$ gauged supergravity with abelian vector multiplets on AdS$_5$. Using the superconformal formalism, we show that the resulting holographic expression reproduces the trial $a$-anomaly coefficient of the dual conformal field theory, identifying the supergravity equations of motion with $a$-maximization. We present an exact correspondence between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial of the boundary theory. We illustrate our proposal by applying it to all known two- and four-derivative actions, including the ``off-diagonal'' invariants never before considered in the gauged supergravity literature. Finally, we argue that all invariants beyond four-derivative yield no genuinely new contributions to asymptotically AdS$_5$ BPS backgrounds, but instead reduce to linear combinations of the established two- and four-derivative actions.</description>

      <title>A Universal Smarr Formula via Coupling Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gravitational theories containing matter fields and higher-derivative corrections, the standard Smarr formula often fails unless all dimensionful couplings are incorporated consistently. Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Slow Mixing of the Low Temperature SK Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborov\'a 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</description>

      <title>Tensor complex renormalization with generalized symmetry and topological bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in generalized symmetry and topological holography has shown that, in conformal field theory (CFT), topological data from one dimensional higher can play a key role in determining local dynamics. Based on this insight, a fixed-point (FP) tensor complex (TC) for CFT has recently been constructed. In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry. We show that the full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of the primary fields. Remarkably, even when starting solely from topological data, the RG process can still reconstruct the full FP tensor--a method we call as topological bootstrap. This approach deepens the connection between the topological and dynamical aspects of CFT and suggests pathways toward a fully algebraic description of gapless quantum states, with potential extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate cyclic dominance models and their extensions to both network systems and reaction-diffusion frameworks. Using linear stability analysis, we establish the relationship between the stability of synchronized states in network systems and the response of homogeneous solutions subjected to spatially periodic perturbations. Furthermore, we explore the mathematical properties of networks characterized by strong nonlinear oscillations in an ecological context. Finally, we present numerical results for the master stability function of a competitive three-species Lotka-Volterra model, highlighting its role in understanding the dynamics of cyclic competition.</description>

      <title>Cosserat micropolar and couple-stress elasticity models of flexomagnetism at finite deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose geometrically nonlinear (finite) continuum models of flexomagnetism based on the Cosserat micropolar and its descendent couple-stress theory. These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the atypical fluctuations of the ground state energy of the random elastic manifold, a disordered model defined on a lattice of linear size $L$ with internal dimension $0\leq d&lt;4$ embedded in a medium of dimension $N\gg 1$. The ground-state energy results from a competition between confinement, elasticity and disorder. We obtain an exact description of the large deviation rate function with speed $NL^d$ and its different phases, corresponding to different patterns of replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results show that the ground-state energy satisfies a central limit theorem and we obtain an explicit expression for the rescaled variance. In the (massless) limit of zero confinement, this variance vanishes for short-range disorder and the ground-state energy displays super-concentration. From our results on the large deviation function, we characterise explicitly the left tail of the distribution of the typical fluctuations of the ground state energy. It displays an exponential tail for a one step RSB pattern while for a full RSB pattern it decays super-exponentially with a non trivial exponent $\xi$ that we compute explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear late-time tails on dynamical black hole spacetimes via time integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the global leading-order late-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions to inhomogeneous wave equations on dynamical black hole exterior backgrounds that settle down to Schwarzschild backgrounds with arbitrarily small decay rates. In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.
  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time "tails", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.
  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact renormalisation scheme for fermionic cellular automata on hypercubic lattices. By grouping neighbouring cells into tiles and selecting subspaces within them, multiple evolution steps on the original system correspond to a single step of an effective automaton acting on the subspaces. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalisability and fully characterise the renormalisation flow for two-cell tiles and two time steps of nearest-neighbour fermionic automata on a chain of spinless modes, identifying all fixed points.</description>

      <title>Random purification channel made simple</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23470v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjugate operator $T$ of one-dimensional harmonic oscillator $N$ is defined by an operator satisfying canonical commutation relation $[N,T]=-i\one$ on some domain but not necessarily a dense one. Examples of conjugate operators include the angle operator $\TA$ and the Galapon operator $\TG$. Let $\sT$ denote a set of conjugate operators of $N$ of the form $T_{\omega,m}=\frac{i}{m}\log(\omega\one-L^m)$ with $(\omega, m)\in \overline{\DD}\times (\NN\setminus\{0\})$, where $L$ is a shift operator and $\DD$ denotes the open unit disc in the complex plane $\CC$. A classification of $\sT$ is given as $\sT=\sT_{\{0\}}\cup\sT_{\DD\setminus\{0\}}\cup \sT_{\partial \DD}$, where $\TA\in\sT_{\{0\}}$ and $\TG\in \sT_{\partial \DD}$. The classification is specified by a pair of parameters $(\om,m)\in\CC\times\NN$. Finally the time evolution $T_{\om,m}(t)=e^{itN} T_{\om,m}e^{-itN}$ for $T_{\om,m}\in\sT$ is investigated, and it is shown that $T_{\om,m}(t)$ is periodic with respect to~$t$.</description>

      <title>Haag-Kastler stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an alternative implementation of the principle of general local covariance for algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs) which is more flexible than the original one by Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch. This is realized by considering the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK} : \mathbf{Loc}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$ which assigns to each Lorentzian manifold $M$ the category $\mathsf{HK}(M)$ of Haag-Kastler-style AQFTs over $M$ and to each embedding $f:M\to N$ a pullback functor $f^\ast = \mathsf{HK}(f) : \mathsf{HK}(N) \to \mathsf{HK}(M)$ restricting theories from $N$ to $M$. Locally covariant AQFTs are recovered as the points of the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK}$. The main advantages of this new perspective are: 1.) It leads to technical simplifications, in particular with regard to the time-slice axiom, since global problems on $\mathbf{Loc}$ become families of simpler local problems on individual Lorentzian manifolds. 2.) Some aspects of the Haag-Kastler framework which previously got lost in locally covariant AQFT, such as a relative compactness condition on the open subsets in a Lorentzian manifold $M$, are reintroduced. 3.) It provides a radically new perspective on descent conditions in AQFT, i.e. local-to-global conditions which allow one to recover a global AQFT on a Lorentzian manifold $M$ from its local data in an open cover $\{U_i \subseteq M\}$.</description>

      <title>Double BFV quantisation of 3d Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky (BFV), which produces a resolution of coisotropic reduction in terms of hamiltonian dg manifolds, to the case of nested coisotropic embeddings $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$. To this, we naturally assign $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C_\circ}$, as well as the respective BFV dg manifolds. We show that the data of a nested coisotropic embedding defines a natural graded coisotropic embedding inside the BFV dg manifold assigned to $\underline{C}$, whose reduction can further be resolved using the BFV prescription. We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction" for a general class of nested coisotropic embeddings. We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}$, from the (graded) geometric quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold (when it exists), following the quantum BFV prescription. As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the infinite random Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain exhibits localization phenomena, such as spectral, eigenstate, and weak dynamical localization, in an arbitrary (but fixed) energy interval in a non-trivial region of the parameter space. This region depends only on the energy interval and includes weak interaction and strong disorder regimes. The crucial step in the argument is a proof that if the Green functions for the associated finite systems Hamiltonians exhibit certain (volume-dependent) decay properties in a fixed energy interval, then the infinite volume Green function decays in the same interval as well. The pertinent finite systems decay properties for the random XXZ spin chain had been previously verified by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the validity of reflection positivity in the classification of invertible phases of quantum spin systems. We provide a mathematical model in which every 2d invertible state admits a reflection-positive representative. We prove that reflection positivity provides a canonical lift from the set of invertible phases to the set of invertible phases protected by a $\mathbb{Z}/N$-rotational symmetry. Using this, we define a refined version of the index recently introduced by the author. This refined version conjecturally provides a microscopic characterization of an invariant that coincides with the chiral central charge $c_-$ when conformal field theory effectively describes the boundary modes.</description>

Abstract: We study phase transitions in the Ising model on random graphs using graph limits. We show that the critical temperatures are determined by the eigenvalues of the kernel operator associated with the graph limit. Bifurcation diagrams for Erdos-Renyi, small-world, and power-law graphs illustrate the theory. In the small-world case, we identify metastable behavior in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes.</description>

      <title>New quasi-exactly solvable systems from SUSYQM and Bethe Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schr\"odinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new, physical-space-based method for deriving the precise leading-order late-time behaviour of solutions to geometric wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds and apply it to the setting of wave equations with asymptotically inverse-square potentials on Schwarzschild black holes. This provides a useful toy model setting for introducing methods that are applicable to more general linear and nonlinear geometric wave equations, such as wave equations for electromagnetically charged scalar fields, wave equations on extremal Kerr black holes and geometric wave equations in even space dimensions, where existing proofs for deriving precise late-time asymptotics might not apply. The method we introduce relies on exploiting the spatial decay properties of time integrals of solutions to derive the existence and precise genericity properties of asymptotic late-time tails and obtain sharp, uniform decay estimates in time.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction of the fractional $\Phi^4$ Euclidean quantum field theory on $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the full subcritical regime via parabolic stochastic quantisation. Our approach is based on the use of a truncated flow equation for the effective description of the model at sufficiently small scales and on coercive estimates for the non-linear stochastic partial differential equation describing the interacting field. The measure is invariant under translations, reflection positive and has quartic exponential tails.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the Markovian approximation in the harmonic oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a central ingredient in the construction of quantum dynamics of Brownian motion which necessarily is non-Markovian. Yet, often Markovian approximations to quantum dynamics are studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the limitations of the Markovian approximation within two paradigmatic models describing a single damped harmonic oscillator. These models are governed by distinct quantum Langevin equations, although both are constructed to satisfy the same set of phenomenological criteria: the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum, the Kubo response relation, the virial theorem, and the equilibrium quantum variance. The limitations of the Markovian approximation are underscored by the classical limit, violations of the Ehrenfest theorem, the breakdown of complete and simple positivity in the reconstructed master equations, and anomalies in thermalisation behaviour. Further phenomenological differences between the two models are illustrated through their quantum relaxation dynamics and phase diagrams, derived from their reinterpretation as mean-field approximations of a many-body interacting magnet. Our analysis explicitly reveals intrinsic inconsistencies introduced by the Markovian approximation, emphasising the need for non-Markovian frameworks for a consistent description of open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>The free energy of the large-$N$ fermionic Chern$\unicode{x2013}$Simons theory in the 'temporal' gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11020v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the computational evidence for the Bose$\unicode{x2013}$Fermi duality of fundamental fields coupled to $U(N)$ Chern$\unicode{x2013}$Simons theories originates in large-$N$ calculations performed in the light-cone gauge. This gauge is ill-suited to computations in curved spacetimes, like the evaluation of the partition function on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$ for arbitrary genus $g$. In this paper, we use another gauge, the 'temporal' gauge, to set up the computation of this partition function. In the large-$N$ limit, and the special case $\Sigma_g=\mathbb{R}^2$, we take the computation through to the end by setting up and solving the gap equations, generalizing tricks explored in arXiv:1410.0558 to finite temperature. Our final results are in perfect agreement with earlier light-cone gauge results, providing a consistency check of both the formalism developed in this paper as well as previously performed light-cone gauge computations. In a follow-up paper, we will report on using our formalism to explicitly compute the partition function on $S^2 \times S^1$ for a finite-sized sphere.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the superalgebra of derivations generated by the fundamental forms on manifolds with reduced structure group. In particular, we point out a relation between the algebra of derivations of heterotic geometries that admit Killing spinors and the commutator algebra of holonomy symmetries in sigma models. We use this to propose a Lie bracket on the space of fundamental forms of all heterotic geometries with a non-compact holonomy group and present the associated derivation algebras. We also explore the extension of these results to heterotic geometries with compact holonomy groups and, more generally, to manifolds with reduced structure group. A brief review of the classification of heterotic geometries that admit Killing spinors and an extension of this classification to some heterotic inspired geometries are also included.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous nucleation for two-dimensional Kawasaki dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the third in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U&lt;0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta&gt;0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta \in (U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates, i.e., creates a critical droplet somewhere in $\Lambda_\beta$ that subsequently grows by absorbing particles from the surrounding gas.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the second paper we used the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\theta\beta}$ with $\Delta &lt; \theta &lt; 2\Delta-U$. In the present paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Theta &lt; \Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time and the tube of typical trajectories towards nucleation. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation. One of the key ingredients in the proof is an estimate showing that no information can travel between these boxes on relevant time scales.</description>

      <title>The incipient infinite cluster of the FK-Ising model in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and the susceptibility of the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical FK-Ising measure $\phi_{\beta_c}$ on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$. We construct the measure $\phi^\infty:=\lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty}\phi_{\beta_c}[\:\cdot\: |\: 0\leftrightarrow x]$ and prove it satisfies $\phi^\infty[0\leftrightarrow \infty]=1$. This corresponds to the natural candidate for the incipient infinite cluster measure of the FK-Ising model. Our proof uses a result of Lupu and Werner (Electron. Commun. Probab., 2016) that relates the FK-Ising model to the random current representation of the Ising model, together with a mixing property of random currents recently established by Aizenman and Duminil-Copin (Ann. Math., 2021). We then study the susceptibility $\chi(\beta)$ of the nearest-neighbour Ising model on $\mathbb Z^d$. When $d&gt;4$, we improve a previous result of Aizenman (Comm. Math. Phys., 1982) to obtain the existence of $A&gt;0$ such that, for $\beta&lt;\beta_c$, \begin{equation*}
  \chi(\beta)= \frac{A}{1-\beta/\beta_c}(1+o(1)), \end{equation*} where $o(1)$ tends to $0$ as $\beta$ tends to $\beta_c$. Additionally, we relate the constant $A$ to the incipient infinite cluster of the double random current.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-timelike loops in signature changing semi-Riemannian manifolds with a transverse radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Hartle and Hawking proposed the no-boundary proposal, suggesting that the universe has no beginning in the sense of a spacetime singularity or boundary. Nevertheless, there is an origin of time. Mathematically, this involves signature-type changing manifolds in which a Riemannian region smoothly transitions to a Lorentzian region across the hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ where time begins.
  We develop a coherent framework for signature changing manifolds with a degenerate yet smooth metric. Established Lorentzian tools and results are then adapted to this setting, and new definitions are introduced that carry unforeseen causal implications. A noteworthy consequence is the presence of locally time-reversing loops through every point on the hypersurface. Imposing global hyperbolicity on the Lorentzian region, we prove that for every point $p \in M$ there exists a pseudo-timelike loop self-intersecting at $p$. Equivalently, $M$ always admits a closed pseudo-timelike path around which the time direction reverses, preventing any consistent distinction between future- and past-directed vectors. To an observer near $\mathcal{H}$, such loops may appear as the creation of a particle-antiparticle pair at two distinct points.</description>

      <title>Height-offset variables and pinning at infinity for gradient Gibbs measures on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Height-offset variables (HOVs) provide a mechanism, known as "pinning at infinity", to lift gradient Gibbs measures (GGMs) - describing interface increments - to proper Gibbs measures that describe absolute heights. Starting from Sheffield's seminal framework, we study HOVs for nearest-neighbor integer-valued gradient models on regular trees, under broad classes of transfer operators requiring only finite second moments and without assuming convexity. We first establish the existence of HOVs as martingale limits, prove the infinite differentiability of their Lebesgue densities, and demonstrate exponential concentration for the associated pinned Gibbs measures. Next we uncover a fundamental trade-off, as the Gibbs measures arising by "pinning at infinity" paradoxically lose several desirable structural properties. We rigorously show that they lose tree-automorphism invariance, the tree-indexed Markov chain property, and extremality within the class of Gibbs measures. Our analysis relies on martingale theory, novel past- and future-tail decompositions, and infinite product representations for moment generating functions, and it applies to free GGMs, as well as to GGMs of height-period two.</description>

      <title>A new class of semiclassical gravity solutions, gravitational quantum stealths and regular Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling $\xi = 1/2$. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the semiclassical system is quasi-linear hyperbolic and, within this class, provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassical gravity without spacetime symmetries. These two-point functions yield stress-energy expectation values proportional to the spacetime metric (modulo ambiguities). If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Integral representation of solutions to initial-boundary value problems in the framework of the Guyer-Krumhansl heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and Guyer-Krumhansl constitutive equation. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method. To illustrate the final formulae, we consider a numerical example for a special case in which heat exchange at one of the boundaries obeys Newton's law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the singular limit of Fokker-Planck equation of polymers density as the dominant time-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero. Here, we complete the study of Flandoli-Tahraoui[arXiv:2410.00520] about scaling limit as the space-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero by using stochastic modeling of turbulence. Depending on certain parameters related to turbulence modeling, the limit density has generalized Cauchy distribution for the end-to-end vector. We discuss also the limit when we don't have a probability density limit. Our approach is based on the derivation of an appropriate estimates on $L^2$ with appropriate weight and investigate the convergence.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06248v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial integrability in phase-oscillator dynamics is typically examined for identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the precise connectivity conditions that ensure conserved quantities on general networks remain unclear. Using Koopman theory, we rigorously derive conditions for the existence of distinct conserved quantities in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, and signed graph. In the process, we establish a criterion for Lie symmetries in general dynamical systems in terms of the Koopman generator, allowing us to identify symmetries that generate new conserved quantities. These results reveal a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities and we detect these motifs in hundreds of complex empirical networks. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks and reveal new possibilities for preserving phase relationships over time in complex systems through a careful design of their structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for general convolution approximations to a large class of log-correlated Gaussian fields, the properly normalised supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures converge stably to a nontrivial limit. This limit depends on the choice of regularisation only through a multiplicative constant and can be characterised as an integrated atomic measure with a random intensity expressed in terms of the critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce local blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Phenomenological study of Quantum-gravity effects is introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy for locally squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the Black Hole S-Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the analytic structure of the S-matrix in the complex-frequency plane for classical wave scattering on a Schwarzschild background in four space-time dimensions. Our argument relies on the analytic continuation of the gravitational potential, with the singularity behind the horizon playing a crucial role. We find that in the lower half-plane the partial-wave amplitudes are analytic except for the quasinormal-mode poles and the branch cut associated with late-time tails. As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane. We also determine the effect of infrared (IR) regulators on the analytic structure, showing that polynomial boundedness requires a sharp lower bound on the IR cutoff in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a surface observable for nonabelian four-dimensional $BF$ theory with a cosmological term. The surface observable yields new $2$-knot invariants that may extend beyond known examples such as the Alexander invariant. By BV pushforward, the surface observable induces an electric observable in nonabelian Yang-Mills theory, offering a concrete realization of 't~Hooft operators. An application to self-dual Yang-Mills theory is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities without invoking any SymTFT construction, relying instead on a purely 2d RCFT analysis. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</description>
