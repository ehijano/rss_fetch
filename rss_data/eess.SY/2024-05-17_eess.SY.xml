      <title>Structural Impact of Grid-Forming Inverters on Power System Coherency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the following fundamental research question: how does the integration of grid-forming inverters (GFMs) replacing conventional synchronous generators (SGs) impact the slow coherent eigen-structure and the low-frequency oscillatory behavior of future power systems? Due to time-scale separated dynamics, generator states inside a coherent area synchronize over a fast time-scale due to stronger coupling, while the areas themselves synchronize over a slower time scale. Our mathematical analysis shows that due to the large-scale integration of GFMs, the weighted Laplacian structure of the frequency dynamics is preserved, however, the entries of the Laplacian may be significantly modified based on the location and penetration levels of the GFMs. This can impact and potentially significantly alter the coherency structure of the system. We have validated our findings with numerical results using the IEEE 68-bus test system.</description>

      <title>Adaptive tracking MPC for nonlinear systems via online linear system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive tracking model predictive control (MPC) scheme to control unknown nonlinear systems based on an adaptively estimated linear model. The model is determined based on linear system identification using a moving window of past measurements, and it serves as a local approximation of the underlying nonlinear dynamics. We prove that the presented scheme ensures practical exponential stability of the (unknown) optimal reachable equilibrium for a given output setpoint. Finally, we apply the proposed scheme in simulation and compare it to an alternative direct data-driven MPC scheme based on the Fundamental Lemma.</description>

      <title>Collaborative planning of integrated hydrogen energy chain multi-energy systems: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most planning of the traditional hydrogen energy supply chain (HSC) focuses on the storage and transportation links between production and consumption ends. It ignores the energy flows and interactions between each link, making it unsuitable for energy system planning analysis. Therefore, we propose the concept of a hydrogen energy chain (HEC) based on the HSC, which emphasizes the interactions between different types of energy flows in the production, compression, storage, transportation, and application links of hydrogen. The HEC plays a crucial role in mitigating fluctuations of renewable energy and facilitating the optimal allocation of heterogeneous energy sources across time and space. Effective collaborative planning models that consider HEC are essential for the optimal configuration of multi-energy systems (MESs), which guarantees high-efficiency operation and the economic and environmental friendliness of the system. This paper presents a systematic review of recent articles on collaborative planning of integrated hydrogen energy chain multi-energy systems (HEC-MESs). First, we introduce the basic framework of HEC-MES, focusing on the current research status of the production, compression, storage, transportation, and application links in HEC. Furthermore, we review technology types of hydrogen energy for planning and summarize the typical forms of HEC in MESs. Then, the following sections outline the models and methods for collaborative planning of HEC-MES. They include detailed analyses of covered sector types, spatial and temporal scopes of planning, uncertainties, model formulations, and solution methods. Finally, the paper concludes by summarizing the research gaps identified in current articles and outlining directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Introducing advanced hybrid coupling: Non-discriminatory coalescence of flow-based and net transfer capacity calculation regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based market coupling is substantially altering the computation of cross-zonal capacities for the trade of electricity in the vast majority of European markets. The main benefit of the flow-based method is improved accuracy by better representing the impact of cross-zonal trade on the power flows in transmission grids. Some borders, adjacent to flow-based capacity regions, are represented through net transfer capacities during market coupling. Under the current standard hybrid coupling, the utilization of grid elements in the flow-based regions due to the predicted trade across such borders is not available for trades between flow-based zones. The flow-based representation is not limited to the given capacity calculation region, but can be extended to also model the impact of trade with other regions. This so-called advanced hybrid coupling replaces the priority inherently given to trade across net transfer capacity-coupled borders by introducing virtual bidding zones. These map the effect of non-flow-based borders on line capacities in the flow-based regions, enabling the market coupling optimization to prioritize trade between flow-based bidding zones and trade across non-flow-based borders. This paper explains the mechanism of advanced hybrid coupling and how it is modeled mathematically. Based on a test network, a case study shows to what extent and why advanced hybrid coupling leads to welfare gains during market coupling and lower congestion management costs in the flow-based region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note aims to provide a systematic understanding of direct data-driven control, enriching the existing literature not by adding another isolated result, but rather by offering a comprehensive, versatile, and unifying framework that sets the stage for future explorations and applications in this domain. To this end, we formulate the nonlinear design problem from a high-level perspective as a set of desired controlled systems and propose systematic procedures to synthesize data-driven control algorithms that meet the design requirements specified in the desired set. Various examples are presented to demonstrate the comprehensiveness and adaptability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Energy Efficiency in O-RAN Through Intelligent xApps Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of 5G technology presents an unprecedented challenge in managing the energy consumption of densely deployed network infrastructures, particularly Base Stations (BSs), which account for the majority of power usage in mobile networks. The O-RAN architecture, with its emphasis on open and intelligent design, offers a promising framework to address the Energy Efficiency (EE) demands of modern telecommunication systems. This paper introduces two xApps designed for the O-RAN architecture to optimize power savings without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS). Utilizing a commercial RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) simulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed xApps through extensive simulations that reflect real-world operational conditions. Our results show a significant reduction in power consumption, achieving up to 50% power savings with a minimal number of User Equipments (UEs), by intelligently managing the operational state of Radio Cards (RCs), particularly through switching between active and sleep modes based on network resource block usage conditions.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman Operator-Informed Safety Command Governor for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of nonlinear behaviors with physical-based models poses challenges. However, Koopman operator maps the original nonlinear system into an infinite-dimensional linear space to achieve global linearization of the nonlinear system through input and output data, which derives an absolute equivalent linear representation of the original state space. Due to the impossibility of implementing the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator, finite-dimensional kernel functions are selected as an approximation. Given its flexible structure and high accuracy, deep learning is initially employed to extract kernel functions from data and acquire a linear evolution dynamic of the autonomous vehicle in the lifted space. Additionally, the control barrier function (CBF) converts the state constraints to the constraints on the input to render safety property. Then, in terms of the lateral stability of the in-wheel motor driven vehicle, the CBF conditions are incorporated with the learned deep Koopman model. Because of the linear fashion of the deep Koopman model, the quadratic programming problem is formulated to generate the applied driving torque with minimal perturbation to the original driving torque as a safety command governor. In the end, to validate the fidelity of the deep Koopman model compared to other mainstream approaches and demonstrate the lateral improvement achieved by the proposed safety command governor, data collection and safety testing scenarios are conducted on a hardware-in-the-loop platform.</description>

      <title>Incorporating ESO into Deep Koopman Operator Modelling for Control of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory is a kind of data-driven modelling approach that accurately captures the nonlinearities of mechatronic systems such as vehicles against physics-based methods. However, the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator is impossible to implement in real-world applications. To approximate the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator through collection dataset rather than manual trial and error, we adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract basis functions by offline training and map the nonlinearities of vehicle planar dynamics into a linear form in the lifted space. Besides, the effects of the dimensions of basis functions on the model accuracy are explored. Further, the extended state observer (ESO) is introduced to online estimate the total disturbance in the lifted space and compensate for the modelling errors and residuals of the learned deep Koopman operator (DK) while also improving its generalization. Then, the proposed model is applied to predict vehicle states within prediction horizons and later formulates the constrained finite-time optimization problem of model predictive control (MPC), i.e., ESO-DKMPC. In terms of the trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles, the ESO-DKMPC generates the wheel steering angle to govern lateral motions based on the decoupling control structure. The various conditions under the double-lane change scenarios are built on the CarSim/Simulink co-simulation platform, and extensive comparisons are conducted with the linear MPC (LMPC) and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) informed by the physics-based model. The results indicate that the proposed ESO-DKMPC has better tracking performance and moderate efficacy both within linear and nonlinear regions.</description>

      <title>Restless Bandit Problem with Rewards Generated by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit problem studies decision-making under uncertainty. In the problem, the learner interacts with an environment by choosing an action at each round, where a round is an instance of an interaction. In response, the environment reveals a reward, which is sampled from a stochastic process, to the learner. The goal of the learner is to maximize cumulative reward. A specific variation of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem is the restless bandit, where the reward for each action is sampled from a Markov chain. The restless bandit with a discrete state-space is a well-studied problem, but to the best of our knowledge, not many results exist for the continuous state-space version which has many applications such as hyperparameter optimization. In this work, we tackle the restless bandit with continuous state-space by assuming the rewards are the inner product of an action vector and a state vector generated by a linear Gaussian dynamical system. To predict the reward for each action, we propose a method that takes a linear combination of previously observed rewards for predicting each action's next reward. We show that, regardless of the sequence of previous actions chosen, the reward sampled for any previously chosen action can be used for predicting another action's future reward, i.e. the reward sampled for action 1 at round $t-1$ can be used for predicting the reward for action $2$ at round $t$. This is accomplished by designing a modified Kalman filter with a matrix representation that can be learned for reward prediction. Numerical evaluations are carried out on a set of linear Gaussian dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fusion Intelligence (FI), a bio-inspired intelligent system, where the innate sensing, intelligence and unique actuation abilities of biological organisms such as bees and ants are integrated with the computational power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This interdisciplinary field seeks to create systems that are not only smart but also adaptive and responsive in ways that mimic the nature. As FI evolves, it holds the promise of revolutionizing the way we approach complex problems, leveraging the best of both biological and digital worlds to create solutions that are more effective, sustainable, and harmonious with the environment. We demonstrate FI's potential to enhance agricultural IoT system performance through a simulated case study on improving insect pollination efficacy (entomophily).</description>

      <title>Human-AI Safety: A Descendant of Generative AI and Control Systems Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is interacting with people at an unprecedented scale, offering new avenues for immense positive impact, but also raising widespread concerns around the potential for individual and societal harm. Today, the predominant paradigm for human-AI safety focuses on fine-tuning the generative model's outputs to better agree with human-provided examples or feedback. In reality, however, the consequences of an AI model's outputs cannot be determined in an isolated context: they are tightly entangled with the responses and behavior of human users over time. In this position paper, we argue that meaningful safety assurances for these AI technologies can only be achieved by reasoning about how the feedback loop formed by the AI's outputs and human behavior may drive the interaction towards different outcomes. To this end, we envision a high-value window of opportunity to bridge the rapidly growing capabilities of generative AI and the dynamical safety frameworks from control theory, laying a new foundation for human-centered AI safety in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Predicting Solar Heat Production to Optimize Renewable Energy Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing solar energy to meet space heating and domestic hot water demand is very efficient (in terms of environmental footprint as well as cost), but in order to ensure that user demand is entirely covered throughout the year needs to be complemented with auxiliary heating systems, typically boilers and heat pumps. Naturally, the optimal control of such a system depends on an accurate prediction of solar thermal production.
  Experimental testing and physics-based numerical models are used to find a collector's performance curve - the mapping from solar radiation and other external conditions to heat production - but this curve changes over time once the collector is exposed to outdoor conditions. In order to deploy advanced control strategies in small domestic installations, we present an approach that uses machine learning to automatically construct and continuously adapt a model that predicts heat production. Our design is driven by the need to (a) construct and adapt models using supervision that can be extracted from low-cost instrumentation, avoiding extreme accuracy and reliability requirements; and (b) at inference time, use inputs that are typically provided in publicly available weather forecasts.
  Recent developments in attention-based machine learning, as well as careful adaptation of the training setup to the specifics of the task, have allowed us to design a machine learning-based solution that covers our requirements. We present positive empirical results for the predictive accuracy of our solution, and discuss the impact of these results on the end-to-end system.</description>

Abstract: Propagation modeling is a crucial tool for successful wireless deployments and spectrum planning with the demand for high modeling accuracy continuing to grow. Recognizing that detailed knowledge of the physical environment (terrain and clutter) is essential, we propose a novel approach that uses environmental information for predictions. Instead of relying on complex, detail-intensive models, we explore the use of simplified scalar features involving the total obstruction depth along the direct path from transmitter to receiver. Obstacle depth offers a streamlined, yet surprisingly accurate, method for predicting wireless signal propagation, providing a practical solution for efficient and effective wireless network planning.</description>

      <title>A finite-sample generalization bound for stable LPV systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main theoretical challenges in learning dynamical systems from data is providing upper bounds on the generalization error, that is, the difference between the expected prediction error and the empirical prediction error measured on some finite sample. In machine learning, a popular class of such bounds are the so-called Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds. In this paper, we derive a PAC bound for stable continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. Our bound depends on the H2 norm of the chosen class of the LPV systems, but does not depend on the time interval for which the signals are considered.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributed attitude estimation of multi-agent systems, evolving on $SO(3)$, relying on individual angular velocity and relative attitude measurements. The interaction graph topology is assumed to be an undirected tree. First, we propose a continuous nonlinear distributed attitude estimation scheme with almost global asymptotic stability guarantees. Thereafter, we proceed with the \textit{hybridization} of the proposed estimation scheme to derive a new hybrid nonlinear distributed attitude estimation scheme enjoying global asymptotic stabilization of the attitude estimation errors to a common constant orientation. In addition, the proposed hybrid attitude estimation scheme is used to solve the problem of pose estimation of $N$-vehicles navigating in a three-dimensional space, with global asymptotic stability guarantees, where the only available measurements are the local relative bearings and the individual linear velocities. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation schemes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding an input signal which transfers a linear boundary controlled 1D parabolic partial differential equation with spatially-varying coefficients from a given initial state to a desired final state. The initial and final states have certain smoothness and the transfer must occur over a given time interval. We address this motion planning problem by first discretizing the spatial derivatives in the parabolic equation using the finite-difference approximation to obtain a linear ODE in time. Then using the flatness approach we construct an input signal that transfers this ODE between states determined by the initial and final states of the parabolic equation. We prove that, as the discretization step size converges to zero, this input signal converges to a limiting input signal which can perform the desired transfer for the parabolic equation. While earlier works have applied this motion planning approach to constant coefficient parabolic equations, this is the first work to investigate and establish the efficacy of this approach for parabolic equations with discontinuous spatially-varying coefficients. Using this approach we can construct input signals which transfer the parabolic equation from one steady-state to another. We show that this approach yields a new proof for the null controllability of 1D linear parabolic equations containing discontinuous coefficients and also present a numerical scheme for constructing a null control input signal when the initial state is piecewise continuous.</description>

      <title>Robust Multivariate Detection and Estimation with Fault Frequency Content Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of fault detection and estimation (FDE) for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with a particular focus on frequency content information of faults, possibly as multiple disjoint continuum ranges, and under both disturbances and stochastic noise. To ensure the worst-case fault sensitivity in the considered frequency ranges and mitigate the effects of disturbances and noise, an optimization framework incorporating a mixed H_/H2 performance index is developed to compute the optimal detection filter. Moreover, a thresholding rule is proposed to guarantee both the false alarm rate (FAR) and the fault detection rate (FDR). Next, shifting attention to fault estimation in specific frequency ranges, an exact reformulation of the optimal estimation filter design using the restricted Hinf performance index is derived, which is inherently non-convex. However, focusing on finite frequency samples and fixed poles, a lower bound is established via a highly tractable quadratic programming (QP) problem. This lower bound together with an alternating optimization (AO) approach to the original estimation problem leads to a suboptimality gap for the overall estimation filter design. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated through a synthetic non-minimum phase system and an application of the multi-area power system.</description>

      <title>Blind System Identification in Linear Parameter-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind System Identification (BSI) is used to extract a system model whenever input data is not attainable. Therefore, the input data and system model should be estimated simultaneously. Because of nonlinearities in a large number of systems, BSI problem is usually challenging to solve. In this paper, an innovative solution is proposed to deal with the BSI problem in nonlinear systems using the properties of the Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). More specifically, assuming scheduling variable is not measurable, the dynamic of the LPV system is approximated. To solve the BSI problem in this context, LPV structure is modeled as an HMM network and a modified Quasi-Static combination of Viterbi and Baum-Welch algorithms (QSVBW) is proposed to estimate the nonlinear mappings and scheduling variable signal. The applicability and the performance of the suggested QSVBW algorithm has been justified by numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data-Driven MPC for Demand Response of Commercial Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to significantly improve the energy efficiency of buildings while maintaining thermal comfort. Data-driven approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to facilitate system modelling. However, such approaches are generally nonconvex and result in computationally intractable optimization problems. In this work, we design a readily implementable energy management method for small commercial buildings. We then leverage our approach to formulate a real-time demand bidding strategy. We propose a data-driven and mixed-integer convex MPC which is solved via derivative-free optimization given a limited computational time of 5 minutes to respect operational constraints. We consider rooftop unit heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems with discrete controls to accurately model the operation of most commercial buildings. Our approach uses an input convex recurrent neural network to model the thermal dynamics. We apply our approach in several demand response (DR) settings, including a demand bidding, a time-of-use, and a critical peak rebate program. Controller performance is evaluated on a state-of-the-art building simulation. The proposed approach improves thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption and cost through DR participation, when compared to other data-driven approaches or a set-point controller.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Multi-Rotor Landing on Moving Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-rotor UAVs suffer from a restricted range and flight duration due to limited battery capacity. Autonomous landing on a 2D moving platform offers the possibility to replenish batteries and offload data, thus increasing the utility of the vehicle. Classical approaches rely on accurate, complex and difficult-to-derive models of the vehicle and the environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an attractive alternative due to its ability to learn a suitable control policy exclusively from data during a training procedure. However, current methods require several hours to train, have limited success rates and depend on hyperparameters that need to be tuned by trial-and-error. We address all these issues in this work. First, we decompose the landing procedure into a sequence of simpler, but similar learning tasks. This is enabled by applying two instances of the same RL based controller trained for 1D motion for controlling the multi-rotor's movement in both the longitudinal and the lateral directions. Second, we introduce a powerful state space discretization technique that is based on i) kinematic modeling of the moving platform to derive information about the state space topology and ii) structuring the training as a sequential curriculum using transfer learning. Third, we leverage the kinematics model of the moving platform to also derive interpretable hyperparameters for the training process that ensure sufficient maneuverability of the multi-rotor vehicle. The training is performed using the tabular RL method Double Q-Learning. Through extensive simulations we show that the presented method significantly increases the rate of successful landings, while requiring less training time compared to other deep RL approaches. Finally, we deploy and demonstrate our algorithm on real hardware. For all evaluation scenarios we provide statistics on the agent's performance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Infused Distributed Optimization for Coordinating Virtual Power Plant Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amid the increasing interest in the deployment of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) has emerged as a pivotal tool for aggregating diverse DERs and facilitating their participation in wholesale energy markets. These VPP deployments have been fueled by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 2222, which makes DERs and VPPs competitive across market segments. However, the diversity and decentralized nature of DERs present significant challenges to the scalable coordination of VPP assets. To address efficiency and speed bottlenecks, this paper presents a novel machine learning-assisted distributed optimization to coordinate VPP assets. Our method, named LOOP-MAC(Learning to Optimize the Optimization Process for Multi-agent Coordination), adopts a multi-agent coordination perspective where each VPP agent manages multiple DERs and utilizes neural network approximators to expedite the solution search. The LOOP-MAC method employs a gauge map to guarantee strict compliance with local constraints, effectively reducing the need for additional post-processing steps. Our results highlight the advantages of LOOP-MAC, showcasing accelerated solution times per iteration and significantly reduced convergence times. The LOOP-MAC method outperforms conventional centralized and distributed optimization methods in optimization tasks that require repetitive and sequential execution.</description>

      <title>ViKi-HyCo: A Hybrid-Control approach for complex car-like maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Visual Servoing is deeply studied to perform simple maneuvers, the literature does not commonly address complex cases where the target is far out of the camera's field of view (FOV) during the maneuver. For this reason, in this paper, we present ViKi-HyCo (Visual Servoing and Kinematic Hybrid-Controller). This approach generates the necessary maneuvers for the complex positioning of a non-holonomic mobile robot in outdoor environments. In this method, we use \hbox{LiDAR-camera} fusion to estimate objects bounding boxes using image and metrics modalities. With the multi-modality nature of our representation, we can automatically obtain a target for a visual servoing controller. At the same time, we also have a metric target, which allows us to hybridize with a kinematic controller. Given this hybridization, we can perform complex maneuvers even when the target is far away from the camera's FOV. The proposed approach does not require an object-tracking algorithm and can be applied to any robotic positioning task where its kinematic model is known. ViKi-HyCo has an error of 0.0428 \pm 0.0467 m in the X-axis and 0.0515 \pm 0.0323 m in the Y-axis at the end of a complete positioning task.</description>

      <title>Slice-aware Resource Allocation and Admission Control for Smart Factory Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) and beyond network offers substantial promise as the ideal wireless technology to replace the existing inflexible wired connections in traditional factories of today. 5G network slicing allows for tailored allocation of resources to different network services, each with unique Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a novel solution for slice-aware radio resource allocation based on a convex optimisation control framework for applications in smart factory wireless networks. The proposed framework dynamically allocates minimum power and sub-channels to downlink mixed service type industrial users categorised into three slices: Capacity Limited (CL), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Time Sensitive (TS) slices. Given that the base station (BS) has limited transmission power, we enforce admission control by effectively relaxing the target rate constraints for current connections in the CL slice. This rate readjustment occurs whenever power consumption exceeds manageable levels. Simulation results show that our approach minimises power, allocates sub-channels to users, maintains slice isolation, and delivers QoS-specific communications to users in all the slices despite time-varying number of users and changing network conditions.</description>
