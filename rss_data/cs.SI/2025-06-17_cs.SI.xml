      <title>Density-aware Walks for Coordinated Campaign Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated campaigns frequently exploit social media platforms by artificially amplifying topics, making inauthentic trends appear organic, and misleading users into engagement. Distinguishing these coordinated efforts from genuine public discourse remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of such attacks. Our work focuses on detecting coordinated campaigns by modeling the problem as a graph classification task. We leverage the recently introduced Large Engagement Networks (LEN) dataset, which contains over 300 networks capturing engagement patterns from both fake and authentic trends on Twitter prior to the 2023 Turkish elections. The graphs in LEN were constructed by collecting interactions related to campaigns that stemmed from ephemeral astroturfing. Established graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to accurately classify campaign graphs, highlighting the challenges posed by LEN due to the large size of its networks. To address this, we introduce a new graph classification method that leverages the density of local network structures. We propose a random weighted walk (RWW) approach in which node transitions are biased by local density measures such as degree, core number, or truss number. These RWWs are encoded using the Skip-gram model, producing density-aware structural embeddings for the nodes. Training message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) on these density-aware embeddings yields superior results compared to the simpler node features available in the dataset, with nearly a 12\% and 5\% improvement in accuracy for binary and multiclass classification, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating density-aware structural encoding with MPNNs provides a robust framework for identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media networks such as Twitter.</description>

      <title>AMLgentex: Mobilizing Data-Driven Research to Combat Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by allowing illicit funds to enter the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, only a small fraction is ever uncovered. This stems from a range of factors, including deliberate evasion by launderers, the rarity of confirmed cases, and the limited visibility each financial institution has into the global transaction network. While several synthetic datasets are available, they fail to model the structural and behavioral complexity of real-world money laundering. In particular, they often overlook partial observability, sparse and uncertain labels, strategic behavior, temporal dynamics, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. To address these limitations, we present AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. It enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering (AML) systems in a controlled environment that captures key real-world challenges. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to rigorously evaluate methods under conditions that reflect the complexity of practical AML scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Precinct and District Voting Data Using Persistent Homology to Identify Gerrymandering in North Carolina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of Feng and Porter's 2019 paper on the use of the level-set method for the construction of a filtered simplicial complex from geospatial election data. Precincts are regarded to be too small to be gerrymandered, allowing us to identify discrepancies between precinct and district level voting data to quantify gerrymandering in the United States. Comparing the persistent homologies of Democratic voting areas on the precinct and district level shows when areas have been 'cracked' or 'packed' for partisan gain. This analysis was done for North Carolina House of Representatives elections (2012 to 2024). North Carolina has been redistricted 4 times in the past 10 years, whereas most states redistrict decennially, allowing us to understand how and when redistricted maps deviate from precinct-level voting data, and when gerrymandering occurs. Comparing persistence barcodes at the precinct and district levels (using the bottleneck distance) shows that precinct-level voting patterns do not significantly fluctuate biannually, while district level patterns do, suggesting that shifts are likely a result of redistricting rather than voter behavior, providing strong evidence of gerrymandering. North Carolina election data was collected from the public domain. Composite shapefiles were created using QGIS and R, and rasterized using Python. The level-set method was employed to generate filtered simplicial complexes. Persistence barcodes were produced using GUDHI and PHAT libraries. Additionally, we compare our results with traditional measures such as Polsby-Popper and Reock scores (gerrymandering identification measures). This research presents a novel application of topological data analysis in evaluating gerrymandering.</description>

      <title>BotTrans: A Multi-Source Graph Domain Adaptation Approach for Social Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transferring extensive knowledge from relevant social networks has emerged as a promising solution to overcome label scarcity in detecting social bots and other anomalies with GNN-based models. However, effective transfer faces two critical challenges. Firstly, the network heterophily problem, which is caused by bots hiding malicious behaviors via indiscriminately interacting with human users, hinders the model's ability to learn sufficient and accurate bot-related knowledge from source domains. Secondly, single-source transfer might lead to inferior and unstable results, as the source network may embody weak relevance to the task and provide limited knowledge. To address these challenges, we explore multiple source domains and propose a multi-source graph domain adaptation model named \textit{BotTrans}. We initially leverage the labeling knowledge shared across multiple source networks to establish a cross-source-domain topology with increased network homophily. We then aggregate cross-domain neighbor information to enhance the discriminability of source node embeddings. Subsequently, we integrate the relevance between each source-target pair with model optimization, which facilitates knowledge transfer from source networks that are more relevant to the detection task. Additionally, we propose a refinement strategy to improve detection performance by utilizing semantic knowledge within the target domain. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that \textit{BotTrans} outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, revealing its efficacy in leveraging multi-source knowledge when the target detection task is unlabeled.</description>

      <title>High Socioeconomic Status is Associated with Diverse Consumption across Brands and Price Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consumption practices are determined by a combination of economic, social, and cultural forces. We posit that lower economic constraints leave more room to diversify consumption along cultural and social aspects in the form of omnivorous or lifestyle-based niche consumption. We provide empirical evidence for this diversity hypothesis by analysing millions of mobile-tracked visits from thousands of Census Block Groups to thousands of stores in New York State. The results show that high income is significantly associated with diverse consumption across brands and price levels. The associations between diversity and income persist but are less prominent for necessity-based consumption and for the densely populated and demographically diverse New York City. The associations replicate for education as an alternative measure of socioeconomic status and for the state of Texas. We further illustrate that the associations cannot be explained by simple geographic constraints, including the neighbourhoods' demographic diversity, the residents' geographic mobility and the stores' local availability, so deeper social and cultural factors must be at play.</description>

      <title>The Redundancy of Full Nodes in Bitcoin: A Network-Theoretic Demonstration of Miner-Centric Propagation Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper formally examines the network structure of Bitcoin CORE (BTC) and Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) using complex graph theory to demonstrate that home-hosted full nodes are incapable of participating in or influencing the propagation topology. Leveraging established models such as scale-free networks and small-world connectivity, we demonstrate that the propagation graph is dominated by a densely interconnected miner clique, while full nodes reside on the periphery, excluded from all transaction-to-block inclusion paths. Using simulation-backed metrics and eigenvalue centrality analysis, we confirm that full nodes are neither critical nor operationally relevant for consensus propagation.</description>

      <title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</description>

      <title>Bridging Social Media and Search Engines: Dredge Words and the Detection of Unreliable Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proactive content moderation requires platforms to rapidly and continuously evaluate the credibility of websites. Leveraging the direct and indirect paths users follow to unreliable websites, we develop a website credibility classification and discovery system that integrates both webgraph and large-scale social media contexts. We additionally introduce the concept of dredge words, terms or phrases for which unreliable domains rank highly on search engines, and provide the first exploration of their usage on social media. Our graph neural networks that combine webgraph and social media contexts generate to state-of-the-art results in website credibility classification and significantly improves the top-k identification of unreliable domains. Additionally, we release a novel dataset of dredge words, highlighting their strong connections to both social media and online commerce platforms.</description>

      <title>A Model of Silence, or the Probability of "Un Ange Passe"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In French, the phrase "Un ange passe" ("An angel passes") refers to the sudden silence that falls over a co-present group -- that is, a group of people sharing the same physical space. As evidenced by the presence of similar expressions across languages and cultures, this phenomenon represents a universal feature of human conversation. At the same time, the meaning attributed to silence can differ greatly across national, cultural, and interpersonal contexts. Consequently, a wide range of studies have focused on the impact of silence on organizational productivity, its relationship to ideas and creativity, and its potential effectiveness in medical settings. Despite the important role that silence plays, very few studies have attempted to characterize its features using mathematical modeling. In this study, we propose a Markov chain model to describe the dynamics of silence in a co-present group and attempt to analyze its behavior. Our results reveal a phase-transition-like phenomenon, where the probability of silence abruptly drops to zero once individuals' awareness of the surrounding conversation falls below a critical threshold. In other words, such silence can emerge only when individuals retain a minimal degree of mutual awareness of those around them. The model proposed in this study not only offers a deeper understanding of conversational dynamics, but also holds potential for contributing to intercultural communication, organizational productivity, and medical practice.</description>

      <title>Privacy Intelligence: A Survey on Image Privacy in Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12199v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image sharing on online social networks (OSNs) has become an indispensable part of daily social activities, but it has also led to an increased risk of privacy invasion. The recent image leaks from popular OSN services and the abuse of personal photos using advanced algorithms (e.g. DeepFake) have prompted the public to rethink individual privacy needs in OSN image sharing. However, OSN image privacy itself is quite complicated, and solutions currently in place for privacy management in reality are insufficient to provide personalized, accurate and flexible privacy protection. A more intelligent environment for privacy-friendly OSN image sharing is in demand. To fill the gap, we contribute a survey of "privacy intelligence" that targets modern privacy issues in dynamic OSN image sharing from a user-centric perspective. Specifically, we present a definition and a taxonomy of OSN image privacy, and a high-level privacy analysis framework based on the lifecycle of OSN image sharing. The framework consists of three stages with different principles of privacy by design. At each stage, we identify typical user behaviors in OSN image sharing and the privacy issues associated with these behaviors. Then a systematic review on the representative intelligent solutions targeting those privacy issues is conducted, also in a stage-based manner. The resulting analysis describes an intelligent privacy firewall for closed-loop privacy management. We also discuss the challenges and future directions in this area.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks for Multi-Label Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-label node classification is an important yet under-explored domain in graph mining as many real-world nodes belong to multiple categories rather than just a single one. Although a few efforts have been made by utilizing Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) to learn node representations and model correlations between multiple labels in the embedding space, they still suffer from the ambiguous feature and ambiguous topology induced by multiple labels, which reduces the credibility of the messages delivered in graphs and overlooks the label correlations on graph data. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the ambiguity and empower the GCNs for accurate classification. However, this is quite challenging due to the requirement of retaining the distinctiveness of each label while fully harnessing the correlation between labels simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Correlation-aware Graph Convolutional Network (CorGCN) for multi-label node classification. By introducing a novel Correlation-Aware Graph Decomposition module, CorGCN can learn a graph that contains rich label-correlated information for each label. It then employs a Correlation-Enhanced Graph Convolution to model the relationships between labels during message passing to further bolster the classification process. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CorGCN.</description>
