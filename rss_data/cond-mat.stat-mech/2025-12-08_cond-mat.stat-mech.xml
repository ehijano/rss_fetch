      <title>Thermal stability originates the vanishing of the specific heats at the absolute zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05129v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}&gt;0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review and compare some frameworks for dissipation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We start with a brief overview of classical irreversible thermodynamics and gradient dynamics. Then we discuss several specific frameworks including Rayleigh dissipation potential and the dissipative d'Alembert framework, showing their relations with gradient dynamics. Finally, we discuss frameworks for dissipative evolution generated from Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hysteresis and transitions induced by potential asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of an external periodic field in a bistable system gives rise to a very interesting phenomenon of dynamic hysteresis, which has extensive applications in technologies. Environmental noise also has a crucial role in controlling this class of hysteresis. The relaxational delay of the system's response towards the periodic drive manifests in the response function-field hysteresis loops. These hysteresis loops are generally symmetric in the range of the external force and the response function. Symmetry breaking is observed under extreme conditions of the noise strength, amplitude and frequency of the periodic force. This symmetric-asymmetric dynamic transition is interpreted in terms of the relevant order parameter defined for the system under study. In our present work, we importantly identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in the hysteresis loops, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions as well if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. We develop a quantitative understanding of the variation of the hysteresis loop area and the order parameter with respect to the degree of asymmetry in the potential. Our study suggests an ingenious way to get the desired outputs in the processes related to dynamic hysteresis by effectively controlling the asymmetry of the intrinsic potential governing the dynamics. These findings not only direct a new and impactful path for technological advances involving hysteresis but also provide the basic understanding of the precise role of the underlying potential in regulating this fundamental process, which manifests frequently in natural and designed systems.</description>

      <title>Observation-Time-Induced Crossover from Fluctuating Diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical transition -- seen as a sudden increase in the mean-squared displacement at a characteristic temperature that depends on the observation time -- is widely reported in neutron-scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated proteins. However, its physical origin remains elusive. We show that fluctuating diffusivity in a Langevin framework leads to an observation-time-induced crossover, where the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits a temperature-dependent transition whose crossover point shifts with observation time. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal the mechanism of this crossover and delineate the conditions under which it emerges. Our findings provide a unified nonequilibrium interpretation for observation-time-induced crossover, and suggest that the protein dynamical transition can be viewed as an instance of this general crossover mechanism.</description>

      <title>Sticky eigenstates in systems with sharply-divided phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate mixed eigenstates in systems with sharply-divided phase space, using different piecewise-linear maps whose regular-chaotic boundaries are formed by marginally unstable periodic orbits (MUPOs) or by quasi-periodic orbits. With the overlap index and the entropy localization length, we classify mixed eigenstates and show that the contribution from dynamical tunneling scales as $\sim \hbar\, \exp(-b/\hbar)$, with $b&gt;0$ associated with the relative size of the regular region. The dominant fraction of states that remain sticky to the boundaries, referred to as sticky eigenstates, scales as $\hbar^{1/2}$ in the MUPO case and oscillates around this algebraic behavior in the quasi-periodic case. This behavior generalizes established predictions for hierarchical states in KAM systems, which scale as $\hbar^{1 - 1/\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ set by the corresponding classical stickiness reflected in the algebraic decay of cumulative RTDs $t^{-\gamma}$. For the piecewise-linear maps studied here, $\gamma = 2$. These results reveal a clear quantum signature of classical stickiness in non-KAM systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric control of boundary-catalytic branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on boundary absorbing regions. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.</description>

      <title>The deep Hilbert space of all-to-all interacting SU(3) atoms: from quantum to classical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of chaos in multilevel atoms with all-to-all interactions, inspired by cavity QED. Focusing on a 3-level Tavis-Cummings model in a far detuned limit, we detail its deep Hilbert space structure -- i.e. we enumerate all distinct dynamical sectors, beyond the totally symmetric subspace -- by using the Schur-Weyl duality, which is applicable thanks to the permutation symmetry in the all-to-all Hamiltonian. Strong Hilbert space fragmentation ensues from the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with some sectors displaying regular dynamics and others being chaotic. We uncover that many permutation symmetry sectors contribute to the dynamics in the classical limit, in addition to the commonly studied totally symmetric subspace. To elucidate the dynamical responses in each of the symmetry sectors, we propose a semiclassical description in terms of spin coherent states, which is also able to explain the origin of chaotic or regular dynamics with a simple geometrical argument. Our work contributes to the study of the quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems, and uncovers a rich structure in multilevel all-to-all interacting models.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Population Model with Square-Root Growth Noise and Cell-Size Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a size-structured branching process in which individual cells grow exponentially according to a Feller square-root process and divide under general size-control mechanisms. We obtain exact expressions for the asymptotic population growth rate, the steady-state snapshot distribution of cell sizes, and the fluctuations of the total cell number. Our first result is that the population growth rate is exactly equal to the mean single-cell growth rate, for all noise strengths and for all division and size-regulation schemes that maintain size homeostasis. Thus square-root growth noise is neutral with respect to long-term fitness, in sharp contrast to models with size-independent stochastic growth rates. Second, we show that the steady-state population cell-size distribution is obtained from the deterministic inverse-square-law solution by a one-sided exponential convolution with kernel width set by the strength of growth fluctuations. Third, the mean-rescaled population size $N_t/\left\langle N_t\right\rangle$ converges to a stationary compound Poisson-exponential distribution that depends only on growth noise. This distribution, and hence the long-time shape of population-size fluctuations, is unchanged by division-size noise or asymmetric partitioning. These results identify Feller-type exponential growth with square-root noise as an exactly solvable benchmark for stochastic growth in size-controlled populations and provide concrete signatures that distinguish it from models with size-independent growth-rate noise.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Growth in Stably Stratified Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate uncertainty growth and chaotic dynamics in statistically steady, stably stratified three-dimensional turbulence. Using direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations, we quantify the divergence of initially infinitesimal perturbations via twin simulations and decorrelator diagnostics. At short times, perturbations exhibit exponential growth, allowing us to define a (largest) Lyapunov exponent. We systematically examine how this exponent depends on stratification strength, quantified by the Brunt--V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} frequency and the Froude number, in a parameter regime relevant to oceanic flows. We find that increasing stratification leads to a monotonic reduction of the Lyapunov exponent, indicating suppressed chaoticity. Despite this reduction, uncertainty growth retains the universal temporal sequence observed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence -- initial decay, exponential growth, and saturation. The growth phase is characterized by self-similar decorrelator spectra, but exhibits strong anisotropy: uncertainty spreads much more slowly along the stratification direction than horizontally, with the disparity increasing with stratification strength. An analysis of the decorrelator evolution equation reveals that the suppression of chaos arises primarily from strain-mediated alignment dynamics rather than direct buoyancy coupling. Our results provide a quantitative characterization of predictability and uncertainty growth in stratified turbulence and highlight the utility of decorrelator-based methods for anisotropic geophysical flows.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Environments Favor Extreme Dormancy Strategies and Penalize Intermediate Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dormancy is a widespread adaptive strategy that enables populations to persist in fluctuating environments, yet how its benefits depend on the temporal structure of environmental variability remains unclear. We examine how dormancy interacts with environmental correlation times using a delayed-logistic model in which dormant individuals reactivate after a fixed lag while birth rates fluctuate under temporally correlated stochasticity. Numerical simulations and analytical calculations show that the combination of demographic memory and colored multiplicative noise generates a strongly non-monotonic dependence of fitness on dormancy duration, with three distinct performance regimes. Very short dormancy maximizes linear growth but amplifies fluctuations and extinction risk. Very long dormancy buffers environmental variability, greatly increasing mean extinction times despite slower growth. Strikingly, we find a broad band of intermediate dormancy durations that is maladaptive, simultaneously reducing both growth and persistence due to a mismatch between delay times and environmental autocorrelation. An evolutionary agent-based model confirms bistability between short- and long-dormancy strategies, which avoid intermediate lag times and evolve toward stable extremes. These results show that dormancy duration is not merely a life-history parameter but an adaptive mechanism tuned to environmental timescales, and that intermediate "dangerous middle" strategies can be inherently disfavored. More broadly, this work identifies a generic mechanism by which demographic delays interacting with correlated environmental variability produce a non-monotonic fitness landscape that selects for extreme timing strategies.</description>

Abstract: Models with Hilbert space fragmentation are characterized by (exponentially) many dynamically disconnected subspaces, not associated with conventional symmetries but captured by nontrivial Krylov subspaces. These subspaces usually exhibit a whole range of thermalization properties, from chaotic to integrable, to quantum many-body scars. However, so far, they have not been properly defined, nor can they be easily found, given a Hamiltonian. In this work, we consider Hamiltonians that have integer representations, a common feature of many (most) celebrated models in condensed matter. We show the equivalence of the integer characteristic polynomial factorization and the existence of Krylov subspaces generated from integer vectors. Considering the pair-hopping model, we illustrate how the factorization property can be used as a method to unveil Hilbert space fragmentation. We discuss the generalization over other rings of integers, for example those based on the cyclotomic field which are relevant when working in a given ($\ne 0, \pi$) momentum sector.</description>

      <title>Probes of Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Ergodicity-Breaking Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading interpretation in our current understanding of quantum thermalization. Recent results uncovered strong connections between quantum correlations in thermalizing systems and the structure of free probability theory, leading to the notion of full ETH. However, most studies have been performed for ergodic systems and it is still unclear whether or how full ETH manifests in ergodicity-breaking models. We fill this gap by studying standard probes of full ETH in ergodicity-breaking quantum circuits, presenting numerical and analytical results for interacting integrable systems. These probes can display distinct behavior and undergo a different scaling than the ones observed in ergodic systems. For the analytical results we consider an interacting integrable dual-unitary model and present the exact eigenstates, allowing us to analytically express common probes for full ETH. We discuss the underlying mechanisms responsible for these differences and show how the presence of solitons dictates the behavior of ETH-related quantities in the dual-unitary model. We show numerical evidence that this behavior is sufficiently generic away from dual-unitarity when restricted to the appropriate symmetry sectors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate pattern formation in a driven mixture of two repulsive particles by introducing a Field-based Lattice Model (FLM), a hybrid model that combines aspects of the driven Widom-Rowlison lattice gas (DWRLG) and its statistical field theory. We find that the FLM effectively captures the bulk behavior of the DWRLG in both low- and high-density phases, suggesting that phase transitions in these models may share a universality class. Under the effect of the drive, the FLM additionally reveals an intermediate regime, not reported in the previous DWRLG studies, characterized by "irregular stripes" with widely fluctuating widths, contrasting with the "regular", well-ordered stripes found at higher densities. In this intermediate phase, the system exhibits long-range order, predominantly perpendicular to the drive direction. To construct a continuum description, we derive two coupled partial differential equations via a gradient expansion of the FLM mean mass-transfer equations, supplemented with additive noise. Designing a numerical solver using the pseudospectral method with dealiasing and stochastic time differencing, we reproduce the low-density microemulsion phase (characterized by a non-zero characteristic wavenumber q*) and perpendicular stripes at high density. We identify the non-zero difference in the characteristic velocities of the fields as a necessary condition for perpendicular stripe formation in the high-density phase. The continuum model also uncovers novel behaviors not previously observed in the FLM, such as stripes aligned parallel to the drive and chaotic patterns. This work highlights how the interplay of external drive, particle interactions, and noise can lead to a rich phenomenology in strongly driven binary mixtures.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and conservation laws in non-equilibrium systems</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. Notably, non-linear damping destroys hyperuniformity in hyperuniform fluids. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Improving the efficiency of finite-time memory erasure with potential barrier shaping</title>

Abstract: Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs. We retrieve the approach towards the Landauer limit in terms of the energetics involved with the erasure mechanism under the symmetric setup.</description>

      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Yielding and memory in a driven mean-field model of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors, which lack a unified theoretical description. Here, we study a mean-field model, recently shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. The driven mean-field model, featuring a disordered Hamiltonian structure, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features an oscillatory yielding transition, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system, along with memory formation.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum exclusion processes</title>

Abstract: The QSSEP, short for quantum symmetric simple exclusion process, is a paradigm model for stochastic quantum dynamics. Averaging over the noise, the quantum dynamics reduce to the well-studied SSEP (symmetric simple exclusion process). These notes provide an introduction to quantum exclusion processes, focusing on the example of QSSEP and its connection to free probability, with an emphasis on mathematical aspects.</description>

      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. Finally, our analytical results are confronted with extensive molecular dynamics simulations, which interestingly show the existence of decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystalline phases in regions of the phase diagram that exhibit a high degree of frustration. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>
