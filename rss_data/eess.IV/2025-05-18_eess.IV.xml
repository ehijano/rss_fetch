      <title>GRNN:Recurrent Neural Network based on Ghost Features for Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern video super-resolution (VSR) systems based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require huge computational costs. The problem of feature redundancy is present in most models in many domains, but is rarely discussed in VSR. We experimentally observe that many features in VSR models are also similar to each other, so we propose to use "Ghost features" to reduce this redundancy. We also analyze the so-called "gradient disappearance" phenomenon generated by the conventional recurrent convolutional network (RNN) model, and combine the Ghost module with RNN to complete the modeling on time series. The current frame is used as input to the model together with the next frame, the output of the previous frame and the hidden state. Extensive experiments on several benchmark models and datasets show that the PSNR and SSIM of our proposed modality are improved to some extent. Some texture details in the video are also better preserved.</description>

      <title>ExploreGS: a vision-based low overhead framework for 3D scene reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a low-overhead, vision-based 3D scene reconstruction framework for drones, named ExploreGS. By using RGB images, ExploreGS replaces traditional lidar-based point cloud acquisition process with a vision model, achieving a high-quality reconstruction at a lower cost. The framework integrates scene exploration and model reconstruction, and leverags a Bag-of-Words(BoW) model to enable real-time processing capabilities, therefore, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) training can be executed on-board. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the ExploreGS framework on resource-constrained devices, while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: A Multi-View 2.5D Organ Slice Selector with Cross-Attentional Reasoning for Anatomically-Aware CT Localization in Medical Organ Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate multi-organ segmentation from abdominal CT volumes is a fundamental challenge in medical image analysis. Existing 3D segmentation approaches are computationally and memory intensive, often processing entire volumes that contain many anatomically irrelevant slices. Meanwhile, 2D methods suffer from class imbalance and lack cross-view contextual awareness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, anatomically-aware slice selector pipeline that reduces input volume prior to segmentation. Our unified framework introduces a vision-language model (VLM) for cross-view organ presence detection using fused tri-slice (2.5D) representations from axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. Our proposed model acts as an "expert" in anatomical localization, reasoning over multi-view representations to selectively retain slices with high structural relevance. This enables spatially consistent filtering across orientations while preserving contextual cues. More importantly, since standard segmentation metrics such as Dice or IoU fail to measure the spatial precision of such slice selection, we introduce a novel metric, Slice Localization Concordance (SLC), which jointly captures anatomical coverage and spatial alignment with organ-centric reference slices. Unlike segmentation-specific metrics, SLC provides a model-agnostic evaluation of localization fidelity. Our model offers substantial improvement gains against several baselines across all organs, demonstrating both accurate and reliable organ-focused slice filtering. These results show that our method enables efficient and spatially consistent organ filtering, thereby significantly reducing downstream segmentation cost while maintaining high anatomical fidelity.</description>

      <title>ROIsGAN: A Region Guided Generative Adversarial Framework for Murine Hippocampal Subregion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hippocampus, a critical brain structure involved in memory processing and various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, comprises three key subregions: the dentate gyrus (DG), Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3). Accurate segmentation of these subregions from histological tissue images is essential for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, developmental dynamics, and therapeutic interventions. However, no existing methods address the automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions from tissue images, particularly from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel set of four comprehensive murine hippocampal IHC datasets featuring distinct staining modalities: cFos, NeuN, and multiplexed stains combining cFos, NeuN, and either {\Delta}FosB or GAD67, capturing structural, neuronal activity, and plasticity associated information. Additionally, we propose ROIsGAN, a region-guided U-Net-based generative adversarial network tailored for hippocampal subregion segmentation. By leveraging adversarial learning, ROIsGAN enhances boundary delineation and structural detail refinement through a novel region-guided discriminator loss combining Dice and binary cross-entropy loss. Evaluated across DG, CA1, and CA3 subregions, ROIsGAN consistently outperforms conventional segmentation models, achieving performance gains ranging from 1-10% in Dice score and up to 11% in Intersection over Union (IoU), particularly under challenging staining conditions. Our work establishes foundational datasets and methods for automated hippocampal segmentation, enabling scalable, high-precision analysis of tissue images in neuroscience research. Our generated datasets, proposed model as a standalone tool, and its corresponding source code are publicly available at: https://github.com/MehediAzim/ROIsGAN</description>

      <title>Predicting Risk of Pulmonary Fibrosis Formation in PASC Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, its long-term effects persist through Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding both its duration and optimal management strategies. PASC manifests as a diverse array of persistent or newly emerging symptoms--ranging from fatigue, dyspnea, and neurologic impairments (e.g., brain fog), to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal abnormalities--that extend beyond the acute infection phase. This heterogeneous presentation poses substantial challenges for clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning. In this paper, we focus on imaging findings that may suggest fibrotic damage in the lungs, a critical manifestation characterized by scarring of lung tissue, which can potentially affect long-term respiratory function in patients with PASC. This study introduces a novel multi-center chest CT analysis framework that combines deep learning and radiomics for fibrosis prediction. Our approach leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and interpretable feature extraction, achieving 82.2% accuracy and 85.5% AUC in classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Grad-CAM visualization and radiomics-based feature analysis in providing clinically relevant insights for PASC-related lung fibrosis prediction. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning-driven computational methods for early detection and risk assessment of PASC-related lung fibrosis--presented for the first time in the literature.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Spatial Transcriptomics Interpolation via Cross-modal Cross-slice Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a promising technique that characterizes the spatial gene profiling patterns within the tissue context. Comprehensive ST analysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the missing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical feasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the first attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate positions between adjacent ST slices. Despite intuitive, effective ST interpolation presents significant challenges, including 1) limited continuity across heterogeneous tissue sections, 2) complex intrinsic correlation across genes, and 3) intricate cellular structures and biological semantics within each tissue section. To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a distance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture cross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices, 2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale biological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that integrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained images to filter and align the essential cellular features across ST and H\&amp;E images. Extensive experiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST interpolation. Codes are available at https://github.com/XiaofeiWang2018/C2-STi.</description>

      <title>Pretrained hybrid transformer for generalizable cardiac substructures segmentation from contrast and non-contrast CTs in lung and breast cancers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI automated segmentations for radiation treatment planning (RTP) can deteriorate when applied in clinical cases with different characteristics than training dataset. Hence, we refined a pretrained transformer into a hybrid transformer convolutional network (HTN) to segment cardiac substructures lung and breast cancer patients acquired with varying imaging contrasts and patient scan positions. Cohort I, consisting of 56 contrast-enhanced (CECT) and 124 non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans from patients with non-small cell lung cancers acquired in supine position, was used to create oracle with all 180 training cases and balanced (CECT: 32, NCCT: 32 training) HTN models. Models were evaluated on a held-out validation set of 60 cohort I patients and 66 patients with breast cancer from cohort II acquired in supine (n=45) and prone (n=21) positions. Accuracy was measured using DSC, HD95, and dose metrics. Publicly available TotalSegmentator served as the benchmark. The oracle and balanced models were similarly accurate (DSC Cohort I: 0.80 \pm 0.10 versus 0.81 \pm 0.10; Cohort II: 0.77 \pm 0.13 versus 0.80 \pm 0.12), outperforming TotalSegmentator. The balanced model, using half the training cases as oracle, produced similar dose metrics as manual delineations for all cardiac substructures. This model was robust to CT contrast in 6 out of 8 substructures and patient scan position variations in 5 out of 8 substructures and showed low correlations of accuracy to patient size and age. A HTN demonstrated robustly accurate (geometric and dose metrics) cardiac substructures segmentation from CTs with varying imaging and patient characteristics, one key requirement for clinical use. Moreover, the model combining pretraining with balanced distribution of NCCT and CECT scans was able to provide reliably accurate segmentations under varied conditions with far fewer labeled datasets compared to an oracle model.</description>

      <title>Generative Models in Computational Pathology: A Comprehensive Survey on Methods, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction in computational pathology, offering capabilities such as data-efficient learning, synthetic data augmentation, and multimodal representation across diverse diagnostic tasks. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, multimodal image-text generation, and other generative applications, including spatial simulation and molecular inference. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of generative architectures from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and foundation models with generative capabilities. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing unified, multimodal, and clinically deployable generative systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing and applying generative models in computational pathology.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model in Hyperspectral Image Processing and Analysis: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion Model, as an emerging generative model, has shown unique advantages in hyperspectral image processing. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model can effectively process high-dimensional data, generate high-quality samples, and perform well in denoising and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.</description>

      <title>Diff-Unfolding: A Model-Based Score Learning Framework for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are extensively used for modeling image priors for inverse problems. We introduce \emph{Diff-Unfolding}, a principled framework for learning posterior score functions of \emph{conditional diffusion models} by explicitly incorporating the physical measurement operator into a modular network architecture. Diff-Unfolding formulates posterior score learning as the training of an unrolled optimization scheme, where the measurement model is decoupled from the learned image prior. This design allows our method to generalize across inverse problems at inference time by simply replacing the forward operator without retraining. We theoretically justify our unrolling approach by showing that the posterior score can be derived from a composite model-based optimization formulation. Extensive experiments on image restoration and accelerated MRI show that Diff-Unfolding achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving PSNR by up to 2 dB and reducing LPIPS by $22.7\%$, while being both compact (47M parameters) and efficient (0.72 seconds per $256 \times 256$ image). An optimized C++/LibTorch implementation further reduces inference time to 0.63 seconds, underscoring the practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>From Fibers to Cells: Fourier-Based Registration Enables Virtual Cresyl Violet Staining From 3D Polarized Light Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive assessment of the various aspects of the brain's microstructure requires the use of complementary imaging techniques. This includes measuring the spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers (myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light microscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D orientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been introduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer range while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI acquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after measurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and cytoarchitecture can potentially be established within the same section. However, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a nonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed relationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the complexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows for a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep learning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining of 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. In a supervised setting, we build on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet staining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high correspondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training data using Fourier-based registration methods. In this way, registration can be efficiently calculated during training for local image patches of target and predicted staining. We demonstrate that the proposed method enables prediction of a Cresyl violet staining from 3D-PLI, matching individual cell instances.</description>

      <title>GOUHFI: a novel contrast- and resolution-agnostic segmentation tool for Ultra-High Field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ultra-High Field MRI (UHF-MRI) has become more available and one of the best tools to study the brain. One common step in quantitative neuroimaging is the brain segmentation. However, the differences between UHF-MRI and 1.5-3T images are such that the automatic segmentation techniques optimized at these field strengths usually produce unsatisfactory segmentation results for UHF images. It has been particularly challenging to perform quantitative analyses as typically done with 1.5-3T data, considerably limiting the potential of UHF-MRI. Hence, we propose a novel Deep Learning (DL)-based segmentation technique called GOUHFI: Generalized and Optimized segmentation tool for Ultra-High Field Images, designed to segment UHF images of various contrasts and resolutions. For training, we used a total of 206 label maps from four datasets acquired at 3T, 7T and 9.4T. In contrast to most DL strategies, we used a previously proposed domain randomization approach, where synthetic images generated from the label maps were used for training a 3D U-Net. GOUHFI was tested on seven different datasets and compared to techniques like FastSurferVINN and CEREBRUM-7T. GOUHFI was able to the segment six contrasts and seven resolutions tested at 3T, 7T and 9.4T. Average Dice-Sorensen Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 0.87, 0.84, 0.91 were computed against the ground truth segmentations at 3T, 7T and 9.4T. Moreover, GOUHFI demonstrated impressive resistance to the typical inhomogeneities observed at UHF-MRI, making it a new powerful segmentation tool that allows to apply the usual quantitative analysis pipelines also at UHF. Ultimately, GOUHFI is a promising new segmentation tool, being the first of its kind proposing a contrast- and resolution-agnostic alternative for UHF-MRI, making it the forthcoming alternative for neuroscientists working with UHF-MRI or even lower field strengths.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks based Video Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.</description>

      <title>SRMamba: Mamba for Super-Resolution of LiDAR Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, range-view-based LiDAR point cloud super-resolution techniques attract significant attention as a low-cost method for generating higher-resolution point cloud data. However, due to the sparsity and irregular structure of LiDAR point clouds, the point cloud super-resolution problem remains a challenging topic, especially for point cloud upsampling under novel views. In this paper, we propose SRMamba, a novel method for super-resolution of LiDAR point clouds in sparse scenes, addressing the key challenge of recovering the 3D spatial structure of point clouds from novel views. Specifically, we implement projection technique based on Hough Voting and Hole Compensation strategy to eliminate horizontally linear holes in range image. To improve the establishment of long-distance dependencies and to focus on potential geometric features in vertical 3D space, we employ Visual State Space model and Multi-Directional Scanning mechanism to mitigate the loss of 3D spatial structural information due to the range image. Additionally, an asymmetric U-Net network adapts to the input characteristics of LiDARs with different beam counts, enabling super-resolution reconstruction for multi-beam point clouds. We conduct a series of experiments on multiple challenging public LiDAR datasets (SemanticKITTI and nuScenes), and SRMamba demonstrates significant superiority over other algorithms in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>From Embeddings to Accuracy: Comparing Foundation Models for Radiographic Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, pretrained on extensive datasets, have significantly advanced machine learning by providing robust and transferable embeddings applicable to various domains, including medical imaging diagnostics. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from both general-purpose and medical domain-specific foundation models for training lightweight adapter models in multi-class radiography classification, focusing specifically on tube placement assessment. A dataset comprising 8842 radiographs classified into seven distinct categories was employed to extract embeddings using six foundation models: DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, Med-Flamingo, MedImageInsight, Rad-DINO, and CXR-Foundation. Adapter models were subsequently trained using classical machine learning algorithms. Among these combinations, MedImageInsight embeddings paired with an support vector machine adapter yielded the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) at 93.8%, followed closely by Rad-DINO (91.1%) and CXR-Foundation (89.0%). In comparison, BiomedCLIP and DenseNet121 exhibited moderate performance with mAUC scores of 83.0% and 81.8%, respectively, whereas Med-Flamingo delivered the lowest performance at 75.1%. Notably, most adapter models demonstrated computational efficiency, achieving training within one minute and inference within seconds on CPU, underscoring their practicality for clinical applications. Furthermore, fairness analyses on adapters trained on MedImageInsight-derived embeddings indicated minimal disparities, with gender differences in performance within 2% and standard deviations across age groups not exceeding 3%. These findings confirm that foundation model embeddings-especially those from MedImageInsight-facilitate accurate, computationally efficient, and equitable diagnostic classification using lightweight adapters for radiographic image analysis.</description>

      <title>TACO: Rethinking Semantic Communications with Task Adaptation and Context Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have introduced groundbreaking approaches to innovating next-generation semantic communication, which prioritizes conveying the meaning of a message rather than merely transmitting raw data. A fundamental challenge in semantic communication lies in accurately identifying and extracting the most critical semantic information while adapting to downstream tasks without degrading performance, particularly when the objective at the receiver may evolve over time. To enable flexible adaptation to multiple tasks at the receiver, this work introduces a novel semantic communication framework, which is capable of jointly capturing task-specific information to enhance downstream task performance and contextual information. Through rigorous experiments on popular image datasets and computer vision tasks, our framework shows promising improvement compared to existing work, including superior performance in downstream tasks, better generalizability, ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, and low reconstruction latency.</description>

      <title>HSRMamba: Efficient Wavelet Stripe State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) aims to restore high-resolution images from low-resolution hyperspectral images. Recently, the Visual Mamba model has achieved an impressive balance between performance and computational efficiency. However, due to its 1D scanning paradigm, the model may suffer from potential artifacts during image generation. To address this issue, we propose HSRMamba. While maintaining the computational efficiency of Visual Mamba, we introduce a strip-based scanning scheme to effectively reduce artifacts from global unidirectional scanning. Additionally, HSRMamba uses wavelet decomposition to alleviate modal conflicts between high-frequency spatial features and low-frequency spectral features, further improving super-resolution performance. Extensive experiments show that HSRMamba not only excels in reducing computational load and model size but also outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental imaging flow cytometer using a 1 {\mu}s temporal resolution event-based CMOS camera, with data processed by adaptive feedforward and recurrent spiking neural networks. Our study classifies PMMA particles (12, 16, 20 {\mu}m) flowing at 0.7 m/s in a microfluidic channel. Processing of experimental data highlighted that spiking recurrent networks, including LSTM and GRU models, achieved 98.4% accuracy by leveraging temporal dependencies. Additionally, adaptation mechanisms in lightweight feedforward spiking networks improved accuracy by 4.3%. This work outlines a technological roadmap for neuromorphic-assisted biomedical applications, enhancing classification performance while maintaining low latency and sparsity.</description>

      <title>Contactless pulse rate assessment: Results and insights for application in driving simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera-based monitoring of Pulse Rate (PR) enables continuous and unobtrusive assessment of driver's state, allowing estimation of fatigue or stress that could impact traffic safety. Commonly used wearable Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, while effective, suffer from motion artifacts and user discomfort. This study explores the feasibility of non-contact PR assessment using facial video recordings captured by a Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera in a driving simulation environment. The proposed approach detects subtle skin color variations due to blood flow and compares extracted PR values against reference measurements from a wearable wristband Empatica E4. We evaluate the impact of Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on signal quality and assess statistical differences in PR between age groups. Data obtained from 80 recordings from 64 healthy subjects covering a PR range of 45-160 bpm are analyzed, and signal extraction accuracy is quantified using metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show that EVM slightly improves PR estimation accuracy, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm and RMSE from 7.84 bpm to 6.38 bpm. A statistically significant difference is found between older and younger groups with both video-based and ground truth evaluation procedures. Additionally, we discuss Empatica E4 bias and its potential impact on the overall assessment of contact measurements. Altogether the findings demonstrate the feasibility of camera-based PR monitoring in dynamic environments and its potential integration into driving simulators for real-time physiological assessment.</description>

      <title>Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>WeGA: Weakly-Supervised Global-Local Affinity Learning Framework for Lymph Node Metastasis Prediction in Rectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment in rectal cancer is essential for treatment planning, yet current MRI-based evaluation shows unsatisfactory accuracy, leading to suboptimal clinical decisions. Developing automated systems also faces significant obstacles, primarily the lack of node-level annotations. Previous methods treat lymph nodes as isolated entities rather than as an interconnected system, overlooking valuable spatial and contextual information. To solve this problem, we present WeGA, a novel weakly-supervised global-local affinity learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) a dual-branch architecture with DINOv2 backbone for global context and residual encoder for local node details; 2) a global-local affinity extractor that aligns features across scales through cross-attention fusion; and 3) a regional affinity loss that enforces structural coherence between classification maps and anatomical regions. Experiments across one internal and two external test centers demonstrate that WeGA outperforms existing methods, achieving AUCs of 0.750, 0.822, and 0.802 respectively. By effectively modeling the relationships between individual lymph nodes and their collective context, WeGA provides a more accurate and generalizable approach for lymph node metastasis prediction, potentially enhancing diagnostic precision and treatment selection for rectal cancer patients.</description>

      <title>reBEN: Refined BigEarthNet Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03653v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents refined BigEarthNet (reBEN) that is a large-scale, multi-modal remote sensing dataset constructed to support deep learning (DL) studies for remote sensing image analysis. The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. The pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset are available at https://bigearth.net.</description>
