      <title>Zero Energy Bound States on Nano Atomic Line Defect in Iron-based High Temperature Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on Fe atomic line defect in iron-based high temperature superconductors, we explore the origin of the zero energy bound states near the endpoints of the line defect by employing the two-orbit four-band tight binding model. With increasing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling along the line defect, the zero energy resonance peaks move simultaneously forward to negative energy for $s_{+-}$ pairing symmetry, but split for $s_{++}$ pairing symmetry. The superconducting order parameter correction due to As(Te, Se) atoms missing does not shift the zero energy resonance peaks. Such the zero energy bound states are induced by the weak magnetic order rather than the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling on Fe atomic line defect.</description>

      <title>Three-gap superconductivity with $T_{c}$ above 80 K in hydrogenated 2D monolayer LiBC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the metalization of semiconductor bulk LiBC has been experimentally achieved, various flaws, including the strong lattice distortion, the uncontrollability of phase transition under pressure, usually appear. In this work, based on the first-principles calculations, we propose a new way of hydrogenation to realize metalization. Using the fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we investigate the superconducting behaviors in the stable monolayers LiBCH and LiCBH, in which C and B atoms are hydrogenated, respectively. Our findings indicate that the monolayers possess the high $T_{c}$ of 82.0 and 82.5 K, respectively, along with the interesting three-gap superconducting natures. The Fermi sheets showing the obvious three-region distribution characteristics and the abnormally strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) are responsible for the high-$T_{c}$ three-gap superconductivity. Furthermore, the $T_{c}$ can be dramatically boosted up to 120.0 K under 3.5 \% tensile strain. To a great extent, the high $T_{c}$ is beyond the liquid nitrogen temperature ($77$ K), which is beneficial for the applications in future experiments. This study not only explores the superconducting properties of the monolayers LiBCH and LiCBH, but also offers practical insights into the search for high-$T_{c}$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Paramagnetic Peak Effect in Reversible Magnetization of Crystalline Miassite Superconductor $\text{Rh}_{17}\text{S}_{15}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an unusual anisotropic paramagnetic peak effect observed in reversible magnetization of a single crystalline nodal superconductor $\text{Rh}_{17}\text{S}_{15}$. Both temperature- and field-dependent magnetization measurements reveal a distinct novel vortex state above approximately 1 T. This peak effect is most pronounced when the magnetic field, $H$, is applied parallel to the $\left[111\right]$ direction, whereas it diminishes for $H\parallel\left[110\right]$. Intriguingly, for $H\parallel\left[100\right]$, instead of a peak, we observe a step-like decrease in $M(T)$, with the step amplitude increasing in larger applied magnetic fields. This behavior is opposite to the expectations of conventional Meissner expulsion. The magnitude of the peak effect, expressed in terms of dimensionless volume susceptibility, is on the order of $\Delta\chi=10^{-5}$ (with full diamagnetic screening corresponding to $\chi=-1$). The observed anisotropic paramagnetic vortex response is unusual considering the cubic symmetry of $\text{Rh}_{17}\text{S}_{15}$. We propose that in this distinct vortex phase, a small but finite attractive interaction between vortices below $H_{c2}$ may be responsible for this unusual phenomenon. Furthermore, the vortices seem to prefer aligning along the $\left[111\right]$ direction, rotating toward it when the magnetic field is applied in other directions. Our findings add another item to the list of unusual properties of $\text{Rh}_{17}\text{S}_{15}$ that attracted recent attention as the first unconventional superconductor that has a mineral analog, miassite, found in nature.</description>

      <title>Impact of rotational symmetry breaking on $d$-wave superconductivity in Hubbard models for cuprate and nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed the substantial impact of broken rotational symmetry on the superconductivity. In the pursuit of understanding the role played by this symmetry breaking particularly in cuprate and nickelate superconductors on their superconductivity, we investigated two characteristic symmetry breaking mechanisms arising from (1) structurally orthogonal distortions from $C_4$ to $C_2$ symmetry and (2) anisotropic hybridization between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and an additional metallic band within the framework of the Hubbard model by employing dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We discovered that the anisotropy is generically detrimental to the $d$-wave pairing so that the experimental findings of much lower superconducting $T_c$ of infinite-layer nickelates compared with the cuprates may be connected to the intrinsic anisotropy. Our exploration sheds light on the fundamental anisotropy factors governing superconductivity in nickelates and cuprates and offer insights contributing to the broader understanding of unconventional superconductors in anisotropic environment.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of niobium-based superconducting alloys in the light of crystal chemistry: A brief survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we focus on Nb-based binary intermetallic compounds, which have been widely used over the last 40 years to develop a range of superconducting applications, including non-standard engineering solutions in the design of large magnets. However, since the 1980s, when it became apparent that the mechanical and superior superconducting properties of ordered intermetallic alloys such as Nb$_{3}$Sn were largely due to their unique structural features, much of the research interest in the science of superconducting intermetallic alloys has been redirected to the development of necessary engineering applications in high magnetic field technology. Accordingly, the important role of crystal chemistry in understanding the fundamental aspects of the material properties of the Nb$_{3}$Sn family of intermetallics has been little explored. In the paper, we try to fill this gap by investigating the relationships between composition, microstructure and properties, highlighting their relevance to technological applications. Our goal is to link aspects of crystal chemistry with materials application issues. We shed light on the atomic assembly mechanisms and processes in terms of changes in the chemical environment, lattice structure, crystallization pathway, and macroscale phase textures, which can help in interpreting and explaining the prospects and limitations of the superconducting properties of Nb$_{3}$Sn. In the context of past and present prospects and limitations we briefly overview most important technological applications and discuss the various interrelations between superconductivity and structural properties of Nb-based A-15 intermetallic alloys. We argue that these interrelations can be used to find the Nb-based superconductors with more superior properties and stronger technological usability.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of the superconductor-quantum Hall interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important route of engineering topological states and excitations is to combine superconductors (SC) with the quantum Hall (QH) effect, and over the past decade, significant progress has been made in this direction. While typical measurements of these states focus on electronic properties, little attention has been paid to the accompanying thermal responses. Here, we examine the thermal properties of the interface between a type-II superconducting electrodes and graphene in the QH regime. We use the thermal noise measurement to probe the local electron temperature of the biased interface. Surprisingly, the measured temperature raise indicates that the superconductor provides a significant thermal conductivity, which is linear in temperature. This suggests electronic heat transport and may be unexpected, because the number of the quasiparticles in the superconductor should be exponentially suppressed. Instead, we attribute the measured electronic heat conductivity to the overlap of the normal states in the vortex cores.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconductivity in the low-frequency electrodynamic response of two-dimensional granular In/InO$_x$ composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the full complex ac conductance of two-dimensional granular In/InO$_x$ composites using the mutual inductance technique to explore the transition from a "failed-superconductor-turned anomalous metal" to a robust superconductor. In this system, room-temperature annealing was adopted to tune the InO$_x$-mediated coupling between In grains, allowing for the observation of both a "true" superconductor-to-insulator transition and the emergence of an intervening anomalous metallic state. In this paper, we show that further annealing increases the inter-grain coupling, which eliminates the anomalous metallic phase, but at the same time prevent the emergence of strong Bose-dominated insulating phase. The complex ac conductance revealed a $T\to0$ saturating dissipative response in a finite magnetic field, coexisting with a robust superfluid density. The anomalous power-law spectra for the dissipative response appear to indicate quantum critical behavior proximate to a quantum superconductor to anomalous-metal transition as probed in the kilo-Hertz range, and point to signatures of gapless superconductivity in our granular superconducting system.</description>

      <title>Driving a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier into chaos: effects of a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a comprehensive numerical analysis of the dynamic response of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) by varying the driving parameters, with a focus on the pathways leading to chaotic behavior. By tuning the working conditions, we capture the broad spectrum of dynamical regimes accessible to JTWPAs, delineating the settings under which transition to chaos occurs. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to device formed by junctions characterized by a non--sinusoidal current phase relation (CPR) and exploring the impact of its shape on the amplifier's performance. Through the study of gain characteristics, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra, we provide an in-depth understanding of how non-linearity and CPR nonsinusoidality influence the JTWPAs' operational effectiveness and stability. This investigation offers insights into optimizing the device designs for enhanced performance and robustness against chaotic disruptions, in order to establish a framework for predicting and controlling JTWPA behavior in practical applications. This effort will pave the way for the development of devices with tailored dynamic responses and for advancements in quantum computing and precision measurement technologies, where stability and high fidelity are of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Voltage-driven dynamics of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S Josephson junctions chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with anomalous phase shift $\varphi_0$ ($\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs) realize a coupling between the superconducting phase and the spin degrees of freedom. Consequently, the anomalous phase shift is a hallmark effect of superconducting spintronics and opens great perspectives for applications of such structures for controlling magnetization. Besides controlling the magnetization of a single ferromagnet, the direct coupling between the phase and the magnetization provides a possibility to establish and control a collective behavior of magnetic moments of different weak links in coupled chains of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs. Here we investigate voltage-driven dynamics of such chains and predict that the spin-phase coupling makes the conventional voltage-driven regime unstable. As a result the system undergoes a transition to other dynamical regimes, where clear signatures of the spin-phase coupling and the collective behavior are observed.</description>

      <title>Pb Substitution Effects on Lattice and Electronic System of the BiS$_{2}$-based Superconductors La(OF)BiS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the effect of Pb substitution in the layered superconductor $\mathrm{La}$$\mathrm{O}_{0.5}$$\mathrm{F}_{0.5}$$\mathrm{Bi}_{1-x}$$ \mathrm{Pb}_{x}$$\mathrm{S}_{2}$ (${x}=0{\sim}0.15$) through the measurements of the resistivity, thermal expansion, specific heat, and Seebeck coefficient. These transport and thermal properties show anomalies at certain temperatures (T*) for ${x}{\geq}0.08$. The large thermal expansion anomalies, specific heat anomalies, and the existence of hystereses in the above measurements indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T*. Additionally, the Seebeck coefficient indicates that the anomalies at T* are related not only to the lattice system, but also to the electronic system. Superconductivity is not observed above 2 K at ${x}$=0.08, which is around the phase boundary where T* vanishes. The suppression of superconductivity around the structural phase boundary suggests a close relationship between the lattice and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Generation of Superflow in a Fermionic Ring through Phase Imprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamic generation of persistent current by phase imprinting fermionic atoms in a ring geometry. Mediated by the pairing interaction, the Fermi condensate dynamically acquires a quantized current by developing azimuthal phase slips, as well as density and pairing-order-parameter depletions. Resorting to the Bogolioubov-de Gennes formalism, we investigate the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized superfluid current throughout the phase-imprinting process. This enables a detailed analysis of the impact of interaction, as well as different initial pairing states, on the superflow formation. In particular, we show that, as the condensate is tuned toward the Bose-Einstein-condensate side of the Feshbach resonance, the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential, leading to smaller quantized current under the same imprinting parameters. Our results offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow in the phase-imprinting process, and are helpful for the ongoing experimental effort.</description>

      <title>Sub-symmetry Protected Topology in Topological Insulators and Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration of topology protected by a certain symmetry is central in condensed matter physics. A recent idea of sub-symmetry-protected (SSP) topology--remains of a broken symmetry can still protect specific topological boundary states--has been developed and demonstrated in an optical system [Nat. Phys. 19, 992-998 (2023)]. Here, we extend this idea further by applying sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation (SSPP) to one-dimensional topological insulating and superconducting systems using the Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) and Kitaev models. Using the tight-binding and low-energy effective theory, we show that the SSP boundary states retain topological properties while the SSPP results in the asymmetry of boundary states. For the SSH model, an SSP zero-energy edge state localized on one edge possesses quantized polarization. In contrast, the other edge state is perturbed to have non-zero energy, and its polarization is not quantized. For topological superconductors, zero-energy SSP Majorana boundary states for spinful Kitaev models emerge on only one edge, contrary to the conventional belief that Majorana fermions emerge at opposite edges. Our findings can be used as a platform to expand our understanding of topological materials as they broaden our understanding of the symmetry in a topological system and a method to engineer Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum metric due to vacancies in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random vacancies in a graphene monolayer induce defect states that are known to form a narrow impurity band centered around zero energy at half-filling. We use a space-resolved formulation of the quantum metric and establish a strong enhancement of the electronic correlations in this impurity band. The enhancement is primarily due to strong correlations between pairs of vacancies situated on different sublattices at anomalously large spatial distances. We trace the strong enhancement to both the multifractal vacancy wave functions, which ties the system exactly at the Anderson insulator transition for all defect concentrations, and preserving the chiral symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a realistic model for superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_{2}$, where electron pairing arises from spin-valley fluctuations in the weak-coupling regime. Our model comprises both the full continuum model moir\'{e} bandstructure and a short-ranged repulsive interaction. By calculating the spin-valley susceptibility, we identify a Fermi surface nesting feature near half-filling of the top-most moir\'{e} band, which induces significantly enhanced spin-valley fluctuations. We then analyze the dominant Kohn-Luttinger pairing instabilities due to these spin-valley fluctuations and show that the leading instability corresponds to a two-component order parameter, which can give rise to nematic, chiral and topological superconductivity. As our findings are asymptotically exact for small interaction strengths, they provide a viable starting point for future studies of superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Dependent Electron Correlation in Double-Layer Nickelate La3Ni2O7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest discovery of high temperature superconductivity near 80K in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has attracted much attention. Many proposals are put forth to understand the origin of superconductivity.The determination of electronic structures is a prerequisite to establish theories to understand superconductivity in nickelates but is still lacking. Here we report our direct measurement of the electronic structures of La3Ni2O7 by high-resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The Fermi surface and band structures of La3Ni2O7 are observed and compared with the band structure calculations. Strong electron correlations are revealed which are orbital- and momentum dependent. A flat band is formed from the Ni-3dz2 orbitals around the zone corner which is ~50meV below the Fermi level and exhibits the strongest electron correlation. In many theoretical proposals, this band is expected to play the dominant role in generating superconductivity in La3Ni2O7. Our observations provide key experimental information to understand the electronic structure and origin of high temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>"Quantum bipolaron" superconductivity from quadratic electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the electron-phonon coupling is quadratic in the phonon coordinates, electrons can pair to form bipolarons due to phonon zero-point fluctuations, a purely quantum effect. We study superconductivity originating from this pairing mechanism in a minimal model and reveal that, in the strong coupling regime, the critical temperature ($T_c$) is only mildly suppressed by the coupling strength, in stark contrast to the exponential suppression in linearly coupled systems, thus implying higher optimal $T_c$ values. We demonstrate that large coupling constants of this flavor are achieved in known materials such as perovskites, and discuss strategies to realize such superconductivity using superlattices.</description>

      <title>Effects of Strong Capacitive Coupling Between Meta-Atoms in rf SQUID Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider, for the first time, the effects of strong capacitive and inductive coupling between radio frequency Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (rf SQUIDs) in an overlapping metamaterial geometry when driven by rf flux at and near their self-resonant frequencies. The equations of motion for the gauge-invariant phases on the Josephson junctions in each SQUID are set up and solved. Our model accounts for the high-frequency displacement currents through capacitive overlap between the wiring of SQUID loops. We begin by modeling two overlapping SQUIDs and studying the response in both the linear and nonlinear high-frequency driving limits. By exploring a sequence of more and more complicated arrays, the formalism is eventually extended to the $N\times N \times 2$ overlapping metamaterial array, where we develop an understanding of the many ($8N^2-8N+3$) resulting resonant modes in terms of three classes of resonances. The capacitive coupling gives rise to qualitatively new self-resonant responses of rf SQUID metamaterials, and is demonstrated through analytical theory, numerical modeling, and experiment in the 10-30 GHz range on capacitively and inductively coupled rf SQUID metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Creep-enhanced vortex pinning revealed through nonmonotonic relaxation of the Campbell length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of flux creep on the linear AC response of the vortex lattice in single crystals Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ by measuring the Campbell penetration depth, $\lambda_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle C}(T,H,t)$. Thermal fluctuations release vortices from shallow pinning sites, only for them to become re-trapped by deeper potential wells, causing an initial increase of the effective Labusch parameter, which is proportional to the pinning well curvature. This effect cannot be detected in conventional magnetic relaxation measurements but is revealed by our observation of a nonmonotonic time evolution of $\lambda_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle C}(T,H,t)$, which directly probes the average curvature of the occupied pinning centers. The time evolution of $\lambda_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle C}(T,H,t)$ was measured at different temperatures in samples with different densities of pinning centers produced by electron irradiation. The curves can be collapsed together when plotted on a logarithmic time scale $t \to T\ln{(t/t_0)}$ confirming that the time evolution is driven by flux creep. The $\lambda_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle C}(T,H,t)$ is hysteretic with a noticeable nonmonotonic relaxation in the presence of a vortex density gradient (after zero-field cooling), but is monotonic after field cooling, where the vortex density is uniform. This result quantitatively corroborates the novel picture of vortex creep based on the strong pinning theory.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductors: The role of long-range Coulomb interaction and signatures in density response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate collective excitations in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states of Pauli-limited superconducting films. When the long-range Coulomb interaction is absent, excitation spectra consist of two gapless and three gapped modes. The gapless modes are the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of the ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry and the translational symmetry. The gapped modes include the Higgs mode and the twofold degenerate modes that cause the oscillation of the domain width and grayness of FFLO nodal planes. We find that the long-range Coulomb interaction only gaps out the gapless phase mode through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, while the other modes remain unaffected. Furthermore, the field evolution of the dispersion of the gapless elastic mode, the Nambu-Goldstone mode associated with the translational symmetry breaking, is associated with that of the bandwidth of the mid-gap Andreev bound states. We demonstrate that the signature of the elastic mode can be detected by measuring the density-density response function.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Nesting with Heavy Quasiparticles in the Locally Noncentrosymmetric Superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The locally noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has attracted considerable interests due to its rich superconducting phases, accompanied by a quadrupole density wave and pronounced antiferromagnetic excitations. To understand the underlying physics, we here report measurements from high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission. Our results reveal fine splittings of the conduction bands related to the locally noncentrosymmetric structure, as well as a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface (FS) with strong $4f$ contributions. The FS exhibits nesting with an in-plane vector $({\pi}/a, {\pi}/a)$, which is facilitated by the van Hove singularity near $\bar X$ that arises from the characteristic conduction-$f$ hybridization. The FS nesting provides a natural explanation for the observed antiferromagnetic excitations at $({\pi}/a, {\pi}/a)$, which could be intimately connected to its unconventional superconductivity. Our experimental results are well supported by density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory calculations, which can capture the strong correlation effects. Our study not only provides spectroscopic proof of the key factors underlying the field-induced superconducting transition, but also uncovers the critical role of FS nesting and lattice Kondo effect in the intertwined spin and charge fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Design of High Pressure Hydride Superconductors using DFT and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in hydride-based materials under ultrahigh pressures (for example, H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$) has fueled the interest in a more data-driven approach to discovering new high-pressure hydride superconductors. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the critical temperature ($T_c$) of over 900 hydride materials under a pressure range of (0 to 500) GPa, where we found 122 dynamically stable structures with a $T_c$ above MgB$_2$ (39 K). To accelerate screening, we trained a graph neural network (GNN) model to predict $T_c$ and demonstrated that a universal machine learned force-field can be used to relax hydride structures under arbitrary pressures, with significantly reduced cost. By combining DFT and GNNs, we can establish a more complete map of hydrides under pressure.</description>
