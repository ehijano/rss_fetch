      <title>Graph Residual based Method for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Property prediction of materials has recently been of high interest in the recent years in the field of material science. Various Physics-based and Machine Learning models have already been developed, that can give good results. However, they are not accurate enough and are inadequate for critical applications. The traditional machine learning models try to predict properties based on the features extracted from the molecules, which are not easily available most of the time. In this paper, a recently developed novel Deep Learning method, the Graph Neural Network (GNN), has been applied, allowing us to predict properties directly only the Graph-based structures of the molecules. SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation of the molecules has been used in the present study as input data format, which has been further converted into a graph database, which constitutes the training data. This article highlights the detailed description of the novel GRU-based methodology to map the inputs that have been used. Emphasis on highlighting both the regressive property as well as the classification-based property of the GNN backbone. A detailed description of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and the end-to-end learning method has been given to highlight the multi-class multi-label property prediction of the backbone. The results have been compared with standard benchmark datasets as well as some newly developed datasets. All performance metrics which have been used have been clearly defined as well as their reason for choice. Keywords: GNN, VAE, SMILES, multi-label multi-class classification, GRU</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of bone growth and mineralization surrounding biodegradable Mg-based and permanent Ti implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In silico testing of implant materials is a research area of high interest, as cost- and labour-intensive experiments may be omitted. However, assessing the tissue-material interaction mathematically and computationally can be very complex, in particular when functional, such as biodegradable, implant materials are investigated. In this work, we expand and refine suitable existing mathematical models of bone growth and magnesium-based implant degradation based on ordinary differential equations. We show that we can simulate the implant degradation, as well as the osseointegration in terms of relative bone volume fraction and changes in bone ultrastructure when applying the model to experimental data from titanium and magnesium-gadolinium implants for healing times up to 32 weeks. By conducting a parameter study we further show that a lack of data at early time points has little influence on the simulation outcome. Moreover, we show that the model is predictive in terms of relative bone volume fraction with mean absolute errors below 6%</description>

      <title>Question Rephrasing for Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models: Applications in Molecular Chemistry Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification enables users to assess the reliability of responses generated by large language models (LLMs). We present a novel Question Rephrasing technique to evaluate the input uncertainty of LLMs, which refers to the uncertainty arising from equivalent variations of the inputs provided to LLMs. This technique is integrated with sampling methods that measure the output uncertainty of LLMs, thereby offering a more comprehensive uncertainty assessment. We validated our approach on property prediction and reaction prediction for molecular chemistry tasks.</description>

      <title>Mitosis, Cytoskeleton Regulation, and Drug Resistance in Receptor Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>

Abstract: During cell division, the receptor triple-negative MDA-MB-231 mitotic spindles are the largest in comparison to other BC cell lines. Many of the MDA-MB-231 spindles exhibit rapid lateral twisting during metaphase, which remains unaffected by knockdown of the oncogene Myc and treatment with inhibitors of the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alone or in any combination. The MDA-MB-231 cells are the most aggressive and rapidly form metastatic tumors in xenograft transplant models, and exhibited very high proliferation rates when plated as three-dimensional cultures in Matrigel. Quantitative image analysis of microtubules (MTs) in six BC cell lines - MDA-MB-231 (receptor negative), HCC-1143 (receptor negative), HCC-3153 (receptor negative), ZR75B (estrogen receptor-positive), LY2 (progesterone receptor-positive), HCC-1428 (estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive) - demonstrated that the rotational spindle rocking of MDA-MB-231 cells during metaphase appears coupled with a significant increase in MT polymerization rates during interphase, which likely shortens interphase and accelerates cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. Unlike the uniform treadmilling rates of about 21 um/min in kinetochore MTs during metaphase we measured across cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells in interphase exhibit the fastest MT polymerization dynamics of about 19 um/min and this is coupled with abnormal mitotic spindle oscillations of almost 30 um/min. This aberrant behavior in MDA-MB-231 spindles may represent a therapeutically targetable disrupted mechanism of spindle positioning in receptor triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells leading to tumor aggressiveness. In this manuscript, we outline a strategy for the selection of the most optimal tubulin inhibitor based on the ability to affect MT dynamics.</description>
