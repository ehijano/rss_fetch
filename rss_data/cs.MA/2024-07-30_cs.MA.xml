      <title>Collaborative Adaptation for Recovery from Unforeseen Malfunctions in Discrete and Continuous MARL Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent learning plays a crucial role for developing effective strategies to achieve individual or shared objectives in multi-agent teams. In real-world settings, agents may face unexpected failures, such as a robot's leg malfunctioning or a teammate's battery running out. These malfunctions decrease the team's ability to accomplish assigned task(s), especially if they occur after the learning algorithms have already converged onto a collaborative strategy. Current leading approaches in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often recover slowly -- if at all -- from such malfunctions. To overcome this limitation, we present the Collaborative Adaptation (CA) framework, highlighting its unique capability to operate in both continuous and discrete domains. Our framework enhances the adaptability of agents to unexpected failures by integrating inter-agent relationships into their learning processes, thereby accelerating the recovery from malfunctions. We evaluated our framework's performance through experiments in both discrete and continuous environments. Empirical results reveal that in scenarios involving unforeseen malfunction, although state-of-the-art algorithms often converge on sub-optimal solutions, the proposed CA framework mitigates and recovers more effectively.</description>

      <title>Navigation services amplify concentration of traffic and emissions in our cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of human-AI ecosystems involving human interaction with algorithms, such as assistants and recommenders, raises concerns about large-scale social behaviour. Despite evidence of such phenomena across several contexts, the collective impact of GPS navigation services remains unclear: while beneficial to the user, they can also cause chaos if too many vehicles are driven through the same few roads. Our study employs a simulation framework to assess navigation services' influence on road network usage and CO2 emissions. The results demonstrate a universal pattern of amplified conformity: increasing adoption rates of navigation services cause a reduction of route diversity of mobile travellers and increased concentration of traffic and emissions on fewer roads, thus exacerbating an unequal distribution of negative externalities on selected neighbourhoods. Although navigation services recommendations can help reduce CO2 emissions when their adoption rate is low, these benefits diminish or even disappear when the adoption rate is high and exceeds a certain city- and service-dependent threshold. We summarize these discoveries in a non-linear function that connects the marginal increase of conformity with the marginal reduction in CO2 emissions. Our simulation approach addresses the challenges posed by the complexity of transportation systems and the lack of data and algorithmic transparency.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Majority Illusion is Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majority Illusion is a phenomenon in social networks wherein the decision by the majority of the network is not the same as one's personal social circle's majority, leading to an incorrect perception of the majority in a large network. In this paper, we present polynomial-time algorithms which can eliminate majority illusion in a network by altering as few connections as possible. Additionally, we prove that the more general problem of ensuring all neighbourhoods in the network are at least a $p$-fraction of the majority is NP-hard for most values of $p$.</description>

      <title>When AI Meets Finance (StockAgent): Large Language Model-based Stock Trading in Simulated Real-world Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can AI Agents simulate real-world trading environments to investigate the impact of external factors on stock trading activities (e.g., macroeconomics, policy changes, company fundamentals, and global events)? These factors, which frequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for maximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through large language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system called StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading behaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to evaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to analyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent avoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation systems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging prior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate different LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment that closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading, including trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research explores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior knowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent simulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock recommendation. The code is available at https://github.com/MingyuJ666/Stockagent.</description>

      <title>Relational Q-Functionals: Multi-Agent Learning to Recover from Unforeseen Robot Malfunctions in Continuous Action Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent learning methods are essential in developing effective cooperation strategies in multi-agent domains. In robotics, these methods extend beyond multi-robot scenarios to single-robot systems, where they enable coordination among different robot modules (e.g., robot legs or joints). However, current methods often struggle to quickly adapt to unforeseen failures, such as a malfunctioning robot leg, especially after the algorithm has converged to a strategy. To overcome this, we introduce the Relational Q-Functionals (RQF) framework. RQF leverages a relational network, representing agents' relationships, to enhance adaptability, providing resilience against malfunction(s). Our algorithm also efficiently handles continuous state-action domains, making it adept for robotic learning tasks. Our empirical results show that RQF enables agents to use these relationships effectively to facilitate cooperation and recover from an unexpected malfunction in single-robot systems with multiple interacting modules. Thus, our approach offers promising applications in multi-agent systems, particularly in scenarios with unforeseen malfunctions.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm-based Routing and Scheduling for Wildfire Suppression using a Team of UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses early wildfire management using a team of UAVs for the mitigation of fires. The early detection and mitigation systems help in alleviating the destruction with reduced resource utilization. A Genetic Algorithm-based Routing and Scheduling with Time constraints (GARST) is proposed to find the shortest schedule route to mitigate the fires as Single UAV Tasks (SUT). The objective of GARST is to compute the route and schedule of the UAVs so that the UAVS reach the assigned fire locations before the fire becomes a Multi UAV Task (MUT) and completely quench the fire using the extinguisher. The fitness function used for the genetic algorithm is the total quench time for mitigation of total fires. The selection, crossover, mutation operators, and elitist strategies collectively ensure the exploration and exploitation of the solution space, maintaining genetic diversity, preventing premature convergence, and preserving high-performing individuals for the effective optimization of solutions. The GARST effectively addresses the challenges posed by the NP-complete problem of routing and scheduling for growing tasks with time constraints. The GARST is able to handle infeasible scenarios effectively, contributing to the overall optimization of the wildfire management system.</description>

      <title>A Resource-Efficient Decentralized Sequential Planner for Spatiotemporal Wildfire Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Conflict-aware Resource-Efficient Decentralized Sequential planner (CREDS) for early wildfire mitigation using multiple heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Multi-UAV wildfire management scenarios are non-stationary, with spatially clustered dynamically spreading fires, potential pop-up fires, and partial observability due to limited UAV numbers and sensing range. The objective of CREDS is to detect and sequentially mitigate all growing fires as Single-UAV Tasks (SUT), minimizing biodiversity loss through rapid UAV intervention and promoting efficient resource utilization by avoiding complex multi-UAV coordination. CREDS employs a three-phased approach, beginning with fire detection using a search algorithm, followed by local trajectory generation using the auction-based Resource-Efficient Decentralized Sequential planner (REDS), incorporating the novel non-stationary cost function, the Deadline-Prioritized Mitigation Cost (DPMC). Finally, a conflict-aware consensus algorithm resolves conflicts to determine a global trajectory for spatiotemporal mitigation. The performance evaluation of the CREDS for partial and full observability conditions with both heterogeneous and homogeneous UAV teams for different fires-to-UAV ratios demonstrates a $100\%$ success rate for ratios up to $4$ and a high success rate for the critical ratio of $5$, outperforming baselines. Heterogeneous UAV teams outperform homogeneous teams in handling heterogeneous deadlines of SUT mitigation. CREDS exhibits scalability and $100\%$ convergence, demonstrating robustness against potential deadlock assignments, enhancing its success rate compared to the baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cooperative path-finding: A Scalable Multi-Agent RRT* with Dynamic Potential Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.07840v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative path-finding in multi-agent systems demands scalable solutions to navigate agents from their origins to destinations without conflict. Despite the breadth of research, scalability remains hampered by increased computational demands in complex environments. This study introduces the multi-agent RRT* potential field (MA-RRT*PF), an innovative algorithm that addresses computational efficiency and path-finding efficacy in dense scenarios. MA-RRT*PF integrates a dynamic potential field with a heuristic method, advancing obstacle avoidance and optimizing the expansion of random trees in congested spaces. The empirical evaluations highlight MA-RRT*PF's significant superiority over conventional multi-agent RRT* (MA-RRT*) in dense environments, offering enhanced performance and solution quality without compromising integrity. This work not only contributes a novel approach to the field of cooperative multi-agent path-finding but also offers a new perspective for practical applications in densely populated settings where traditional methods are less effective.</description>

      <title>B2MAPO: A Batch-by-Batch Multi-Agent Policy Optimization to Balance Performance and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches adopt two types of policy optimization methods that either update policy simultaneously or sequentially. Simultaneously updating policies of all agents introduces non-stationarity problem. Although sequentially updating policies agent-by-agent in an appropriate order improves policy performance, it is prone to low efficiency due to sequential execution, resulting in longer model training and execution time. Intuitively, partitioning policies of all agents according to their interdependence and updating joint policy batch-by-batch can effectively balance performance and efficiency. However, how to determine the optimal batch partition of policies and batch updating order are challenging problems. Firstly, a sequential batched policy updating scheme, B2MAPO (Batch by Batch Multi-Agent Policy Optimization), is proposed with a theoretical guarantee of the monotonic incrementally tightened bound. Secondly, a universal modulized plug-and-play B2MAPO hierarchical framework, which satisfies CTDE principle, is designed to conveniently integrate any MARL models to fully exploit and merge their merits, including policy optimality and inference efficiency. Next, a DAG-based B2MAPO algorithm is devised, which is a carefully designed implementation of B2MAPO framework. Comprehensive experimental results conducted on StarCraftII Multi-agent Challenge and Google Football Research demonstrate the performance of DAG-based B2MAPO algorithm outperforms baseline methods. Meanwhile, compared with A2PO, our algorithm reduces the model training and execution time by 60.4% and 78.7%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Opponent Modeling in Multiplayer Imperfect-Information Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world settings agents engage in strategic interactions with multiple opposing agents who can employ a wide variety of strategies. The standard approach for designing agents for such settings is to compute or approximate a relevant game-theoretic solution concept such as Nash equilibrium and then follow the prescribed strategy. However, such a strategy ignores any observations of opponents' play, which may indicate shortcomings that can be exploited. We present an approach for opponent modeling in multiplayer imperfect-information games where we collect observations of opponents' play through repeated interactions. We run experiments against a wide variety of real opponents and exact Nash equilibrium strategies in three-player Kuhn poker and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms all of the agents, including the exact Nash equilibrium strategies.</description>

      <title>Recomputing Solutions to Perturbed Multi-Commodity Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problems using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Commodity Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem aims to optimize the pickup and delivery of multiple unique commodities using a fleet of several agents with limited payload capacities. This paper addresses the challenge of quickly recomputing the solution to this NP-hard problem when there are unexpected perturbations to the nominal task definitions, likely to occur under real-world operating conditions. The proposed method first decomposes the nominal problem by constructing a search tree using Monte Carlo Tree Search for task assignment, and uses a rapid heuristic for routing each agent. When changes to the problem are revealed, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated with new costs under the updated problem parameters, generating solutions quicker and with a reduced optimality gap, as compared to recomputing the solution as an entirely new problem. Computational experiments are conducted by varying the locations of the nominal problem and the payload capacity of an agent to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing the nominal search tree to handle perturbations for real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Unconstraining Multi-Robot Manipulation: Enabling Arbitrary Constraints in ECBS with Bounded Sub-Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Robot-Arm Motion Planning (M-RAMP) is a challenging problem featuring complex single-agent planning and multi-agent coordination. Recent advancements in extending the popular Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm have made large strides in solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problems. However, fundamental challenges remain in applying CBS to M-RAMP. A core challenge is the existing reliance of the CBS framework on conservative "complete" constraints. These constraints ensure solution guarantees but often result in slow pruning of the search space -- causing repeated expensive single-agent planning calls. Therefore, even though it is possible to leverage domain knowledge and design incomplete M-RAMP-specific CBS constraints to more efficiently prune the search, using these constraints would render the algorithm itself incomplete. This forces practitioners to choose between efficiency and completeness.
  In light of these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, Generalized ECBS, aimed at removing the burden of choice between completeness and efficiency in MAPF algorithms. Our approach enables the use of arbitrary constraints in conflict-based algorithms while preserving completeness and bounding sub-optimality. This enables practitioners to capitalize on the benefits of arbitrary constraints and opens a new space for constraint design in MAPF that has not been explored. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms, propose new "incomplete" constraints, and demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments in M-RAMP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study strategic behavior of project proposers in the context of approval-based participatory budgeting (PB). In our model we assume that the votes are fixed and known and the proposers want to set as high project prices as possible, provided that their projects get selected and the prices are not below the minimum costs of their delivery. We study the existence of pure Nash equilibria (NE) in such games, focusing on the AV/Cost, Phragm\'en, and Method of Equal Shares rules. Furthermore, we report an experimental study of strategic cost selection on real-life PB election data.</description>
