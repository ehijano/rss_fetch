      <title>Unlocking Hidden Information in Sparse Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a powerful technique for probing the nanoscale structure of materials. However, the fundamental limitations of neutron flux pose significant challenges for rapid, high-fidelity data acquisition required in many experiments. To circumvent this difficulty, we introduce a Bayesian statistical framework based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to infer high-quality SANS intensity profiles from measurements with suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Unlike machine learning approaches that depend on extensive training datasets, the proposed one-shot method leverages the intrinsic mathematical properties of the scattering function, smoothness and continuity, offering a generalizable solution beyond the constraints of data-intensive techniques. By examining existing SANS experimental data, we demonstrate that this approach can reduce measurement time by between one and two orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy and adaptability across different SANS instruments. By improving both efficiency and reliability, this method extends the capabilities of SANS, enabling broader applications in time-sensitive and low-flux experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>High Gain and Broadband Metalens Antenna for Terahertz Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) metalens antennas with compact planar structures have demonstrated potential applications in enhancing gain and efficiency through beam convergence. However, the practical applications of THz communications using metalens antennas are impeded due to the lack of collaborative enhancement in both gain and operation bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a high gain and broadband metalens antenna and demonstrate its application for THz communication. This metalens is constructed using a 'sandwich' structure comprising a V-shaped antenna, dielectric layer, and grating, where the resonant design facilitates high polarization conversion efficiency and full phase modulation across a 0 to 2{\pi} range. Experimental results demonstrate that the designed metalens achieve a maximum gain of 36.1 dBi and aperture efficiency of 56.28 % at 0.244 THz with 3 dB gain bandwidth exceeding 33.0 GHz. Furthermore, we developed a prototype system utilizing metalens antennas for THz communication, which reduced the bit error rate (BER) by three orders of magnitude compared with horn antennas and achieved a maximum data rate of 100 Gbps. This proposed metalens offer a high-gain, compact solution for achieving high data rate THz communications, driving advancements in 6G communication network.</description>

      <title>A Novel P-bit-based Probabilistic Computing Approach for Solving the 3-D Protein Folding Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the post-Moore era, the need for efficient solutions to non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) problems is becoming more pressing. In this context, the Ising model implemented by the probabilistic computing systems with probabilistic bits (p-bits) has attracted attention due to the widespread availability of p-bits and support for large-scale simulations. This study marks the first work to apply probabilistic computing to tackle protein folding, a significant NP-complete problem challenge in biology. We represent proteins as sequences of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) beads within a three-dimensional (3-D) grid and introduce a novel many-body interaction-based encoding method to map the problem onto an Ising model. Our simulations show that this approach significantly simplifies the energy landscape for short peptide sequences of six amino acids, halving the number of energy levels. Furthermore, the proposed mapping method achieves approximately 100 times acceleration for sequences consisting of ten amino acids in identifying the correct folding configuration. We predicted the optimal folding configuration for a peptide sequence of 36 amino acids by identifying the ground state. These findings highlight the unique potential of the proposed encoding method for solving protein folding and, importantly, provide new tools for solving similar NP-complete problems in biology by probabilistic computing approach.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced Extreme Events in Hodgkin-Huxley Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme events are rare, large-scale deviations from typical system behavior that can occur in nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we explore the emergence of extreme events within a network of identical stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with mean-field coupling. The neurons are exposed to uncorrelated noise, which introduces stochastic electrical fluctuations that influence their spiking activity. Analyzing the variations in the amplitude of the mean field, we observe a smooth transition from small-amplitude, out-of-sync activity to synchronized spiking activity as the coupling parameter increases, while an abrupt transition occurs with increasing noise intensity. However, beyond a certain threshold, the coupling abruptly suppresses the spiking activity of the network. Our analysis reveals that the influence of noise combined with neuronal coupling near the abrupt transitions can trigger cascades of synchronized spiking activity, identified as extreme events. The analysis of the entropy of the mean field allows us to detect the parameter region where these events occur. We characterize the statistics of these events and find that, as the network size increases, the parameter range where they occur decreases significantly. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms driving extreme events in neural networks and how noise and neural coupling shape collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Non-Radiative Relaxation Dynamics Under Pulsed Excitation Using Photon Absorption Remote Sensing: A Proof-of-Principle Study in Mechanical Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of micro-scale bio-entities are fundamental for understanding their functions and pathological states. However, current methods for assessing elastic properties at single-particle level such as Brillouin and atomic force microscopies exhibit intrinsic limitations, including being often slow, having poor resolution, or involving complicated and invasive setups. In this study, we explore Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) microscopy as a unique solution for mechanical sensing of single micro-objects. PARS uses probe beam scattering/reflectivity measurements to capture non-radiative relaxation process following the absorption of a pulse of light by a micro-object. In particular, we demonstrate that, when operating at GHz-range bandwidth, PARS can trace the sub-nanosecond dynamics of non-radiative relaxation in individual micro-objects, capturing both photoacoustic (PA) pressure propagation and thermal diffusion. This GHz-range measurement, in conjunction with a developed descriptive model, enables the experimental extraction of a minimally distorted PA temporal profile. The PA temporal profile contain information on the ratio between the absorbing object's sound speed and its characteristic diameter, offering a new dimension in PARS microscopy. This enables the assessment of the object's elastic properties, deduced from its speed of sound. Additionally, it offers the potential for sizing objects with known sound speeds. The proof of principle experiments was conducted using spherical polystyrene absorbers, ranging in size from 1 to 10 micrometers with known properties, embedded in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. This technique expands the scope of PARS imaging, opening new perspectives for clinical applications in mechanobiology by demonstrating its potential for mechanical imaging.</description>

      <title>Colossal Dielectric Response and Electric Polarization in Lithium Nitrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with record-breaking properties are interesting as they can redefine existing models. Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powdered samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. When cooling back from $T$$_W$, if the temperature remains above 275 K, $\epsilon$' can be sustained above 10$^4$ and the dissipation factor below 10$^2$. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are the highest amongst all known materials. We suggest the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level. Our results potentially push the boundaries of ceramic capacitors.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Identification of Unbalanced Induction Motor Dynamics and Forces using SINDYc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper identifies the stator currents, torque and unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) of an unbalanced induction motor by the System Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Control (SINDYc) method from time-series data of measurable quantities. The SINDYc model has been trained on data coming from a nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit model for three rotor eccentricity configurations. When evaluating the SINDYc model for static eccentricity, torques and UMPs with excellent accuracies, i.e., 8.8 mNm and 4.87 N of mean absolute error, respectively, are found. When compared with a reference torque equation, this amounts to a 65% error reduction. For dynamic eccentricity, the estimation is more difficult. The SINDYc model is fast enough to be embedded in a control procedure.</description>

      <title>Silicon photonic modulator circuit with programmable intensity and phase modulation response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optical modulators are essential components in optical communication systems. They encode an electrical waveform onto an optical carrier. However, their performance is often limited by inherent electro-optic processes and imperfections in existing integrated designs, which limit their adaptability to diverse applications. This paper presents a circuit-level programmable modulator design that addresses these challenges. The proposed modulator can generate both intensity and phase modulation, optimizing performance without altering the underlying design or constraining platform limitations. We explain and demonstrate the principle with both carrier depletion-based modulators and SiGe electro-absorption modulators on a silicon photonic platform. Experiments demonstrate precise control and optimization capabilities surpassing those of traditional modulator designs, marking a significant leap forward in adaptability and performance enhancement across intensity, phase, and modulation linearity, enabled by programmable photonics. In combination with on-chip monitors, our circuit can be self-calibrating. This programmable modulator circuit concept can be applied to modulators in different platforms, incorporating existing phase shifter designs, and act as a drop-in replacement in more complex circuits. It has the potential to be widely used in optical communication, LiDAR, microwave photonics, and other systems, meeting the increasing demands of various applications.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallic Fe/MgO Superlattice: An Ideal Candidate for Magnetic Tunnel Junction Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) based Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is poised to replace embedded Flash for advanced applications such as automotive microcontroller units. To achieve deeper technological adoption, MTJ needs to exhibit three key features: low magnetization (Ms), high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). Here, we theoretically show that when Fe/MgO multilayers are inserted into the fixed and free layers of the MTJ, these three conditions are simultaneously met. As the number of Fe/MgO multilayers in MTJ electrodes is increased, we find that the electron transport evolves from direct barrier tunneling of majority spin states to the resonant tunneling of minority spin states. Remarkably, the projected density of states (PDOS) of Fe/MgO superlattice at the MgO tunnel barrier exhibits half-metallicity near the Fermi Energy, where the minority states exist while the majority states are gapped out, resulting in astronomically high TMR.</description>

Abstract: The advanced multijunction solar cell (MJSC) has emerged as a frontrunner in photovoltaic literature due to its superior photoconversion efficiency (PCE) owing to its complex fabrication procedure and high costs. This article aims to systematically review the advancements of III-V MJSCs by focusing on computational modelling and experimental fabrication methodologies. In addition, it addresses the technical barriers that have hindered the progression of MJSC technology while also evaluating the current status and prospects of these cells. The findings indicate that III-V MJSCs hold significant promise for space applications. However, advancements in materials science, growth techniques, and structural optimization are crucial for reducing fabrication costs to make these cells more viable for terrestrial use. In this context, alternatives such as perovskite/Si or perovskite/chalcogenide tandem solar cells emerge as viable options. By synthesizing insights from a thorough analysis of recent literature, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, industry practitioners, and newcomers seeking to deepen their understanding of the research methodologies, growth techniques, and the associated challenges and opportunities within the realm of MJSCs.</description>

      <title>Elastic hyperbolic strip lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic properties of elastic lattices defined by tessellations of a hyperbolic strip domain. These strip lattices are generated by a conformal map of tessellations of the hyperbolic disk. Their vibrational modes are organized into three distinct classes: boundary-localized, interior-localized, and global. This mode classification is governed by a localization index quantifying the spatial localization of each mode along the strip's width. We show that, like hyperbolic lattices in the disk, hyperbolic strip lattices exhibit dynamic spectra populated primarily by localized modes. This finding is supported by numerical studies of the dynamics of a strip lattice whose hyperbolically distributed sites are coupled by structural beams. The integrated density of states computation for boundary, interior, and global modes reveals the predominance of localized modes and allows for the identification of spectral bands dominated by particular mode classes. This analysis informs time domain simulations of the lattice response to bandlimited inputs dominated by each mode class. The results illustrate distinctive wave propagation behavior when the excited frequency band is dominated by boundary-localized, interior-localized, or global modes. We experimentally confirm these observations in the frequency and time domains. In the frequency domain, the measured response confirms that the spectral neighborhoods of each excitation are indeed populated by the numerically predicted mode class. We further show that the time-averaged responses are consistent with simulations. Through this work, elastic hyperbolic strips emerge as a new class of lattices with characteristic truss-core architectures and novel nodal arrangements. The considered configuration shows promising capabilities to confine and guide elastic waves along varying spatial regions depending on the excited frequency content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum optics and squeezed light generation have transformed various domains of quantum science and technology. However, real-time quantum dynamics remain an underexplored frontier. Here, we extend quantum optics into the ultrafast regime, providing direct experimental evidence that quantum uncertainty is not a static constraint but evolves dynamically with the system state and interactions. Using ultrafast squeezed light generated via a four-wave mixing nonlinear process, we observe the temporal dynamics of amplitude uncertainty, demonstrating that quantum uncertainty is a controllable and tunable physical quantity. This offers new insights into fundamental quantum mechanics in real-time. Additionally, we demonstrate control over the quantum state of light by switching between amplitude and phase squeezing. Our ability to generate and manipulate ultrafast squeezed light waveforms with attosecond resolution unlocks exciting possibilities for quantum technologies, including petahertz scale secure quantum communication, quantum computing, and ultrafast spectroscopy. We also introduce an ultrafast quantum encryption protocol leveraging squeezed light for secure digital communication at unprecedented speeds. This work paves the way for exploring quantum uncertainty dynamics and establishes the foundation for the emerging field of ultrafast quantum science.</description>
