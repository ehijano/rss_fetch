      <title>Hodge Decomposition Guides the Optimization of Synchronization over Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in synchronization dynamics over "higher-order" network models, optimization theory for such systems is limited. Here, we study a family of Kuramoto models inspired by algebraic topology in which oscillators are coupled over simplicial complexes (SCs) using their associated Hodge Laplacian matrices. We optimize such systems by extending the synchrony alignment function -- an optimization framework for synchronizing graph-coupled heterogeneous oscillators. Computational experiments are given to illustrate how this approach can effectively solve a variety of combinatorial problems including the joint optimization of projected synchronization dynamics onto lower- and upper-dimensional simplices within SCs. We also investigate the role of SC homology and develop bifurcation theory to characterize the extent to which optimal solutions are contained within (or spread across) the three Hodge subspaces. Our work extends optimization theory to the setting of higher-order networks, provides practical algorithms for Hodge-Laplacian-related dynamics including (but not limited to) Kuramoto oscillators, and paves the way for an emerging field that interfaces algebraic topology, combinatorial optimization, and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Criticality from Protected Mean-Field Dynamics: Loop Stability and Internal Renormalization in Reflective Neural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reflective homeostatic dynamics provides a minimal mechanism for self-organized criticality in neural systems. Starting from a reduced stochastic description, we demonstrate within the MSRJD field-theoretic framework that fluctuation effects do not destabilize the critical manifold. Instead, loop corrections are dynamically regularized by homeostatic curvature, yielding a protected mean-field critical surface that remains marginally stable under coarse-graining. Beyond robustness, we show that response-driven structural adaptation generates intrinsic parameter flows that attract the system toward this surface without external fine tuning. Together, these results unify loop renormalization and adaptive response in a single framework and establish a concrete route to autonomous criticality in reentrant neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entrainment of the suprachiasmatic nucleus network by a light-dark cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronization of biological activity with the alternation of day and night (circadian rhythm) is performed in the brain by a group of neurons, constituting the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is divided into two subgroups of oscillating cells: the ventro-lateral (VL) neurons, which are exposed to light (photic signal) and the dorso-medial (DM) neurons which are coupled to the VL cells. When the coupling between these neurons is strong enough, the system synchronizes with the photic period. Upon increasing the cell coupling, the entrainment of the DM cells has been recently shown to occur via a very sharp (jumping) transition when the period of the photic input is larger than the intrinsic period of the cells. Here, we characterize this transition with a simple realistic model. We show that two bifurcations possibly lead to the disappearance of the endogenous mode. Using a mean field model, we show that the jumping transition results from a supercritical Hopf-like bifurcation. This finding implies that both the period and strength of the stimulating photic signal, and the relative fraction of cells in the VL and DM compartments are crucial in determining the synchronization of the system.</description>

      <title>A disease-spread model on hypergraphs with distinct droplet and aerosol transmission modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the spread of an infectious disease, such as one that is caused by a respiratory virus, with two distinct modes of transmission. To do this, we consider a susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) disease on a hypergraph, which allows us to incorporate the effects of both dyadic (i.e., pairwise) and polyadic (i.e., group) interactions on disease propagation. This disease can spread either via large droplets through direct social contacts, which we associate with edges (i.e., hyperedges of size 2), or via infected aerosols in the environment through hyperedges of size at least 3 (i.e., polyadic interactions). We derive mean-field approximations of our model for two types of hypergraphs, and we obtain threshold conditions that characterize whether the disease dies out or becomes endemic. Additionally, we numerically simulate our model and a mean-field approximation of it to examine the impact of various factors, such as hyperedge size (when the size is uniform), hyperedge-size distribution (when the sizes are nonuniform), and hyperedge-recovery rates (when the sizes are nonuniform) on the disease dynamics.</description>
