      <title>First detection of variable radio emission originating from the infant planetary system V1298 Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V1298 Tau is a very young and magnetically active star which hosts a benchmark multi-planetary system to study planet formation and evolutionary history at the earliest stages. We selected V1298 Tau for a first targeted follow-up at radio frequencies with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Telescope (JVLA), the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), and the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT), to search for emission in the overall frequency range 0.55-7.2 GHz. Detecting radio emission from such a very active star is key to characterise its magnetosphere, allowing in principle to probe the strength of the coronal magnetic field and plasma density. Observations were carried out between Oct 2023 and Sept 2024: three epochs with uGMRT band-4 (0.55-0.75 GHz), 12 epochs with the JVLA using L (1-2 GHz) and C (4.5-6.5 GHz) bands, and three epochs with SRT using C-high band (6-7.2 GHz). We report the first detection of radio emission from V1298 Tau at different epochs using the JVLA. The emission has maximum peak flux densities of 91$\pm$10 and 177$\pm$6 $\mu$Jy/beam in the L- and C-band, respectively. From a comparison with contemporary optical photometry, we found that the detected emission with the highest fluxes are located around a phase of minimum of the photospheric light curve. Although the uGMRT and SRT observations could not detect the source, we measured 3$\sigma$ flux density upper limits in the range ~41-56 $\mu$Jy/beam using uGMRT, while with SRT we reached upper limits down to 13 mJy. The lack of a significant fraction of circular polarisation indicates that the observed flux is not due to electron cyclotron maser emission from star-planet interaction, and it is likely produced by gyrosynchroton/cyclotron emission from the corona triggered by stellar magnetic activity, although we cannot exclude thermal emission due to a lack of constraints on the brightness temperature.</description>

      <title>Polar circumtriple planets and disks around misaligned hierarchical triple stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of hierarchical triple star systems show that misalignments are common both between the angular momentum vector of the inner binary and the outer companion orbit, and between the outer binary orbit and a circumtriple gas disk. With analytic methods and n-body simulations we explore the dynamics of circumtriple orbits around a misaligned hierarchical triple star. Circumtriple test particle orbits nodally precess either about the outer binary angular momentum vector (circulating orbits) or about a stationary inclination that depends upon the binary properties (librating orbits). For a coplanar (or retrograde coplanar) triple star, the apsidal precession rate is maximal and the critical orbital radius outside of which all orbits are circulating is minimal. Polar alignment of a circumtriple gas disk requires nodal libration and therefore it can be more likely if there is a large misalignment between the inner and outer binary orbits. There are two values of the mutual misalignment, i_c and 180-i_c, for which the apsidal precession rate of the triple star is zero and polar alignment is possible at all orbital radii. For a circular inner binary orbit i_c=55, and it changes with eccentricity of the inner binary while being insensitive to other triple star parameters.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Biomolecules Detectable in Near-Surface Ice on Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06971v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europa, Jupiter's second Galilean moon, is believed to host a subsurface ocean in contact with a rocky mantle, where hydrothermal activity may drive the synthesis of organic molecules. Of these molecules, abiotic synthesis of aromatic amino acids is unlikely, and their detection on Europa could be considered a biosignature. Fluorescence from aromatic amino acids, with characteristic emissions in the 200-400 nanometer wavelength range, can be induced by a laser and may be detectable where ocean material has been relatively recently emplaced on Europa's surface, as indicated by geologically young terrain and surface features. However, surface bombardment by charged particles from the Jovian magnetosphere and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation degrades organic molecules, limiting their longevity. We model radiolysis and photolysis of aromatic amino acids embedded in ice, showing dependencies on hemispheric and latitudinal patterns of charged particle bombardment and ice phase. We demonstrate that biosignatures contained within freshly deposited ice in high-latitude regions on the surface of Europa are detectable using laser-induced UV fluorescence, even from an orbiting spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Retrograde predominance of small saturnian moons reiterates a recent retrograde collisional disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and careful orbital determination of 64 new irregular moons of Saturn found in images taken using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from 2019-2021, bringing the total number of saturnian irregulars to 122. By more than doubling the sample of saturnian irregular moon orbits, including pushing to smaller sizes, we can now see finer detail in their orbital distribution. We note the emergence of potential subgroups associated with each of Siarnaq and Kiviuq within the Inuit group. We find that in the inclination range 157-172 degrees the ratio of smaller moons (diameters less than 4 km) to larger moons (diameters greater than 4 km) is significantly larger than that of any other inclination range in the retrogrades. We denote this subset of the Norse group as the Mundilfari subgroup after its largest member. The incredibly steep slope of the Mundilfari subgroup's size distribution, with a differential power law index of q = 6, points to this subgroup being created by a recent catastrophic collision proposed in Ashton et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Measuring the degree of clustering and diffusion of trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outer solar system is populated by a broad aggregate of minor bodies, which occupy orbits whose dynamical character ranges from long-term stable to rapidly diffusive. We investigate the chaotic properties of known distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) by numerically integrating TNO clones and statistically analyzing their orbital diffusion. Comparing the measured diffusion with an analytical criterion yields a dynamically motivated separation into classes of stable, metastable and unstable objects. We then measure the level of clustering of the longitudes of perihelia and of the orbital poles, as functions of orbital distance and of their stability properties. Distant (meta)stable objects appear increasingly clustered in perihelion around $\varpi \sim 50^\circ$ for increasing semi-major axis, while the orbits of unstable objects are well described by two, roughly equally-populated groups of "clustered" and "anti-clustered" objects, with means around $\sim 25^\circ$ and $\sim 205^\circ$ respectively. We further find that, compared to the solar system's total angular momentum vector, the mean orbital poles of distant TNOs are significantly more misaligned for (meta)stable objects, while they remain roughly aligned for unstable objects. TNOs with intermediate orbital periods also appear to be misaligned with respect to the forced plane predicted by secular theory with the known planets. This gradation based on stability, if validated further by the upcoming VRO survey, necessitates a dynamical explanation.</description>

      <title>Double ellipsoidal harmonic gravity field models for bilobed bodies: Example of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilobed bodies represent a significant class of small extraterrestrial objects in the Solar System. We present a double harmonic-series approach to model the gravity of the lobes separately, thereby allowing their mass distributions to be constrained independently. We study an exemplary candidate contact binary, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and establish two ellipsoidal harmonic series referred to the closest-bounding, non-overlapping ellipsoids of the respective lobes. We show that the model is more robust near the irregular body shape than a global spherical harmonic series, which is a customary product determined from spacecraft tracking. While they can be estimated directly from measurements, we demonstrate here that the double series can also be transformed from an existing spherical harmonic model by means of decomposition. We use simulations to analyze model solutions for a few heterogeneous mass distributions.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared absorption spectra and mass absorption coefficients for 23 chondrites: dependence on composition and grain size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present mid-infrared transmission spectra from 2 to 23 microns of the 23 Atacama Desert chondrites of different types (carbonaceous Ornans and ordinary of H, L, and LL groups) as well as of some pure minerals (olivine and diopside). We focus on the characteristics of silicate at 10 and 20 microns, analyzing the influence of composition and grain size on peak strengths and spectral shapes. We present the first results of the Cosmic Dust Laboratory, a dedicated facility at the Universidad Diego Portales equipped with a VERTEX 80v vacuum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Through milling and sieving samples, we obtained different ranges of particle sizes to study the effect of grain size on the intensity and shape of the spectrum. The resulting spectral library can be compared with astronomical data of protoplanetary disks, debris disks, and even white dwarf disks obtained with instruments such as MIRI on board the James Webb Space Telescope and MATISSE on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We also present mass absorption coefficient values, which can be used for radiative transfer modeling of astronomical observations. This study aims to improve dust opacities for astronomical applications, with a focus on circumstellar disks.</description>

      <title>TESS and HARPS-N unveil two planets transiting TOI-1453. A super-Earth and one of the lowest mass sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the validation and characterisation of two transiting planets around TOI-1453, a K-dwarf star in the TESS northern continuous viewing zone. In addition to the TESS data, we used ground-based photometric, spectroscopic, and high-resolution imaging follow-up observations to validate the two planets. We obtained 100 HARPS-N high-resolution spectra over two seasons and used them together with the TESS light curve to constrain the mass, radius, and orbit of each planet.
  TOI-1453 b is a super-Earth with an orbital period of $P_b$=4.314 days, a radius of $R_b$=1.17$\pm$0.06$R_{\oplus}$, and a mass lower than 2.32$M_{\oplus}$ (99$\%$). TOI-1453 c is a sub-Neptune with a period of $P_c$=6.589 days, radius of $R_c$=2.22$\pm$0.09$R_{\oplus}$, and mass of $M_c$=2.95$\pm$0.84$M_{\oplus}$. The two planets orbit TOI-1453 with a period ratio close to 3/2, although they are not in a mean motion resonance (MMR) state. We did not detect any transit timing variations in our attempt to further constrain the planet masses. TOI-1453 c has a very low bulk density and is one of the least massive sub-Neptunes discovered to date. It is compatible with having either a water-rich composition or a rocky core surrounded by a thick H/He atmosphere. However, we set constraints on the water mass fraction in the envelope according to either a water-rich or water-poor formation scenario. The star TOI-1453 belongs to the Galactic thin disc based on Gaia kinematics and has a sub-solar metallicity. This system is orbited by a fainter stellar companion at a projected distance of about 150 AU, classifying TOI-1453 b and c of S-type planets. These various planetary and stellar characteristics make TOI-1453 a valuable system for understanding the origin of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in protoplanetary disks: A systematic analysis of dust settling in 33 disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The level of dust vertical settling and radial dust concentration in disks is of critical importance for understanding the efficiency of planet formation. We present the first uniform analysis of the vertical extent of millimeter dust for a representative sample of 33disks. We used radiative transfer modeling of archival high-angular-resolution (&lt;=0.1") ALMA dust observations of inclined and ringed disks to estimate their vertical dust scale height, which was compared to estimated gas scale heights to characterize the level of vertical sedimentation. In all 23systems for which constraints could be obtained, we find that the outer parts of the disks are vertically settled. 5disks allow for the characterization of the dust scale height both within and outside approximately half the dust disk radius, showing a lower limit on their dust heights at smaller radii. This implies that the ratio between vertical turbulence and the Stokes number, $\alpha_z/\St$, decreases radially in these sources. For 21rings in 15disks, we also constrained the level of radial concentration of the dust, finding that about half of the rings are compatible with strong radial trapping. In most of these rings, vertical turbulence is found to be comparable to or weaker than radial turbulence, which is incompatible with the turbulence generated by the vertical shear instability at these locations. We further used our dust settling constraints to estimate the turbulence level under the assumption that the dust size is limited by fragmentation, finding typical upper limits around $\alpha_\text{frag}\leq10^{-3}$. In a few sources, we find that turbulence cannot be the main source of accretion. In the context of pebble accretion, we identify several disk regions that have upper limits on their dust concentration that would allow core formation to proceed efficiently, even at wide orbital distances outside of 50au.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Infrared Excess of SIPS J2045-6332: Evidence for a Young Stellar Object with Potential Low-Mass Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Disk Detective project, a citizen science initiative, aims to identify circumstellar discs around stars by detecting objects with infrared (IR) excess using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). In this study, we investigate SIPS J2045-6332, a potential brown dwarf with significant IR excess in WISE and 2MASS bands, initially identified by project volunteers. Despite early indicators of a circumstellar disc, discrepancies between observed brightness and expected Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) models suggested unusual properties. To explore potential explanations, we created SED templates for spectral types M9 to L4 and compared them with SIPS J2045-6332's photometric data, revealing an excess brightness that points to either an unresolved low-mass companion or a young, inflated primary star. Further analysis of infrared spectral features and surface gravity indicators supports a youthful classification, estimating the object's age at 26-200 million years. Observations also suggest the presence of a mid L-type companion at a projected distance of 6.7 AU. This study highlights SIPS J2045-6332 as an intriguing system with unique IR characteristics and recommends follow-up observations with high-resolution telescopes to confirm the companion hypothesis and further characterize the system.</description>

      <title>Will LAGEOS and LARES 2 succeed in accurately measuring frame-dragging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current LAGEOS-LARES 2 experiment aims to accurately measure the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitomagnetic field of the spinning Earth generated by the latter's angular momentum $\boldsymbol{J}$. The key quantity to a priori analytically assess the overall systematic uncertainty is the ratio $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$ of the sum of the classical precessions of the satellites' nodes $\Omega$ induced by the Earth's oblateness $J_2$ to the sum of their post-Newtonian counterparts. $In$ $principle$, if the sum of the inclinations $I$ of both satellites were $exactly$ $180^\circ$, the semimajor axes $a$ and the eccentricities $e$ being $identical$, $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$ would $exactly$ vanish. Actually, it is $not$ so by a large amount because of the departures of the $real$ satellites' orbital configurations from their $ideal$ ones. Thus, $J_2$ impacts not only directly through its own uncertainty, but also $indirectly$ through the errors in all the other physical and orbital parameters entering $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$. The consequences of this fact are examined in greater details than done so far in the literature. The Van Patten and Everitt's proposal in 1976 of looking at the sum of the node precessions of two counter-orbiting spacecraft in (low-altitude) circular polar orbits is revamped rebranding it POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES).

      <title>Occurrence rates of accreting companions from a new method to compute emission-line survey sensitivity: application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alphaline luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-7 &lt; log MMdot &lt;-3) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Using our two accretion models, we find consistent protoplanet rates, with median and 68% credible intervals of 0.16 (+0.19, -0.10) and 0.22 (+0.26, -0.14) accreting companions per star, respectively. Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that circumstellar disks exhibit weak turbulence, with their dynamics and evolution being primarily influenced by magnetic winds. However, most numerical studies have focused on planet-disk interactions in turbulent disk models. We aim to explore how wind-driven accretion affects the orbital and eccentricity evolution of a Jovian planet within a magnetized disk. Conversely, we seek to determine in what extent such a planet can modify the accretion behavior and the wind dynamics. We perform high-resolution 3D global non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a massive gap-carving planet interacting with a wind-launching disk, using the accelerated code IDEFIX. We consider the influence of the gap shape on planet migration by restarting a "fixed-planet" simulation at three different times, from which the planet evolves freely in the disk. For a strong initial magnetization and a sufficiently deep planet gap, we find that the planet becomes moderately eccentric, and its migration is slow, unsteady and mostly outward. This migration pattern is due to the gap's radial asymmetry which enhances the inner Lindblad torque while reducing the outer Lindblad torque. We show that eccentricity can grow up to 6-8% and is likely driven by a finite-amplitude instability triggered by first-order external Lindblad resonances. These moderate eccentricity values periodically modulate the gap accretion rate and wind mass loss rate, possibly leading to the formation of discrete structures in CO outflows. Slow outward migration and eccentricity growth appear to be common outcomes of planet-disk-wind interactions, which may contribute significantly to both the long orbital periods and the moderate eccentricities of warm jupiters. Additionally, eccentric massive protoplanets embedded in circumstellar disks could play a role in generating structured outflows.</description>

      <title>Identification of a turnover in the initial mass function of a young stellar cluster down to 0.5 M$_{J}$</title>

Abstract: A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M$_{J}$. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be near 1-10 M$_{J}$. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. We present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M$_{J}$ within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 $\mu$m, we identified several free floating objects down to roughly 3 M$_{J}$ with sensitivity to 0.5 M$_{J}$. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M$_{J}$ to roughly 12 M$_{J}$, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M$_{J}$. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M$_{J}$.</description>
