      <title>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of pure-state trajectories, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid model for rotating annular supersolids and its experimental implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous two-fluid model of finite-temperature superfluids has been recently extended to de- scribe the mixed classical-superfluid dynamics of the newly discovered supersolid phase of matter. We show that for rigidly rotating supersolids one can derive a more appropriate single-fluid model, in which the seemingly classical and superfluid contributions to the motion emerge from a spatially varying phase of the global wavefunction. That allows to design experimental protocols to excite and detect the peculiar rotation dynamics of annular supersolids, including partially quantized supercurrents, in which each atom brings less than $\hbar$ unit of angular momentum. Our results are valid for a more general class of density-modulated superfluids.</description>

      <title>Generalized spheroidal wave equation for real and complex valued parameters. An algorithm based on the analytic derivatives for the eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for the computation of eigenvalues of the generalized spheroidal wave equations. The novelty of the present method is in the use of the analytical derivatives of the eigenvalues to minimize losses in accuracy. The derivatives are constructed in the form of three-term recurrent relations within the method of continued fractions associated with the corresponding spheroidal wave equation. Very accurate results for the eigenvalues are obtained for a wide range of the parameters of the problem. As an illustrative example, the electronic energies and the separation constants are computed for various electronic states and geometries of selected ($\rm{H}_2^{+}$, $\rm{HeH}^{2+}$, and $\rm{BH}^{5+}$) quasimolecular systems. The computations for high lying ${}^{2}\Sigma$ electronic states of $\rm{H}_2^{+}$ up to very large internuclear separations ($ \leq 1.7 \times 10^5$ au) are presented. Also presented the computations for the eigenvalues of the generalized spheroidal wave equations with complex valued parameters. The agreement between the obtained results and the results of other authors is discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>Atoms and Molecules as Quantum Attosecond Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancing temporal resolution in computation, signal modulation, and measurement is crucial for pushing the frontiers of modern science and technology. Optical resonators have recently demonstrated computational operations at frequencies beyond the gigahertz range, surpassing conventional electronics, yet remain constrained by an inherent trade-off between temporal resolution and operation time -- limiting performance to the picosecond scale. Here we show that atoms and molecules can overcome this limitation, enabling attosecond-level temporal resolution with over 100,000-fold higher precision than state-of-the-art optical resonators while sustaining long operation times. When resonantly driven, these systems naturally perform temporal integration of the incident field envelope -- a process verified by solving the Bloch equations using four independent formulations in excellent agreement with analytic predictions. We identify feasible atomic transitions and excitation schemes realizable with current technology. Furthermore, we suggest techniques to differentiate and generate waveforms at such resolution. These results establish a new paradigm for attosecond-resolution optical computation, signal modulation, and ultrafast control in atomic and quantum systems.</description>
