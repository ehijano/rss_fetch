      <title>Re-framing the classification of ideals in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, given the Balmer spectrum of any essentially small monoidal-triangulated category, one has a classification of semiprime thick tensor ideals arising in terms of a "pseudo-Hochster-dual" of the noncommutative Balmer spectrum. This extends Balmer's classification of radical thick tensor ideals to noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry. To achieve this, we utilize the notion of support data for lattices and frames, under which the classification is a consequence of Stone duality. We also give a characterization for when the noncommutative Balmer spectrum behaves as it does in tensor-triangular geometry, that is, when it is a spectral space with quasi-compact opens given by complements of supports, and show that rigid centrally generated monoidal-triangulated categories satisfy this property.</description>

      <title>Comparing loose bimodules and double barrels using pseudo-models of enhanced sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Pseudo) double categories have two sorts of morphisms: tight ones which compose strictly, and loose ones which compose up to coherent isomorphism. In this paper, we consider bimodules between double categories in the loose direction. We provide two formulation of this concept -- first as pseudo-bimodules between pseudo-categories in the 2-category of categories, and second as double barrels generalizing Joyal's definition of bimodules between categories as functors into the walking arrow -- and prove these two formulations equivalent. In order to prove this equivalence, we define a notion of \emph{pseudo-model} of an enhanced sketch, which may be of independent interest. We then consider some double category theory unlocked by the theory of loose bimodules: loose adjunctions, and loose limits.</description>

      <title>Duality in tensor-triangular geometry via proxy-smallness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make a systematic study of duality phenomena in tensor-triangular geometry, generalising and complementing previous results of Balmer--Dell'Ambrogio--Sanders and Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar. A key feature of our approach is the use of proxy-smallness to remove assumptions on functors preserving compact objects, and to this end we introduce proxy-small geometric functors and establish their key properties. Given such a functor, we classify the rigid objects in its associated torsion category, giving a new perspective on results of Benson--Iyengar--Krause--Pevtsova. As a consequence, we show that any proxy-small geometric functor satisfies Grothendieck duality on a canonical subcategory of objects, irrespective of whether its right adjoint preserves compact objects. We use this as a tool to classify Matlis dualising objects and to provide a suitable generalisation of the Gorenstein ring spectra of Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar in tensor-triangular geometry. We illustrate the framework developed with various examples and applications, showing that it captures Matlis duality and Gorenstein duality in commutative algebra, duality phenomena in chromatic and equivariant stable homotopy theory, and Watanabe's theorem in polynomial invariant theory.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fibrations in Higher Topos Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to put the theory of approximate fibrations into the framework of higher topos theory. We define the notion of an approximate fibration for a general geometric morphism of $\infty$-topoi, give several characterizations in terms of shape theory and compare it to the original definition for maps of topological spaces of Coram and Duvall. Furthermore, we revisit the notion of cell-like maps between topoi, and generalize Lurie's shape-theoretic characterization by giving a purely topos-theoretical proof.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries and Fiber Functors from Multiple Gaugeable Homomorphisms from 6D ${\cal N}=(2,0)$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the symmetry topological field theory/topological order correspondence (SymTFT/TO), together with the higher-categorical structure of 6D N =(2,0) SCFTs, we prove that the total quantum dimension of the relative gaugeable algebra leading to intrinsic non-invertible symmetries between class S theories is greater with respect to the non-intrinsic case. From a higher-categorical perspective, this supports the idea that multiplicity is allowed to exceed unity in some superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Level Inequalities for Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for all noetherian rings, the level of any homologically bounded complex $M$ with respect to the collection of projective or injective modules is bounded above by the projective dimension of $\bigoplus H(M)$ plus one or the injective dimemsion of $\bigoplus H(M)$ plus one, respectively. In addition, we also prove that if $\mathsf{C}$ is the collection of flat, Gorenstein projective, Gorenstein injective, or Gorenstein flat modules, then the level of any homologically bounded complex $M$ is bounded above by the maximum of 2 or the $\mathsf{C}$-dimension of $\bigoplus H(M)$ plus 1. These results give universal bounds for the projective, injective, and flat levels over regular local rings, and give universal bounds for the Gorenstein projective, Gorenstein injective, and Gorenstein flat levels over Gorenstein local rings. As an application of the above results, we prove a version of the Bass Formula for complexes with respect to injective level and Gorenstein injective level. We also show that the bounds achieved for each homological and Gorenstein homological level considered is optimal.</description>
