      <title>Outer Contour-driven Ruled Surface Generation for Linear Hot-wire Rough Machining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate a small set of ruled surfaces that do not collide with the input shape for linear hot-wire rough machining. Central to our technique is a new observation: the ruled surfaces constructed by vertical extrusion from planar smooth curves, which approach the input shape's outer contour lines while having no collisions, are capable of removing materials effectively during rough machining. Accordingly, we develop an iterative algorithm that alternates in each iteration between computing a viewpoint to determine an outer contour line and optimizing a smooth curve to approximate that contour line under the collision-free constraint. Specifically, a view selection approach based on genetic algorithm is used to optimize the viewpoint for removing materials as much as possible, and present an adaptive algorithm to find the constrained curves. The feasibility and practicability of our method are demonstrated through 10 physical examples. Compared with manual designs, our method obtains lower errors with the same number of cuts.</description>

      <title>The Price of Connectivity Augmentation on Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two classes of graphs, $\mathcal{G}_1\subseteq \mathcal{G}_2$, and a $c$-connected graph $G\in \mathcal{G}_1$, we wish to augment $G$ with a smallest cardinality set of new edges $F$ to obtain a $k$-connected graph $G'=(V,E\cup F) \in \mathcal{G}_2$. In general, this is the $c\to k$ connectivity augmentation problem. Previous research considered variants where $\mathcal{G}_1=\mathcal{G}_2$ is the class of planar graphs, plane graphs, or planar straight-line graphs. In all three settings, we prove that the $c\to k$ augmentation problem is NP-complete when $2\leq c&lt;k\leq 5$.
  However, the connectivity of the augmented graph $G'$ is at most $5$ if $\mathcal{G}_2$ is limited to planar graphs. We initiate the study of the $c\to k$ connectivity augmentation problem for arbitrary $k\in \mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal{G}_1$ is the class of planar graphs, plane graphs, or planar straight-line graphs, and $\mathcal{G}_2$ is a beyond-planar class of graphs: $\ell$-planar, $\ell$-plane topological, or $\ell$-plane geometric graphs. We obtain tight bounds on the tradeoffs between the desired connectivity $k$ and the local crossing number $\ell$ of the augmented graph $G'$. We also show that our hardness results apply to this setting.
  The connectivity augmentation problem for triangulations is intimately related to edge flips; and the minimum augmentation problem to the flip distance between triangulations. We prove that it is NP-complete to find the minimum flip distance between a given triangulation and a 4-connected triangulation, settling an open problem posed in 2014, and present an EPTAS for this problem.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Dynamic Steiner Spanners for Constant-Curvature Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Steiner spanners in Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries. In the Euclidean setting, a recent line of work initiated by Le and Solomon [FOCS'19] and further improved by Chang et al. [SoCG'24] obtained Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners of size $O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\log(1/\varepsilon)n)$, nearly matching the lower bounds of Bhore and T\'oth [SIDMA'22].
  We obtain Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners of size $O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\log(1/\varepsilon)n)$ not only in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, but also in $d$-dimensional spherical and hyperbolic space. For any fixed dimension $d$, the obtained edge count is optimal up to an $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ factor in each of these spaces. Unlike earlier constructions, our Steiner spanners are based on simple quadtrees, and they can be dynamically maintained, leading to efficient data structures for dynamic approximate nearest neighbours and bichromatic closest pair.
  In the hyperbolic setting, we also show that $2$-spanners in the hyperbolic plane must have $\Omega(n\log n)$ edges, and we obtain a $2$-spanner of size $O_d(n\log n)$ in $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space, matching our lower bound for any constant $d$. Finally, we give a Steiner spanner with additive error $\varepsilon$ in hyperbolic space with $O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\log(\alpha(n)/\varepsilon)n)$ edges, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
  Our techniques generalize to closed orientable surfaces of constant curvature as well as to some quotient spaces.</description>

      <title>Arcs with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A curve $\gamma$ that connects $s$ and $t$ has the increasing chord property if $|bc| \leq |ad|$ whenever $a,b,c,d$ lie in that order on $\gamma$. For planar curves, the length of such a curve is known to be at most $2\pi/3 \cdot |st|$. Here we examine the question in higher dimensions and from the algorithmic standpoint and show the following:
  (I) The length of any $s-t$ curve with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is at most $2 \cdot \left( e/2 \cdot (d+4) \right)^{d-1} \cdot |st|$ for every $d \geq 3$. This is the first bound in higher dimensions.
  (II) Given a polygonal chain $P=(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$ in $\mathbf{R}^d$, where $d \geq 4$, $k =\lfloor d/2 \rfloor$, it can be tested whether it satisfies the increasing chord property in $O\left(n^{2-1/(k+1)} {\rm polylog} (n) \right)$ expected time. This is the first subquadratic algorithm in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Evaluate Neighbor Search for Curve-based Vector Field Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curve-based representations, particularly integral curves, are often used to represent large-scale computational fluid dynamic simulations. Processing and analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space, popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap, this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings that were overlooked by the community.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE) of 2D Black Box Classifier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately estimating decision boundaries in black box systems is critical when ensuring safety, quality, and feasibility in real-world applications. However, existing methods iteratively refine boundary estimates by sampling in regions of uncertainty, without providing guarantees on the closeness to the decision boundary and also result in unnecessary exploration that is especially disadvantageous when evaluations are costly. This paper presents $\varepsilon$-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE), a sample efficient and function-agnostic algorithm that leverages the intermediate value theorem to estimate the location of the decision boundary of a black box binary classifier within a user-specified $\varepsilon$-neighborhood. To demonstrate applicability, a case study is presented of an electric grid stability problem with uncertain renewable power injection. Evaluations are conducted on three test functions, where it is seen that the EDGE algorithm demonstrates superior sample efficiency and better boundary approximation than adaptive sampling techniques and grid-based searches.</description>

      <title>A New Geometric Representation for 3D Bijective Mappings and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) mappings are fundamental in various scientific and engineering applications, including computer-aided engineering (CAE), computer graphics, and medical imaging. They are typically represented and stored as three-dimensional coordinates to which each vertex is mapped. With this representation, manipulating 3D mappings while preserving desired properties becomes challenging. In this work, we present a novel geometric representation for 3D bijective mappings, termed 3D quasiconformality (3DQC), which generalizes the concept of Beltrami coefficients from 2D to 3D spaces. This geometric representation facilitates the scientific computation of 3D mapping problems by capturing local geometric properties in 3D mappings. We derive a partial differential equation (PDE) that links the 3DQC to its corresponding mapping. This PDE is discretized into a symmetric positive-definite linear system, which can be efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. 3DQC offers a powerful tool for manipulating 3D mappings while maintaining their desired geometric properties. Leveraging 3DQC, we develop numerical algorithms for sparse modeling and numerical interpolation of bijective 3D mappings, facilitating the efficient processing, storage, and manipulation of complex 3D mappings while ensuring bijectivity. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Data Structures for Range Sorted Consecutive Occurrence Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The string indexing problem is a fundamental computational problem with numerous applications, including information retrieval and bioinformatics. It aims to efficiently solve the pattern matching problem: given a text T of length n for preprocessing and a pattern P of length m as a query, the goal is to report all occurrences of P as substrings of T. Navarro and Thankachan [CPM 2015, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2016] introduced a variant of this problem called the gap-bounded consecutive occurrence query, which reports pairs of consecutive occurrences of P in T such that their gaps (i.e., the distances between them) lie within a query-specified range [g_1, g_2]. Recently, Bille et al. [FSTTCS 2020, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2022] proposed the top-k close consecutive occurrence query, which reports the k closest consecutive occurrences of P in T, sorted in non-decreasing order of distance. Both problems are optimally solved in query time with O(n \log n)-space data structures. In this paper, we generalize these problems to the range query model, which focuses only on occurrences of P in a specified substring T[a.. b] of T. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose an O(n \log^2 n)-space data structure that answers the range top-k consecutive occurrence query in O(m + \log\log n + k) time and can be built in O(n \log^3 n) time; and (2) We propose an O(n \log^{2+\epsilon} n)-space data structure that answers the range gap-bounded consecutive occurrence query in O(m + \log\log n + output) time and can be constructed in O(n \log^{5/2}n) time, where \epsilon is a positive constant and output denotes the number of outputs. As by-products, we present algorithms for geometric problems involving weighted horizontal segments in a 2D plane, which are of independent interest. Furthermore, we observe that consecutive occurrences are related to closed substrings of a string.</description>

      <title>Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces via Generalized Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</description>

      <title>Pathwidth of 2-Layer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bipartite graph $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar graph if it admits a drawing on the plane such that the vertices in $X$ and $Y$ are placed on two parallel lines respectively, edges are drawn as straight-line segments, and every edge involves at most $k$ crossings. Angelini, Da Lozzo, F\"orster, and Schneck [GD 2020; Comput. J., 2024] showed that every 2-layer $k$-planar graph has pathwidth at most $k + 1$. In this paper, we show that this bound is sharp by giving a 2-layer $k$-planar graph with pathwidth $k + 1$ for every $k \geq 0$. This improves their lower bound of $(k+3)/2$.</description>

      <title>Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins using physically-motivated potentials for non-polar interactions, can identify the biologically correct assembly as the energy-minimizing state. Short-range potentials, however, produce rugged energy landscapes, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy.
  This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Push-1 is PSPACE-complete, and the automated verification of motion planning gadgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Push-1 is one of the simplest abstract frameworks for motion planning; however, the complexity of deciding if a Push-1 problem can be solved was a several-decade-old open question. We resolve the complexity of the motion planning problem Push-1 by showing that it is PSPACE-complete, and we formally verify the correctness of our constructions. Our results build upon a recent work which demonstrated that Push-1F (a variant of Push-1 with fixed blocks) and Push-k for $k \geq 2$ (a variant of Push-1 where the agent can push $k$ blocks at once) are PSPACE-complete and more generally on the motion-planning-though-gadgets framework.
  In the process of resolving this open problem, we make two general contributions to the motion planning complexity theory. First, our proof technique extends the standard motion planning framework by assigning the agent a state. This state is preserved when traversing between gadgets but can change when taking transitions in gadgets. Second, we designed and implemented a system, GADGETEER, for computationally verifying the behavior of systems of gadgets. This system is agnostic to the underlying motion planning problem, and allows for formally verifying the correspondence between a low-level construction and a high-level system of gadgets as well as automatically synthesizing gadgets from low-level constructions. In the case of Push-1, we use this system to formally prove that our constructions match our high-level specifications of their behavior. This culminates in the construction and verification of a self-closing door, as deciding reachability in a system of self-closing doors is PSPACE-complete.</description>
