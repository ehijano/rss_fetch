      <title>Pseudogap, Fermi liquid, Van Hove singularity and maxima of the compressibility and of the Knight shift as a function of doping in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative changes in thermodynamic and single-particle properties characterize the transition between the pseudogapped electronic liquid and the Fermi liquid. Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $\kappa(\delta)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $\delta$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $\kappa(\delta)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $\kappa(\delta)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(\pi,\pi)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $\omega=0$. The Knight shift, $\chi_{sp}(0,0)(\delta)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U &lt; U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $\delta_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $\delta=\delta_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Approach to Elementary Excitations and Magnetization Plateaus in an S=1/2 XX Hybrid Trimer-Dimer Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the elementary excitations and magnetization of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX chain comprising trimer-dimer units (the J1-J1-J2-J3-J2 topology) under a transverse magnetic field h. Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbital liquids provide an exactly solvable route to three-dimensional Z2 quantum spin liquids beyond the original Kitaev setting. Built from higher-dimensional Clifford-algebra representations, spin-orbital Hamiltonians can be realized on both three- and four-coordinated lattices, giving rise to phases with 3 and 2 itinerant Majorana flavors. We demonstrate that these models host a rich set of gapless Majorana metals, characterized, in particular, by topological Fermi surfaces, nodal lines, and Weyl semimetal phases. We analyze the stability of these structures under physically motivated perturbations and identify generic splitting patterns and topological transitions driven by symmetry breaking and flavor mixing. This yields a unified organizing framework for three-dimensional Majorana metals in fractionalized spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations in the iron pnictide NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements in model one-dimensional (1D) correlated systems offer insights for understanding their two-dimensional counterparts, which include the cuprate and iron pnictide/chalcogenide superconductors. A major challenge is the identification of such correlated systems with dominantly 1D physics. In this work, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As single crystal directly reveal quasi-1D spin excitations, resulting from atomic order that lead to magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Cu chains. The dominant exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic along the chain ($SJ_{\rm \parallel}\approx90.1(3)$~meV), whereas the inter-chain couplings are much weaker ($SJ_{\rm \perp}\approx-2.4(1)$~meV and $SJ_{\rm c}\approx0.15(5)$~meV). The quasi-1D spin excitations in NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As stem from both the N\'eel and stripe vectors, with N\'eel excitations sensitive to Fe impurities on the Cu site. The spin excitations in quasi-1D NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As and quasi-2D FeSe exhibit a striking resemblance, suggesting a common origin for their coexistent stripe and N\'eel excitations. Our findings demonstrate magnetic dilution in NaFeAs leads to dimension reduction of its magnetic degree of freedom, presenting a strategy for discovering low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Chiral topological semimetals hosting multifold fermions and exotic surface states represent a frontier in topological materials research. Among them, noncentrosymmetric cubic B20 compounds-notably transition-metal silicides and germanides-offer a unique platform for realizing symmetry-protected topological phases and unconventional optoelectronic responses. Here, we report the physical properties of RhGe and CoGe single crystals with B20 structure in detail. Transport measurements reveal metallic behavior with characteristic Fermi-liquid scaling at low temperatures, while magnetization results confirm paramagnetism in both compounds. In addition, both of materials exhibit low carrier concentrations with small electronic specific heat coefficient, indicating their semimetal feature with weak electronic correlations. Such high-quality CoGe and RhGe single crystals provide a material platform to explore the evolution of multifold fermions and the instability of helicoid-arc surface states with spin-orbit coupling and surface environment in B20 material systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Electronic Structure and Spin-State Crossover in LaCoO3 Using Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying electronic structure and spin-state transitions, as it reveals changes in the orbital configuration accompanying a spin-state crossover. In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3.</description>

      <title>Charge-$4e$ superconductor with parafermionic vortices: A path to universal topological quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\nu=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.</description>

      <title>U(1) lattice gauge theory and string roughening on a triangular Rydberg array</title>

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal L\"uscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the first-order hydrodynamic transport coefficients (shear viscosity $\eta$, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, and charge conductivity $\sigma$) for a broad class of strongly coupled, four-dimensional charged relativistic gauge theory plasma with holographic gravitational duals containing higher-derivative corrections. The landscape of our holographic models captures non-conformal gauge theories with an arbitrary number of relevant coupling constants and a general scalar potential in the gravitational dual, allowing for a systematic exploration of charged transport along generic holographic RG flows. The leading-order higher-derivative corrections probe gauge theories with non-equal central charges $c\ne a$ at the ultraviolet fixed point, and enable the engineering of diverse temperature and charge density profiles for the viscosities and the conductivity. Our results establish the membrane paradigm in higher-derivative holographic models: all the transport coefficients are extracted from the black brane horizon values of the gravitational scalars, and various functions defining the gravitational holographic dual.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of 30.4 K and its Reemergence under Pressure in Fe1.11Se Synthesized via Ion-exchange and De-intercalation Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stoichiometry FeSe (s-FeSe) is a well-known parent of high-temperature unconventional superconductors owing to its charge-neutral layer, highly tunable structure and electronic properties, and rich interplays among multiple electronic phases. Yet the s-FeSe synthesized via high-temperature equilibrium reactions bears the notorious interstitial Fe,where merely 3% of them is sufficient to kill the superconductivity. Here, we successfully synthesized a new non-stoichiometric Fe1.11Se single crystal with a superconducting onset temperature (Tconset) of 30.4 K through a hydrothermal ion-exchange and de-intercalation route. 11% interstitial Fe ions exceed the equilibrium phase diagram limit. Intriguingly, under physical pressure, the Tconset of exhibits a "V"-shaped evolution with a minimum at 2-2.6 GPa, and then upturning into a second superconducting region, reminiscent of the behaviors in FeSe intercalates. Furthermore, a pressure-induced possible magnetic order, previously only observed in pressurized s-FeSe, shows up. These results offer fresh insights into the role of interstitial Fe in governing superconducting and transport properties under non-equilibrium synthesis and tuning strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a relaxation-based method to bound expectation values on the steady state of dissipative many-body quantum systems described by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of targeting to represent the entire state, we promote the reduced density matrices to our variables and enforce the constraints that are imposed on them by consistency with a global steady state. The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models for an arbitrary number of particles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and nonequilibrium sum rules in photodoped Hubbard ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using matrix product state techniques we study the nonequilibrium dynamical response of the half-filled Hubbard ladder when subject to an optical pump. Optical pumping offers a way of producing and manipulating new strongly correlated phenomena by suppressing existing magnetic correlations. The ladder allows the effects of pump directionality to be investigated, and compared to a single chain it has strong spin-charge coupling and a fully gapped excitation spectrum, promising different nonequilibrium physics. We compute time-dependent correlations, including the nonequilibrium dynamical structure factors for spin and charge. By deriving a combined spin-charge sum rule that applies both in and out-of-equilibrium, we show that spectral weight is pumped directly from the antiferromagnetic spin response into a low energy $\omega\sim 0$ charge response below the Mott gap. The transfer of weight is pump direction dependent: pumping directed along the legs disrupts magnetic correlations more than pumping in the rung direction, even if the post pump energy density is similar. The charge correlation length is dramatically enhanced by the pump, whilst the spin correlations are most strongly suppressed at nearest and next-nearest neighbour spacings. After the pump the system is in a nonthermal correlated metallic state, with gapless charge excitations and approximately equal spin and charge correlation lengths, emphasising the importance of treating these degrees of freedom on an equal footing in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Spurious Strange Correlators in Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>

Abstract: Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Focusing on 1D gapped bosonic/spin systems described by matrix product states (MPS), we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations (abbreviated as \emph{irrep}) in the eigenspace corresponding to the entanglment spectrum (entanglement space); (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states. By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions. Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal 1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Flat-band projected versus fully atomistic twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111, 205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state. Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable for characterizing MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement characterizing topological phase transitions in holographic nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological states of matter are characterized by nonlocal structures that are naturally encoded in the quantum entanglement of many-body wavefunctions. Topological semimetals are short-range entangled states at weak coupling and their entanglement structure at strong coupling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \to \infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems.</description>
