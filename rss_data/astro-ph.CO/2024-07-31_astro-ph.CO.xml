      <title>Probing beyond local-type non-Gaussianity with kSZ tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations may arise from a variety of well motivated early Universe scenarios. In particular, inflationary theories with additional light degrees of freedom can generate a bispectrum that is peaked in the squeezed limit. While the presence of an additional massless scalar can produce local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, in general the squeezed limit of the bispectrum depends on the mass of the new degree of freedom, and can deviate from the local shape. The resulting bispectrum leaves a distinct imprint on the amplitude and scale-dependence of the galaxy bias, which for massive fields can differ from the $k^{-2}$ scaling from local type non-Gaussianity, providing an observational window into the physics of the early Universe. In this work we demonstrate that kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich tomography with next generation cosmological surveys will offer significant additional constraining power for both the shape and amplitude of scale-dependent bias arising from primordial non-Gaussianity beyond the local type. We show that this improved constraining power is robust to various obstacles such as the optical depth degeneracy, photometric redshift errors, and uncertainty in the galaxy bias model. With CMB S4 and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, we forecast that compared to the galaxy survey alone the addition of kSZ tomography will offer a roughly factor of two reduction in the measurement uncertainty of the amplitude $f_{NL}$ of primordial non-Gaussianity well beyond the local (massless) limit. We find that kSZ tomography extends the range of masses for which order unity constraints on $f_{NL}$ are achievable, as well as extending the range of masses for which the late time probes of the matter power spectrum outperform the sensitivity of the CMB itself.</description>

      <title>A Generative Modeling Approach to Reconstructing 21-cm Tomographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of the cosmic 21-cm signal are hampered by astrophysical foregrounds that are far stronger than the signal itself. These foregrounds, typically confined to a wedge-shaped region in Fourier space, often necessitate the removal of a vast majority of modes, thereby degrading the quality of the data anisotropically. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep generative model based on stochastic interpolants to reconstruct the 21-cm data lost to wedge filtering. Our method leverages the non-Gaussian nature of the 21-cm signal to effectively map wedge-filtered 3D lightcones to samples from the conditional distribution of wedge-recovered lightcones. We demonstrate how our method is able to restore spatial information effectively, considering both varying cosmological initial conditions and astrophysics. Furthermore, we discuss a number of future avenues where this approach could be applied in analyses of the 21-cm signal, potentially offering new opportunities to improve our understanding of the Universe during the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionization.</description>

      <title>The MillenniumTNG Project: Impact of massive neutrinos on the cosmic large-scale structure and the distribution of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the cold dark matter plus massive neutrinos simulations of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, which aim to improve understanding of how well ongoing and future large-scale galaxy surveys will measure neutrino masses. Our largest simulations, $3000\,{\rm Mpc}$ on a side, use $10240^3$ particles of mass $m_{p} = 6.66\times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ to represent cold dark matter, and $2560^3$ to represent a population of neutrinos with summed mass $M_\nu = 100\,{\rm meV}$. Smaller volume runs with $\sim 630\,{\rm Mpc}$ also include cases with $M_\nu = 0\,\textrm{and}\, 300\,{\rm meV}$. All simulations are carried out twice using the paired-and-fixed technique for cosmic variance reduction. We evolve the neutrino component using the particle-based $\delta f$ importance sampling method, which greatly reduces shot noise in the neutrino density field. In addition, we modify the GADGET-4 code to account both for the influence of relativistic and mildly relativistic components on the expansion rate and for non-Newtonian effects on the largest represented simulation scales. This allows us to quantify accurately the impact of neutrinos on basic statistical measures of nonlinear structure formation, such as the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function. We use semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to predict the galaxy population and its clustering properties as a function of summed neutrino mass, finding significant ($\sim 10\%$) impacts on the cosmic star formation rate history, the galaxy mass function, and the clustering strength. This offers the prospect of identifying combinations of summary statistics that are optimally sensitive to the neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>MeerKLASS L-band deep-field intensity maps: entering the HI dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity maps, the final observations to be performed in L-band in the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) campaign. The observations represent the deepest single-dish HI intensity maps to date, produced from 41 repeated scans over $236\,{\rm deg}^2$, providing 62 hours of observational data for each of the 64 dishes before flagging. By introducing an iterative self-calibration process, the estimated thermal noise of the reconstructed maps is limited to ${\sim}\,1.21\,$mK ($1.2\,\times$ the theoretical noise level). This thermal noise will be sub-dominant relative to the HI fluctuations on large scales ($k\,{\lesssim}\,0.15\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$), which demands upgrades to power spectrum analysis techniques, particularly for covariance estimation. In this work, we present the improved MeerKLASS analysis pipeline, validating it on both a suite of mock simulations and a small sample of overlapping spectroscopic galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Despite only overlapping with ${\sim}\,25\%$ of the MeerKLASS deep field, and a conservative approach to covariance estimation, we still obtain a ${&gt;}\,4\,\sigma$ detection of the cross-power spectrum between the intensity maps and the 2269 galaxies at the narrow redshift range $0.39\,{&lt;}\,z\,{&lt;}\,0.46$. We briefly discuss the HI auto-power spectrum from this data, the detection of which will be the focus of follow-up work. For the first time with MeerKAT single-dish intensity maps, we also present evidence of HI emission from stacking the maps onto the positions of the GAMA galaxies.</description>

      <title>Properties of the diffuse gas component in filaments detected in the Dianoga cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are ideal laboratories where the evolution of the cosmic web can be studied. This allows for easier insight into the nature of the filaments. We investigate how the intrinsic properties of filaments are evolving in areas extracted from a larger cosmological simulation. We aim to identify significant trends in the properties of Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) and suggest possible explanations. To study the filaments and their contents, we select a subset of regions from the Dianoga simulation. We analysed these regions that were simulated with different baryon physics, namely with and without the AGN feedback. We construct the cosmic web using the Sub-space Constrained Mean Shift (SCMS) algorithm and the Sequential Chain Algorithm for Resolving Filaments (SCARF). We examined the basic physical properties of filaments (length, shape, mass, radius) and analysed different gas phases (hot, WHIM and colder gas components) within those structures. The evolution of the global filament properties and the properties of the gas phases were studied in the redshift range $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.48$. Within our simulations, the detected filaments have, on average, lengths below $9$ Mpc. The filaments' shape correlates with their length; the longer they are, the more likely they are curved. We find that the scaling relation between mass $M$ and length $L$ of the filaments is well described by the power law $M \propto L^{1.7}$. The radial density profile is widening with redshift, meaning that the radius of the filaments is getting larger over time. The fraction of gas mass in the WHIM phase does not depend on the model and is rising towards lower redshifts. However, the included baryon physics has a strong impact on the metallicity of gas in filaments, indicating that the AGN feedback impacts the metal content already at redshifts of $z \sim 2$.</description>

      <title>Bulk Black Hole Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension provides a mechanism to resolve the cosmological hierarchy problem and assembles a colosseum for dark matter contenders. In a series of recent publications we investigated whether primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. A key assumption of these investigations is that PBHs remain confined to the brane during the entire evaporation process. As a consequence, the abundance of PBHs evaporating at the present epoch is severely constrained by observations of both the extragalactic and Galactic $\gamma$-ray backgrounds. As a natural outgrowth of these investigations, herein we relax the assumption of brane localized PBHs and reexamine the evaporation process of PBHs which are allowed to escape into the dark dimension. We show that the escape of PBHs from the brane is almost instantaneous. Armed with this pivotal finding we reassess the allowed mass range of PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter, which is estimated to be $10^{11} \lesssim M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of the Millicharged Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that dark matter direct detection experiments are sensitive to the existence of particles with a small effective charge (for instance, via couplings to a kinetically mixed, low-mass dark photon). Our forecasts do not depend on these particles comprising a significant fraction of the dark matter. Rather, these experiments are sensitive to the irreducible abundance produced in the early universe through the freeze-in mechanism. We find that ongoing and proposed direct detection experiments will have world-leading sensitivity to effective charges $Q\sim 10^{-12}$ across nine orders of magnitude in mass, corresponding to a dark matter sub-fraction as low as $\sim 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>The Radio Galaxy Environment Reference Survey (RAGERS): a submillimetre study of the environments of massive radio-quiet galaxies at $z = 1{\rm -}3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the environments of massive galaxies at high redshift is crucial to understanding galaxy evolution and the conditions that gave rise to the distribution of matter we see in the Universe today. While high-$z$ radio galaxies (H$z$RGs) and quasars tend to reside in protocluster-like systems, the environments of their radio-quiet counterparts are relatively unexplored, particularly in the submillimetre, which traces dust-obscured star formation. In this study we search for 850 $\mu$m-selected submillimetre galaxies in the environments of massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), radio-quiet ($L_{500 {\rm MHz}} \lesssim 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) galaxies at $z \sim 1\text{--}3$ in COSMOS. By constructing number counts in circular regions of radius 1--6 arcmin and comparing with blank-field measurements, we find no significant overdensities of SMGs around massive radio-quiet galaxies at any of these scales, despite being sensitive down to overdensities of $\delta \sim 0.4$. To probe deeper than the catalogue we also examine the distribution of peaks in the SCUBA-2 SNR map, which reveals only tentative signs of any difference in the SMG densities of the radio-quiet galaxy environments compared to the blank field, and only on smaller scales (1$^{\prime}$ radii, corresponding to $\sim0.5$ Mpc) and higher SNR thresholds. We conclude that massive, radio-quiet galaxies at cosmic noon are typically in environments with $\delta\lesssim0.4$, which are either consistent with the blank field or contain only weak overdensities spanning sub-Mpc scales. The contrast between our results and studies of H$z$RGs with similar stellar masses and redshifts implies an intrinsic link between the wide-field environment and radio AGN luminosity at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Curvature-induced moduli stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss FLRW-cosmologies with negatively-curved spatial slices that induce a late-time stabilization of all the moduli of an effective field theory through Hubble friction, independently of the moduli-space curvature. This holds for pure moduli, which appear ubiquitously in string compactifications. Crucially, the cosmological solutions approach a Milne universe. Hence, the mechanism we describe in fact corresponds to late-time moduli stabilization in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Separating deterministic and stochastic gravitational wave signals in realistic pulsar timing array datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays indicate the presence of gravitational wave signals, likely from supermassive black hole binaries. These binaries can produce two types of signals: a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) or deterministic continuous gravitational waves (CGW). Correctly separating these signals is essential for accurate signal recovery and interpretation. This paper investigates the interaction between GWB and CGW signals within current analysis pipelines, focusing on misinterpretations and biases in parameter estimation when these signals are analyzed separately or together. We conducted several simulations based on the European PTA 24.8-year dataset. First, we injected either a GWB or a CGW. We compared parameter estimation using different search models, including Earth term only, combined Earth and pulsar term CGW templates, and correlated (HD) or uncorrelated (CURN) power law GWB templates. Our findings show that, when searched independently, the GWB and CGW signals can be misinterpreted as each other, and only a combined search can recover the true signal present. For datasets containing both a GWB and a CGW, failure to account for the CGW biases the recovery of the GWB. However, a combined search allows for the recovery of both GWB and CGW parameters without significant bias. Care must be taken with the method used to perform combined searches on these multi-component datasets, as the CGW pulsar term can be misinterpreted as a CURN. This can be avoided by direct searches for an HD correlated GWB plus a CGW. Our study underscores the importance of combined searches to ensure unbiased recovery of GWB parameters in the presence of strong CGWs, which is crucial for interpreting signals recently found in PTA data and represents a step toward a robust framework for disentangling stochastic and deterministic GW signals in future, more sensitive datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</description>

      <title>Finite distance effects on the Hellings-Downs curve in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in the overlap reduction function in pulsar timing array observations as a probe of modified gravity. However, current approximations to the Hellings-Downs curve for subluminal gravitational wave propagation, say $v&lt;1$, diverge at small angular pulsar separation. In this paper, we find that the ORF for the $v&lt;1$ case is sensitive to finite distance effects. First, we show that finite distance effects introduce an effective cut-off in the spherical harmonics decomposition at $\ell\sim \sqrt{1-v^2} \, kL$, where $\ell$ is the multipole number, $k$ the wavenumber of the gravitational wave and $L$ the distance to the pulsars. Then, we find that the overlap reduction function in the small angle limit approaches a value given by $\pi kL\,v^2\,(1-v^2)^2$ times a normalization factor, exactly matching the value for the autocorrelation recently derived. Although we focus on the $v&lt;1$ case, our formulation is valid for any value of $v$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the fundamental metallicity relation with observation and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity of galaxies is regulated by multiple astrophysical processes, which makes it a crucial diagnostic of galaxy formation and evolution. Beyond the fundamental mass-metallicity relation, a debate about the secondary galaxy property to predict the metallicity of galaxies arises. Motivated by this, we systematically examine the relationship between gas-phase metallicity and other galaxy properties, i.e. star formation rate (SFR) and galaxy size, in addition to stellar mass in both observation and simulation. We utilize the data from the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) survey and the TNG50 simulations. We find that the combination of $M_*/R_{\rm e}^\beta$ with $\beta\sim 0.6-1$ is in much stronger correlation to the metallicity than stellar mass alone, regardless of whether the SFR is included or not, in both observation and simulation. This indicates that galaxy size plays a more important role in determining gas-phase metallicity of galaxies than SFR. In addition, the TNG simulation predicts that the SFR, although being a subdominant role, becomes increasingly important in high-$z$ universe. Finally, we speculate that SFR modulates metallicity on the temporal dimension, synchronized with time-varying gas inflows, and galaxy size regulates metallicity on the spatial dimension by affecting the gravitational potential and the mass loading factor.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Fuzzy Dark Matter from Galaxy-Galaxy Strong-Lensing Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) has recently gained attention as a motivated candidate for the dark matter (DM) content of the Universe, as opposed to the commonly assumed cold DM (CDM), since the soliton profile intrinsic to FDM models was found to be particularly well suited to reproduce observed galaxy mass profiles. While FDM as a single DM component has been strongly constrained by multiple probes, there remained a mass window between $10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $10^{-24}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in which it can comprise a large portion ($\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10\%)$) of the total DM. In this work, we consider gravitational lensing measurements in the strong lensing regime, which are one of the only means to directly constrain the distribution and profile of DM in astronomical bodies. Using a simple model that combines a soliton FDM component with a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, we explore under what conditions DM halos with this hybrid profile are able to reproduce the observed Einstein radii of several known lenses. We find that FDM with a particle mass of $\lesssim 10^{-24}\,{\rm eV}$ cannot explain the observations if it makes up more than $\sim10\%$ of the total DM, effectively closing the lingering FDM mass window.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dark forces with measurements of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmology offers opportunities to test Dark Matter independently of its interactions with the Standard Model. We study the imprints of long-range forces acting solely in the dark sector on the distribution of galaxies, the so-called Large Scale Structure (LSS). We derive the strongest constraint on such forces from a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Along the way we consistently develop, for the first time, the Effective Field Theory of LSS in the presence of new dynamics in the dark sector. We forecast that future surveys will improve the current bound by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Constraining the emergent dark energy models with observational data at intermediate redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model and its generalized form, namely the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) model, which introduces a free parameter \unboldmath {\( \Delta \)} that can discriminate between the \unboldmath{$\mathrm{\Lambda}$}CDM model and the PEDE model. Fitting the emergent dark energy (EDE) models with the observational datasets including the cosmology-independent gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the observational Hubble data (OHD) at intermediate redshift, we find a large value of $H_0$ which is close to the results of local measurement of $H_0$ from the SH0ES Collaboration in both EDE models. In order to refine our analysis and tighten the constraints on cosmological parameters, we combine mid-redshift observations GRBs and OHD with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Finally, we constrain DE models by using the simultaneous fitting method, in which the parameters of DE models and the relation parameters of GRBs are fitted simultaneously. Our results suggest that PEDE and GEDE models can serve as an important supplement and be possible alternative to the standard cosmological model, pending further theoretical explorations and observational verifications.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can efficiently form black hole binaries in the early universe. We update the resulting constraints on PBH abundance using data from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. To capture a wide range of PBH scenarios, we consider a variety of mass functions, including critical collapse in the QCD epoch in the presence of non-Gaussianities. Applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis to a population binaries consisting of primordial and astrophysical black holes, we find that, in every scenario, the PBHs can make up at most $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ of dark matter in the mass range $1-200~M_\odot$. The shape and strength of the constraints are insensitive to the type of non-Gaussianities, the modifications to the mass function during the QCD epoch, or the modelling of the astrophysical PBH population.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian, post-Born, three-dimensional, on-the-fly ray tracing algorithm for gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analyses of the next generation cosmological surveys demand an accurate, efficient, and differentiable method for simulating the universe and its observables across cosmological volumes. We present Hamiltonian ray tracing (HRT) -- the first post-Born (accounting for lens-lens coupling and without relying on the Born approximation), three-dimensional (without assuming the thin-lens approximation), and on-the-fly (applicable to any structure formation simulations) ray tracing algorithm based on the Hamiltonian formalism. HRT performs symplectic integration of the photon geodesics in a weak gravitational field, and can integrate tightly with any gravity solver, enabling co-evolution of matter particles and light rays with minimal additional computations. We implement HRT in the particle-mesh library $\texttt{pmwd}$, leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs and automatic differentiation capabilities based on $\texttt{JAX}$. When tested on a point-mass lens, HRT achieves sub-percent accuracy in deflection angles above the resolution limit across both weak and moderately strong lensing regimes. We also test HRT in cosmological simulations on the convergence maps and their power spectra.</description>

      <title>Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS): 90 GHz Telescope Pointing, Beam Profile, Window Function, and Polarization Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a telescope array that observes the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over ~75% of the sky from the Atacama Desert, Chile, at frequency bands centered near 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. CLASS measures the large angular scale CMB polarization to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the optical depth to last scattering. This paper presents the optical characterization of the 90GHz telescope, which has been observing since July 2018. Observations of the Moon establish the pointing while dedicated observations of Jupiter are used for beam calibration. The standard deviations of the pointing error in azimuth, elevation, and boresight angle are 1.3, 2.1, and 2.0 arcminutes, respectively, over the first 3 years of observations. This corresponds to a pointing uncertainty ~7% of the beam's full width at half maximum (FWHM). The effective azimuthally-symmetrized instrument 1D beam estimated at 90 GHz has an FWHM of 0.620+/-0.003 deg and a solid angle of 138.7+/-0.6(stats.)+/-1.1(sys.) usr integrated to a radius of 4 deg. The corresponding beam window function drops to b_ell^2 = 0.93, 0.71, 0.14 at ell = 30, 100, 300, respectively. Far-sidelobes are studied using detector-centered intensity maps of the Moon and measured to be at a level of 10^-3 or below relative to the peak. The polarization angle of Tau A estimated from preliminary survey maps is 149.6+/-0.2(stats.) deg in equatorial coordinates. The instrumental temperature-to-polarization (T-to-P) leakage fraction, inferred from per-detector demodulated Jupiter scan data, has a monopole component at the level of 1.7 x 10^-3, a dipole component with an amplitude of 4.3 x 10^-3, with no evidence of quadrupolar leakage.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational-wave energy-density spectra from cosmological first-order phase transitions crucially depend on the terminal wall velocity of asymptotic bubble expansion when the driving force from the effective potential difference is gradually balanced by the backreaction force from the thermal plasma. Much attention has previously focused on the backreaction force acting on the bubble wall alone but overlooked the backreaction forces on the sound shell and shock-wave front, if any, which have been both numerically and analytically accomplished in our previous studies but only for a bag equation of state. In this paper, we will generalize the backreaction force on bubble expansion beyond the simple bag model.</description>

      <title>Impact of primordial black holes on the formation of the first stars and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BH) mergers and the stochastic GW background have triggered renewed interest in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the stellar-mass ($\sim 10 - 100\ \rm M_\odot$) and supermassive regimes ($\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}\ \rm M_\odot$). Although only a small fraction ($\lesssim 1\%$) of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs is required to explain such observations, these PBHs may play important roles in early structure/star/galaxy formation. In this chapter, we combine semi-analytical analysis and cosmological simulations to explore the possible impact of PBHs on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, taking into account two (competing) effects of PBHs: acceleration of structure formation and gas heating by BH accretion feedback. We find that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs (allowed by existing observational constraints) on primordial star formation is likely minor, although they do alter the properties of the first star-forming halos/clouds and can potentially trigger the formation of massive BHs, while supermassive PBHs serve as seeds of massive structures that can explain the apparent overabundance of massive galaxies in recent observations. Our tentative models and results call for future studies with improved modeling of the interactions between PBHs, particle DM, and baryons to better understand the impact of PBHs on early star/galaxy/structure formation and their imprints in high-redshift observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Sterile Neutrinogenesis: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production Independent of Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos ($\nu_s$s) are well-motivated and actively searched for hypothetical neutral particles that would mix with the Standard Model active neutrinos. They are considered prime warm dark matter (DM) candidates, typically when their mass is in the keV range, although they can also be hot or cold DM components. We discuss in detail the characteristics and phenomenology of $\nu_s$s that minimally couple only to active neutrinos and are produced in the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs), a process we called "PBH sterile neutrinogenesis". Contrary to the previously studied $\nu_s$ production mechanisms, this novel mechanism does not depend on the active-sterile mixing. The resulting $\nu_s$s have a distinctive spectrum and are produced with larger energies than in typical scenarios. This characteristic enables $\nu_s$s to be WDM in the unusual $0.3$ MeV to $0.3$ TeV mass range, if PBHs do not matter-dominate the Universe before evaporating. When PBHs matter-dominate before evaporating, the possible coincidence of induced gravitational waves associated with PBH evaporation and astrophysical X-ray observations from $\nu_s$ decays constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario. constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we would like to examine whether stable de Sitter inflationary solutions appear within power-law extensions of the Starobinsky model. In particular, we will address general constraints for the existence along with the stability of de Sitter inflationary solutions in a general case involving not only the Starobinsky $R^2$ term but also an additional power-law $R^n$ one. According to the obtained results, we will be able to identify which extension is more suitable for an early inflationary phase rather than a late-time cosmic acceleration phase. To be more specific, we will consider several values of $n$ to see whether the corresponding de Sitter inflationary solutions are stable or not.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects on the evaporation of PBHs: contributions to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Reviving Horndeski after GW170817 by Kaluza-Klein compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of Horndeski theory/ Galileons for late time cosmology is heavily constrained by the strict coincidence in the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves. These constraints presuppose that the minimally coupled photon is not modified, not even at the scales where General Relativity (GR) may need modification. We find that the 4D Galileon obtained from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of its higher dimensional version is a natural simultaneous modification of GR and electromagnetism with automatically "luminal" gravitational waves. This property follows without any fine tuning of Galileon potentials for a larger class of theories than previously thought. In particular, the $G_4$ potential is not constrained by the speed test and $G_5$ may also be present. In other words, some Galileon models that have been ruled out since the event GW170817 are, in fact, not necessarily constrained if they arise in 4D from compactifications of their higher dimensional Galileon counterparts. Besides their compelling luminality, the resulting vector Galileons are naturally $U(1)$ gauge invariant. We also argue that the Vainshtein screening that allows to recover GR predictions for solar system tests is also at work for electrodynamics in the dense region of laboratory tests.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>

Abstract: Dark photons coupling to $L_\mu-L_\tau$ lepton number difference are a highly studied light dark matter candidate, with potential to be discovered through their impact on terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. We re-examine this in the light of claimed tensions between the NO$\nu$A and T2K long baseline experiments, also taking into account data from the MINOS experiment. We obtain leading limits on the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge coupling $g'$ versus dark photon mass $m_{A'}$, and find no statistically significant alleviation of the tension from inclusion of the new physics effect.</description>

      <title>Are isolated compact galaxy groups special?</title>

Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But CGs have rarely been compared to regular groups, which are selected very differently. We study the global properties of a subsample of 80 groups of four members (CG4s), as well as their correlations, within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups, and compare them with those of the regular groups of Lim et al.. The latter are split into three control samples, complete in redshift and magnitude: one with the four brightest members, one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) with less than three magnitudes in range (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>
