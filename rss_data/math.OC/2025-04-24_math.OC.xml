      <title>CGD: Modifying the Loss Landscape by Gradient Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line-search methods are commonly used to solve optimization problems. A simplest line search method is steepest descent where one always moves in the direction of the negative gradient. Newton's method on the other hand is a second-order method that uses the curvature information in the Hessian to pick the descent direction. In this work, we propose a new line-search method called Constrained Gradient Descent (CGD) that implicitly changes the landscape of the objective function for efficient optimization. CGD is formulated as a solution to the constrained version of the original problem where the constraint is on a function of the gradient. We optimize the corresponding Lagrangian function thereby favourably changing the landscape of the objective function. This results in a line search procedure where the Lagrangian penalty acts as a control over the descent direction and can therefore be used to iterate over points that have smaller gradient values, compared to iterates of vanilla steepest descent. We establish global linear convergence rates for CGD and provide numerical experiments on synthetic test functions to illustrate the performance of CGD. We also provide two practical variants of CGD, CGD-FD which is a Hessian free variant and CGD-QN, a quasi-Newton variant and demonstrate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Problems in Optimization and Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give new results for problems in computational and statistical machine learning using tools from high-dimensional geometry and probability.
  We break up our treatment into two parts. In Part I, we focus on computational considerations in optimization. Specifically, we give new algorithms for approximating convex polytopes in a stream, sparsification and robust least squares regression, and dueling optimization.
  In Part II, we give new statistical guarantees for data science problems. In particular, we formulate a new model in which we analyze statistical properties of backdoor data poisoning attacks, and we study the robustness of graph clustering algorithms to ``helpful'' misspecification.</description>

      <title>Shape Alignment via Allen-Cahn Nonlinear-Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the impact of a phase field method on shape registration to align shapes of possibly different topology. It yields new insights into the building of discrepancy measures between shapes regardless of topology, which would have applications in fields of image data analysis such as computational anatomy. A soft end-point optimal control problem is introduced whose minimum measures the minimal control norm required to align an initial shape to a final shape, up to a small error term. The initial data is spatially integrable, the paths in control spaces are integrable and the evolution equation is a generalized convective Allen-Cahn. Binary images are used to represent shapes for the initial data. Inspired by level-set methods and large diffeomorphic deformation metric mapping, the controls spaces are integrable scalar functions to serve as a normal velocity and smooth reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to serve as velocity vector fields. The existence of mild solutions to the evolution equation is proved, the minimums of the time discretized optimal control problem are characterized, and numerical simulations of minimums to the fully discretized optimal control problem are displayed. The numerical implementation enforces the maximum-bounded principle, although it is not proved for these mild solutions. This research offers a novel discrepancy measure that provides valuable ways to analyze diverse image data sets. Future work involves proving the existence of minimums, existence and uniqueness of strong solutions and the maximum bounded principle.</description>

      <title>Eigendecomposition Parameterization of Penalty Matrices for Enhanced Control Design: Aerospace Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern control algorithms require tuning of square weight/penalty matrices appearing in quadratic functions/costs to improve performance and/or stability output. Due to simplicity in gain-tuning and enforcing positive-definiteness, diagonal penalty matrices are used extensively in control methods such as linear quadratic regulator (LQR), model predictive control, and Lyapunov-based control. In this paper, we propose an eigendecomposition approach to parameterize penalty matrices, allowing positive-definiteness with non-zero off-diagonal entries to be implicitly satisfied, which not only offers notable computational and implementation advantages, but broadens the class of achievable controls. We solve three control problems: 1) a variation of Zermelo's navigation problem, 2) minimum-energy spacecraft attitude control using both LQR and Lyapunov-based methods, and 3) minimum-fuel and minimum-time Lyapunov-based low-thrust trajectory design. Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the decision variables, which will parameterize the penalty matrices. The results demonstrate improvements of up to 65% in the performance objective in the example problems utilizing the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Rank-one convexification for quadratic optimization problems with step function penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate convexification for convex quadratic optimization with step function penalties. Such problems can be cast as mixed-integer quadratic optimization problems, where binary variables are used to encode the non-convex step function. First, we derive the convex hull for the epigraph of a quadratic function defined by a rank-one matrix and step function penalties. Using this rank-one convexification, we develop copositive and semi-definite relaxations for general convex quadratic functions. Leveraging these findings, we construct convex formulations to the support vector machine problem with 0--1 loss and show that they yield robust estimators in settings with anomalies and outliers.</description>

      <title>The Safety-Privacy Tradeoff in Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a collection of linear stochastic bandit problems, each modeling the random response of different agents to proposed interventions, coupled together by a global safety constraint. We assume a central coordinator must choose actions to play on each bandit with the objective of regret minimization, while also ensuring that the expected response of all agents satisfies the global safety constraints at each round, in spite of uncertainty about the bandits' parameters. The agents consider their observed responses to be private and in order to protect their sensitive information, the data sharing with the central coordinator is performed under local differential privacy (LDP). However, providing higher level of privacy to different agents would have consequences in terms of safety and regret. We formalize these tradeoffs by building on the notion of the sharpness of the safety set - a measure of how the geometric properties of the safe set affects the growth of regret - and propose a unilaterally unimprovable vector of privacy levels for different agents given a maximum regret budget.</description>

      <title>Generalized vector equilibrium problems with pairs of bifunctions and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the following generalized vector equilibrium problem: Let $X, Y$ be topological vector spaces over reals, $D$ be a nonempty subset of $X$, $K$ be a nonempty set and $\theta$ be origin of $Y$. Given multi-valued mapping $F: D\times K\rightrightarrows Y$, can be formulated as the problem, find $\bar x\in D$ such that $$\mbox{GVEP}(F, D, K)\,\,\,\,\,\,\theta\in F(\bar x, y)\ \mbox{for all}\ y\in K.$$ We prove several existence theorems for solutions to the generalized vector equilibrium problem when $K$ is an arbitrary nonempty set without any algebraic or topological structure. Furthermore, we establish that some sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of a solution for the considered conditions are imposed not on the entire domain of the bifunctions but rather on a self-segment-dense subset. We apply the obtained results to variational relation problems, vector equilibrium problems, and common fixed point problems.</description>

      <title>Modern Computational Methods in Reinsurance Optimization: From Simulated Annealing to Quantum Branch &amp; Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement modern computational methods to enhance catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts in practice. The underlying optimization problem involves attachment points, limits, and reinstatement clauses, and the objective is to maximize the expected profit while considering risk measures and regulatory constraints. We study the problem formulation, paving the way for practitioners, for two very different approaches: A local search optimizer using simulated annealing, which handles realistic constraints, and a branch &amp; bound approach exploring the potential of a future speedup via quantum branch &amp; bound. On the one hand, local search effectively generates contract structures within several constraints, proving useful for complex treaties that have multiple local optima. On the other hand, although our branch &amp; bound formulation only confirms that solving the full problem with a future quantum computer would require a stronger, less expensive bound and substantial hardware improvements, we believe that the designed application-specific bound is sufficiently strong to serve as a basis for further works. Concisely, we provide insurance practitioners with a robust numerical framework for contract optimization that handles realistic constraints today, as well as an outlook and initial steps towards an approach which could leverage quantum computers in the future.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Regret Benchmarks in Online Non-Stochastic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the online non-stochastic control problem, an agent sequentially selects control inputs for a linear dynamical system when facing unknown and adversarially selected convex costs and disturbances. A common metric for evaluating control policies in this setting is policy regret, defined relative to the best-in-hindsight linear feedback controller. However, for general convex costs, this benchmark may be less meaningful since linear controllers can be highly suboptimal. To address this, we introduce an alternative, more suitable benchmark--the performance of the best fixed input. We show that this benchmark can be viewed as a natural extension of the standard benchmark used in online convex optimization and propose a novel online control algorithm that achieves sublinear regret with respect to this new benchmark. We also discuss the connections between our method and the original one proposed by Agarwal et al. in their seminal work introducing the online non-stochastic control problem, and compare the performance of both approaches through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gradient Descent on Riemannian Manifolds with Nonnegative Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an adaptive gradient descent method for geodesically convex optimization on a Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature. The method automatically adapts to the local geometry of the function and does not use additional expensive computations other than calculation of the derivative of the Riemannian exponential. We prove the convergence of the method under the assumption of geodesic completeness. The performance of the method is illustrated by experiments on the sphere, the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices equipped with the Bures-Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>Robust Accelerated Dynamics for Subnetwork Bilinear Zero-Sum Games with Distributed Restarting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate distributed Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of two-subnetwork zero-sum games characterized by bilinear coupling. We present a distributed primal-dual accelerated mirror-descent algorithm that guarantees convergence. However, we demonstrate that this time-varying algorithm is not robust, as it fails to converge under even the slightest disturbances. To address this limitation, we introduce a distributed accelerated algorithm that employs a coordinated restarting mechanism. We model this new algorithm as a hybrid dynamical system and establish that it possesses structural robustness.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Update Method for Exponential Family Projection Filters with Non-Conjugate Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projection filter is one of the approximations to the solution of the optimal filtering problem. It approximates the filtering density by projecting the dynamics of the square-root filtering density onto the tangent space of the square-root parametric densities manifold. While the projection filters for exponential and mixture families with continuous measurement processes have been well studied, the continuous-discrete projection filtering algorithm for non-conjugate priors has received less attention.
  In this paper, we introduce a simple Riemannian optimization method to be used for the Bayesian update step in the continuous-discrete projection filter for exponential families. Specifically, we show that the Bayesian update can be formulated as an optimization problem of $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergence, where the corresponding Riemannian gradient can be easily computed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method via two highly non-Gaussian Bayesian update problems.</description>

      <title>New Primal-Dual Algorithm for Convex Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primal-dual algorithm (PDA) is a classic and popular scheme for convex-concave saddle point problems. It is universally acknowledged that the proximal terms in the subproblems about the primal and dual variables are crucial to the convergence theory and numerical performance of primal-dual algorithms. By taking advantage of the information from the current and previous iterative points, we exploit two new proximal terms for the subproblems about the primal and dual variables. Based on two new proximal terms, we present a new primal-dual algorithm for convex-concave saddle point problems with bilinear coupling terms and establish its global convergence and O(1/N ) ergodic convergence rate. When either the primal function or the dual function is strongly convex, we accelerate the above proposed algorithm and show that the corresponding algorithm can achieve O(1/N^2) convergence rate. Since the conditions for the stepsizes of the proposed algorithm are related directly to the spectral norm of the linear transform, which is difficult to obtain in some applications, we also introduce a linesearch strategy for the above proposed primal-dual algorithm and establish its global convergence and O(1/N ) ergodic convergence rate . Some numerical experiments are conducted on matrix game and LASSO problems by comparing with other state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed three primal-dual algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pose the Kantorovich optimal transport problem as a min-max problem with a Nash equilibrium that can be obtained dynamically via a two-player game, providing a framework for approximating optimal couplings. We prove convergence of the timescale-separated gradient descent dynamics to the optimal transport plan, and implement the gradient descent algorithm with a particle method, where the marginal constraints are enforced weakly using the KL divergence, automatically selecting a dynamical adaptation of the regularizer. The numerical results highlight the different advantages of using the standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence versus the reverse KL divergence with this approach, opening the door for new methodologies.</description>

      <title>Linear convergence of a one-cut conditional gradient method for total variation regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fully-corrective generalized conditional gradient method for convex minimization problems involving total variation regularization on multidimensional domains. It relies on alternating between updating an active set of subsets of the spatial domain as well as of an iterate given by a conic combination of the associated characteristic functions. Different to previous approaches in the same spirit, the computation of a new candidate set only requires the solution of one prescribed mean curvature problem instead of the resolution of a fractional minimization task analogous to finding a generalized Cheeger set. After discretization, the former can be realized by a single run of a graph cut algorithm leading to significant speedup in practice. We prove the global sublinear convergence of the resulting method, under mild assumptions, and its asymptotic linear convergence in a more restrictive two-dimensional setting which uses results of stability of surfaces of prescribed curvature under perturbations of the curvature. Finally, we numerically demonstrate this convergence behavior in some model PDE-constrained minimization problems.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium Learning In Large Populations With First Order Payoff Modifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Nash equilibrium learning -- convergence of the population state to a suitably defined Nash equilibria set -- for a class of payoff dynamical mechanism with a first order modification. The first order payoff modification can model aspects of the agents' bounded rationality, anticipatory or averaging terms in the payoff mechanism, or first order Pad\'e approximations of delays. To obtain our main results, we apply a combination of two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective optimization for scattering mitigation and scattering screen reconstruction in VLBI observations of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse problem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which is obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the one-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the scattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the Galactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its effect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization landscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen affecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a wide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230 GHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz. Our analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in imaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in weakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The successful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event horizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the study of the scattering screen itself.</description>

      <title>Scalable Data-Driven Basis Selection for Linear Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide an effective approach for accurately and efficiently modeling atomic interactions, expanding the capabilities of atomistic simulations to complex systems. However, a priori feature selection leads to high complexity, which can be detrimental to both computational cost and generalization, resulting in a need for hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the benefits of active set algorithms for automated data-driven feature selection. The proposed methods are implemented within the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. Computational tests conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets indicate that sparse ACE models consistently enhance computational efficiency, generalization accuracy and interpretability over dense ACE models. An added benefit of the proposed algorithms is that they produce entire paths of models with varying cost/accuracy ratio.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization with Efficient Communication, Event-Triggered Solution Enhancement, and Operation Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern large-scale systems with sensor networks and IoT devices it is essential to collaboratively solve complex problems while utilizing network resources efficiently. In our paper we present three distributed optimization algorithms that exhibit efficient communication among nodes. Our first algorithm presents a simple quantized averaged gradient procedure for distributed optimization, which is shown to converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Our second algorithm incorporates a novel event-triggered refinement mechanism, which refines the utilized quantization level to enhance the precision of the estimated optimal solution. It enables nodes to terminate their operation according to predefined performance guarantees. Our third algorithm is tailored to operate in environments where each message consists of only a few bits. It incorporates a novel event-triggered mechanism for adjusting the quantizer basis and quantization level, allowing nodes to collaboratively decide operation termination based on predefined performance criteria. We analyze the three algorithms and establish their linear convergence. Finally, an application on distributed sensor fusion for target localization is used to demonstrate their favorable performance compared to existing algorithms in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hitting and Covering Affine Families of Convex Polyhedra, with Applications to Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric hitting set problems, in which we seek a smallest set of points that collectively hit a given set of ranges, are ubiquitous in computational geometry. Most often, the set is discrete and is given explicitly. We propose new variants of these problems, dealing with continuous families of convex polyhedra, and show that they capture decision versions of the two-level finite adaptability problem in robust optimization. We show that these problems can be solved in strongly polynomial time when the size of the hitting/covering set and the dimension of the polyhedra and the parameter space are constant. We also show that the hitting set problem can be solved in strongly quadratic time for one-parameter families of convex polyhedra in constant dimension. This leads to new tractability results for finite adaptability that are the first ones with so-called left-hand-side uncertainty, where the underlying problem is non-linear.</description>

      <title>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</description>

      <title>On the Bredies-Chenchene-Lorenz-Naldi algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monotone inclusion problems occur in many areas of optimization and variational analysis. Splitting methods, which utilize resolvents or proximal mappings of the underlying operators, are often applied to solve these problems. In 2022, Bredies, Chenchene, Lorenz, and Naldi introduced a new elegant algorithmic framework that encompasses various well known algorithms including Douglas-Rachford and Chambolle-Pock. They obtained powerful weak and strong convergence results, where the latter type relies on additional strong monotonicity assumptions. In this paper, we complement the analysis by Bredies et al. by relating the projections of the fixed point sets of the underlying operators that generate the (reduced and original) preconditioned proximal point sequences. We also obtain strong convergence results in the case of linear relations. Various examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>Drift Control with Discretionary Stopping for a Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic control with discretionary stopping for the drift of a diffusion process over an infinite time horizon. The objective is to choose a control process and a stopping time to minimize the expectation of a convex terminal cost in the presence of a fixed operating cost and a control-dependent running cost per unit of elapsed time. Under appropriate conditions on the coefficients of the controlled diffusion, an optimal pair of control and stopping rules is shown to exist. Moreover, under the same assumptions, it is shown that the optimal control is a constant which can be computed fairly explicitly; and that it is optimal to stop the first time an appropriate interval is visited. We consider also a constrained version of the above problem, in which an upper bound on the expectation of available stopping times is imposed; we show that this constrained problem can be reduced to an unconstrained problem with some appropriate change of parameters and, as a result, solved by similar arguments.</description>

      <title>Approximate solution of stochastic infinite horizon optimal control problems for constrained linear uncertain systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a single-step prediction horizon to approximate the solution of infinite horizon optimal control problems with the expected sum of convex stage costs for constrained linear uncertain systems. The proposed method aims to enhance a given sub-optimal controller, leveraging data to achieve a nearly optimal solution for the infinite horizon problem. The method is built on two techniques. First, we estimate the expected values of the convex costs using a computationally tractable approximation, achieved by sampling across the space of disturbances. Second, we implement a data-driven approach to approximate the optimal value function and its corresponding domain, through systematic exploration of the system's state space. These estimates are subsequently used to calculate the terminal cost and terminal set within the proposed MPC. We prove recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence in probability to the target set. Furthermore, we prove that the estimated value function converges to the optimal value function in a local region. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is illustrated with detailed numerical simulations and comparisons with a value iteration method and a Learning MPC that minimizes a certainty equivalent cost.</description>

      <title>Neural Risk Limiting Dispatch in Power Networks: Formulation and Generalization Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk limiting dispatch (RLD) has been proposed as an approach that effectively trades off economic costs with operational risks for power dispatch under uncertainty. However, how to solve the RLD problem with provably near-optimal performance still remains an open problem. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this challenge. We first design a data-driven formulation for the RLD problem, which aims to construct a decision rule that directly maps day-ahead observable information to cost-effective dispatch decisions for the future delivery interval. Unlike most existing works that follow a predict-then-optimize paradigm, this end-to-end rule bypasses the additional suboptimality introduced by separately handling prediction and optimization. We then propose neural RLD, a novel solution method to the data-driven formulation. This method leverages an L2-regularized neural network to learn the decision rule, thereby transforming the data-driven formulation into a neural network training task that can be efficiently completed by stochastic gradient descent. A theoretical performance guarantee is further established to bound the suboptimality of our method, which implies that its suboptimality approaches zero with high probability as more samples are utilized. Simulation tests across various systems demonstrate our method's superior performance in convergence, suboptimality, and computational efficiency compared with benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Commutation principles for nonsmooth variational problems on Euclidean Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The commutation principle proved by Ram\'irez, Seeger, and Sossa (SIAM J Optim 23:687-694, 2013) in the setting of Euclidean Jordan algebras says that for a Fr\'echet differentiable function $\Theta$ and a spectral function $F$, any local minimizer or maximizer $a$ of $\Theta+F$ over a spectral set $\mathcal{E}$ operator commutes with the gradient of $\Theta$ at $a$. In this paper, we improve this commutation principle by allowing $\Theta$ to be nonsmooth with mild regularity assumptions over it. For example, for the case of local minimizer, we show that $a$ operator commutes with some element of the limiting (Mordukhovich) subdifferential of $\Theta$ at $a$ provided that $\Theta$ is subdifferentially regular at $a$ satisfying a qualification condition. For the case of local maximizer, we prove that $a$ operator commutes with each element of the (Fenchel) subdifferential of $\Theta$ at $a$ whenever this subdifferential is nonempty. As an application, we characterize the local optimizers of shifted strictly convex spectral functions and norms over automorphism invariant sets.</description>

      <title>Certifying solutions of degenerate semidefinite programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the exact method failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10959v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the convergence of the Policy Iteration Algorithm (PIA) for a class of general continuous-time entropy-regularized stochastic control problems. In particular, instead of employing sophisticated PDE estimates for the iterative PDEs involved in the algorithm (see, e.g., Huang-Wang-Zhou(2025)), we shall provide a simple proof from scratch for the convergence of the PIA. Our approach builds on probabilistic representation formulae for solutions of PDEs and their derivatives. Moreover, in the finite horizon model and in the infinite horizon model with large discount factor, the similar arguments lead to a super-exponential rate of convergence without tear. Finally, with some extra efforts we show that our approach can be extended to the diffusion control case in the one dimensional setting, also with a super-exponential rate of convergence.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling-based gradient method for dimension reduction in Poisson log-normal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00476v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional count data poses significant challenges for statistical analysis, necessitating effective methods that also preserve explainability. We focus on a low rank constrained variant of the Poisson log-normal model, which relates the observed data to a latent low-dimensional multivariate Gaussian variable via a Poisson distribution. Variational inference methods have become a golden standard solution to infer such a model. While computationally efficient, they usually lack theoretical statistical properties with respect to the model. To address this issue we propose a projected stochastic gradient scheme that directly maximizes the log-likelihood. We prove the convergence of the proposed method when using importance sampling for estimating the gradient. Specifically, we obtain a rate of convergence of $O(T^{-1/2} + N^{-1})$ with $T$ the number of iterations and $N$ the number of Monte Carlo draws. The latter follows from a novel descent lemma for non convex $L$-smooth objective functions, and random biased gradient estimate. We also demonstrate numerically the efficiency of our solution compared to its variational competitor. Our method not only scales with respect to the number of observed samples but also provides access to the desirable properties of the maximum likelihood estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with the output consensus problem for multiagent systems over balanced digraphs by passivity analysis. As the standard diffusive coupling structure only models the undirected interconnection, we propose a general approach capable of processing directed coupling and performing passivity analysis. To mitigate the complexity arising from the nonlinearity and directed interconnections, we reformulate the output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. We provide passivity analysis and establish a sufficient condition based on passivity for achieving output agreement in multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the mixed (continuous/discrete) network design problems, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining toll charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to an approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.</description>

      <title>Indirect Adaptive Control Using a Static Update Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The update law in the indirect adaptive control scheme can be extended to include feedthrough of an error term. This reduces undesired oscillations of the calculated weights. When the ${\sigma}$-modification is used for achieving robustness against unstructured uncertainties, the gain of the feedthrough in the update law cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Compared to our previous result, we show stability of the closed loop for a larger parameter-range for the gain of the feedthrough in the update law. This parameter-range includes a configuration for which the influence of the integration in the update law diminishes over time, i.e. for which the adaptation for large times is governed solely by the feedthrough in the update law. By initializing at zero, this allows for removing the integration from the update law, resulting in a static update law. For the purely linear case, the adaptation acts like a disturbance observer. Frequency-domain analysis of the closed loop with a second order plant shows that removing the integration from the update law with ${\sigma}$-modification and feedthrough affects how precisely disturbances in the low-frequency band are observed. If the damping injected into the adaptation process by the ${\sigma}$-modification exceeds certain bounds, then the precision is increased by using the static update law.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-concave optimization of the first eigenvalue of elliptic operators with application to topology optimization by homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optimization problems of the first eigenvalue of elliptic operators with applications to two-phase optimal design problems (also known as topology optimization problems) of conductivity and elasticity relaxed by homogenization. Under certain assumptions, we show that the first eigenvalue is a pseudo-concave function. Due to pseudo-concavity, every stationary point is a global maximizer, and there exists a global minimizer that is an extreme point (corresponding to a 0-1 solution in optimal design problems). We perform simple numerical experiments on optimal design problems to demonstrate that global optimal solutions or 0-1 solutions can be obtained by a simple gradient method.</description>

      <title>The Price of Simplicity: Analyzing Decoupled Policies for Multi-Location Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the performance cost of using simple, decoupled control policies in inherently coupled systems? Motivated by industrial refrigeration systems, where centralized compressors exhibit economies of scale yet traditional control employs decoupled room-by-room temperature regulation, we address this question through the lens of multi-location inventory control. Here, a planner manages multiple inventories to meet stochastic demand while minimizing costs that are coupled through nonlinear ordering functions reflecting economies of scale. Our main contributions are: (i) a surprising equivalence result showing that optimal stationary base-stock levels for individual locations remain unchanged despite the coupling when restricting attention to decoupled strategies; (ii) tight performance bounds for simple decoupled policies relative to optimal coupled policies, revealing that the worst-case ratio depends primarily on the degree of nonlinearity in the cost function and scales with the number of locations for systems with fixed costs; and (iii) analysis of practical online algorithms that achieve competitive performance without solving complex dynamic programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that while decoupled policies significantly outperform their worst-case guarantees in typical scenarios, they still exhibit meaningful suboptimality compared to fully coordinated strategies. These results provide actionable guidance for system operators navigating the trade-off between control complexity and operational efficiency in coupled systems.</description>

      <title>An efficient primal dual semismooth Newton method for semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient semismooth Newton method, named SSNCP, for solving a class of semidefinite programming problems. Our approach is rooted in an equivalent semismooth system derived from the saddle point problem induced by the augmented Lagrangian duality. An additional correction step is incorporated after the semismooth Newton step to ensure that the iterates eventually reside on a manifold where the semismooth system is locally smooth. Global convergence is achieved by carefully designing inexact criteria and leveraging the $\alpha$-averaged property to analyze the error. The correction steps address challenges related to the lack of smoothness in local convergence analysis. Leveraging the smoothness established by the correction steps and assuming a local error bound condition, we establish the local superlinear convergence rate without requiring the stringent assumptions of nonsingularity or strict complementarity. Furthermore, we prove that SSNCP converges to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3/2})$. Numerical experiments on various datasets, especially the Mittelmann benchmark, demonstrate the high efficiency and robustness of SSNCP compared to state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>

      <title>The deep multi-FBSDE method: a robust deep learning method for coupled FBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the deep multi-FBSDE method for robust approximation of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), focusing on cases where the deep BSDE method of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) fails to converge. To overcome the convergence issues, we consider a family of FBSDEs that are equivalent to the original problem in the sense that they satisfy the same associated partial differential equation (PDE). Our algorithm proceeds in two phases: first, we approximate the initial condition for the FBSDE family, and second, we approximate the original FBSDE using the initial condition approximated in the first phase. Numerical experiments show that our method converges even when the standard deep BSDE method does not.</description>

      <title>Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</description>
