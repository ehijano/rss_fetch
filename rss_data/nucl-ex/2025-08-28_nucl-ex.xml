      <title>Direct measurement of the 103Rh(n,gamma) and 103Rh(gamma,n) cross section up to stellar temperatures at the CSNS Back-n and SSRF SLEGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross sections of 103Rh(n,gamma) and 103Rh(gamma,n) play a crucial role in the stellar nucleosynthesis, rhodium-based self-powered neutron detectors, and nuclear medicine. The cross sections of 103Rh(n,gamma) was measured by the time-of-flight(TOF) method from 1 eV to 1000 keV at the Back-n facility of the Chinese Spallation Neutron Source. In the resolved resonance region, the data reported multiple new resonance structures for the first time. And some discrepancies were observed, offering valuable insights into the differences between the evaluated libraries. Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACSs) were calculated within the temperature range of the s process nucleosynthesis model, based on the averaged cross sections in the unresolved resonance region. Meanwhile the cross sections of 103Rh(gamma,n) within the range of p process nucleosynthesis were measured using laser Compton scattering (LCS) gamma rays and a new neutron flat efficiency detector (FED) array at the Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source (SLEGS), Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Using an unfolding iteration method, 103Rh(gamma,n) data were obtained with uncertainty less than 5%, and the inconsistencies between the available experimental data and the evaluated libraries were discussed. This study provides a reliable benchmark for nuclear data evaluation and model optimization, and lays a solid foundation for Rh medical isotope applications and astrophysical research.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the differential and total cross-sections of $\gamma$-ray emission induced by $14.1$ MeV neutrons for C, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe using the tagged neutron method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, differential cross sections of $\gamma$-ray emission produced in nuclear reactions induced by $14.1$~MeV neutrons are measured for the $4.439$~MeV line from carbon, as well as for $10$ individual $\gamma$-ray lines from aluminum, $6$ from silicon, $8$ from calcium, $16$ from titanium, $6$ from chromium, and $14$ from iron. The measurements were conducted using the tagged neutron method with four LaBr$_3$(Ce) scintillation detectors positioned at angles of $25^{\circ}$, $45^{\circ}$, $60^{\circ}$, and $70^{\circ}$ relative to the generator target -- sample center axis. A neutron generator capable of producing $16$ separate beams of tagged neutrons was employed, which, combined with the detector system, enabled the determination of differential cross-sections for $64$ distinct angle values in the range of $17^{\circ}$ to $89^{\circ}$. To simplify data visualization, the angular distributions were divided into $5^{\circ}$ intervals, with weighted mean values of the angle and differential cross-section calculated for each interval. Corrections for multiple neutron scattering and attenuation, $\gamma$-ray attenuation, and total detection efficiency, computed using GEANT4, were accounted for in the cross-section calculations. Additional measurements were performed to validate the correction calculations. The total $\gamma$-ray emission cross-sections were obtained by approximating the angular distributions with even-order Legendre polynomial expansions up to the $6$th degree, followed by integration over the full solid angle. The total systematic error for the obtained data was estimated as $9$\,\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the authors present a simplified method for determining proton pressure, based on concepts from statistical mechanics, quantum chromodynamics - specifically asymptotic freedom of quarks - and other well-established physical concepts. The result obtained for the proton pressure was $0.3570\times10^{35}$ Pa, which is consistent with recently reported experimental data.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume analysis and universal scaling signatures near the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantifying the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in QCD through numerical calculations on a discrete space-time lattice, one needs to perform controlled extrapolations to the continuum and infinite-volume limits followed by an extrapolation to the limit of massless light quarks. We discuss here, the results on the latter two limits at still finite lattice spacings. We use here for chiral symmetry breaking, an improved order parameter free of additive and multiplicative divergences and we analyse its volume and quark mass dependence. Comparing to the expected universal behavior in the chiral limit, we quantify deviations from the universal finite-size scaling behavior as function of the light to strange quark mass ratio.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Pair Energy Correlators: From Profiling Partonic Splittings to Probing Heavy-Flavor Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce heavy-flavor energy correlators, $\langle \Psi |\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{H}}(\vec{n}_1) \mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{H}}(\vec{n}_2)|\Psi \rangle$, as a powerful observable for profiling partonic splittings and characterizing heavy-flavor fragmentation. We present its collinear factorization, perform resummation, and demonstrate the angular distribution's sensitivity to both the heavy-quark pair splitting and their subsequent fragmentation. We then apply the heavy-flavor EEC to probe medium-induced effects, revealing its sensitivity to medium modifications to heavy-quark pair splitting functions and to the medium's spatial structure.</description>

      <title>Charting the Luminosity Capabilities of the CERN Large Hadron Collider with Various Nuclear Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been instrumental in recent advances in experimental high energy physics by colliding beams of protons and heavier nuclei at unprecedented energies. The present heavy-ion programme is based mainly on colliding lead nuclei. For future ion runs, there is strong interest to achieve a significantly higher integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity, which might be achieved through collisions of species other than Pb. In this paper, we explore the nucleon-nucleon luminosity projections in the LHC for a selection of ion species ranging from He to Xe, and including Pb as reference. Alternative beam production schemes are investigated as a way to mitigate effects such as space charge that degrade the beam quality in the LHC injectors. In the most optimistic scenarios, we find up to about a factor~4 improvement in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity for a typical future one-month run, with respect to the present Pb programme. We also outline a future study programme and experiments to test the assumptions and refine the simulated projections put forward in this article.</description>

      <title>A comparison study of collisions at relativistic energies involving light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive comparisons of $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and $^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=68.5$ GeV as well as $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=68.5$ GeV based on a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. We recommend measuring the ratio of the elliptic flow to the triangular flow, which shows appreciable sensitivity to the structure of light nuclei as also found in other studies. This is especially so if the observable is measured near the target rapidity in $^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O or $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne collisions, as originally found in the present study. Our study serves as a useful reference for understanding the structure effect on observables in collisions involving light nuclei under analysis or on the schedule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exclusive production of a vector-toponium $\psi_t$ state by photon-hadron interactions is investigated considering proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) energies. The scattering amplitude is calculated using the $k_T$-factorization formalism assuming that the vector-toponium state can be described by a Gaussian light-cone wave function and considering different models for the unintegrated gluon distribution. Predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross-sections are presented.</description>

      <title>Measurement of radionuclide production probabilities in negative muon nuclear capture and validation of Monte Carlo simulation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the development of a sample radioactivity calculation program, we have measured radionuclide production probabilities in negative muon nuclear capture to update experimental data and to validate a calculation dataset obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation code. The probabilities have been obtained by an activation experiment on $^{27}$Al, $^\mathrm{nat}$Si, $^{59}$Co, and $^\mathrm{nat}$Ta targets. The obtained probabilities expand the validation scope to the radionuclide production processes outside of the existing data coverage. By comparing the resultant probabilities with the calculated dataset, it has been revealed that the dataset is generally on the {\color{black}safe} side in radioactivity estimation and needs to be corrected in the following three cases: (i) isomer production; (ii) radionuclide production by the multiple neutron emission; (iii) radionuclide production by particle emissions involving a proton. The present probabilities and the new findings on the correction provide valuable clues to improvements of the simulation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of the factorization of the double nuclear modification factor in relativistic heavy ion collisions is tested for different types of final-state hadrons within the HYDJET++ model. The results demonstrate that this factorization holds reasonably well at moderately high transverse momenta, provided that the effects of double parton scattering can be small or neglected.</description>

      <title>Classification of Hoyle State Decay Branches in Active Target Time Projection Chamber using Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-class convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been developed using Keras deep learning library in Python for image-based classification of $^{12}$C Hoyle state decay branches from tracking information, recorded by Saha Active Target Time Projection Chamber, SAT-TPC (currently under development). The nuclear events, produced by the 30 MeV $\alpha$-particle beam in the SAT-TPC, filled with Ar + CO$_2$ (90:10) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure, have been considered for training and validation of the models. The elastic scattering and Hoyle state sequential and direct decay events in the interaction of $\alpha$-particle with $^{40}$Ar, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O nuclei have been generated through Monte-Carlo simulation. The three-dimensional tracks, produced by the scattering and decay products through primary ionization of gaseous medium, have been simulated with Geant4. The primary tracks, distributed on the beam-plane, have been convoluted with electron diffusion, obtained with Magboltz, to produce the final tracking information. The classification performance of the proposed model for different readout segmentation schemes of the SAT-TPC has been discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the Linewidth of the 12.4-keV Solid-State $^{45}$Sc Isomeric Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</description>
