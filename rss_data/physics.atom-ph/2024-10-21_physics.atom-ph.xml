      <title>Attosecond vortices in semiconductor materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical results on the generation of short-wavelength attosecond vortex beams in semiconductors through their interactions with an intense Laguerre-Gauss beam, in the limit where non-perturbative high-order harmonics are generated. We exploit the details of the novel microscopic mechanism for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in condensed matter, such as the use of dephasing time included in semiconductor Bloch equations (SBE), the combination of the SBE model with the thin slab model, and the use of experimentally verified scaling laws for various harmonic orders. For our test, we use a zinc oxide crystal as our standard sample, and our vortex beam is characterized by a topological charge of $l=1$. Our time-domain analysis shows that harmonics within the plateau region specifically contribute to the generation of the attosecond vortex beam. Our findings have implications for advancing the understanding of solid-state HHG and leveraging its strengths, such as the use of thin and dense media, for the efficient generation of short-wavelength attosecond vortex beams.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Nova Z Chamaeleontis in Quiescence and Outburst Using the XMM-Newton Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-ray spectroscopy of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova (DN) Z Cha using the EPIC and RGS instruments onboard the XMM-Newton Observatory. The quiescent system can be modeled by collisional equilibrium or nonequilibrium plasma models, yielding a kT of 8.2-13.0 keV at a luminosity of (5.0-6.0)$\times$10$^{30}$ erg/s. The spectra yield better reduced $\chi^{2}$ using partial covering absorbers of cold and photoionized nature. The ionized absorber has an equivalent N$_H$=(3.4-5.9)$\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a log($\xi$)=3.5-3.7 with (50-60)% covering fraction when VNEI model (XSPEC) is used. The line diagnosis in quiescence shows no resonance lines with only detected forbidden lines of Ne, Mg, Si. The H-like C, O, Ne, and Mg are detected. The strongest line is O VIII with (2.7-4.6)$\times$10$^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. The quiescent X-ray emitting plasma is not collisional and not in ionization equilibrium which is consistent with hot ADAF-like accretion flows. The line diagnosis in outburst shows He-like O, and Ne with intercombination lines being the strongest along with weaker resonance lines. This indicates the plasma is more collisional and denser, but yet not in a collisional equilibrium, revealing ionization timescales of (0.97-1.4)$\times$10$^{11}$ s cm$^{-3}$. The R-ratios in outburst yield electron densities of (7-90)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the G-ratios yield electron temperatures of (2-3)$\times$10$^{6}$ K. The outburst luminosity is (1.4-2.5)$\times$10$^{30}$ erg/s. The flow is inhomogeneous in density. All detected lines are narrow with widths limited by the resolution of RGS yielding Keplerian rotational velocities $&lt;$1000 km/s. This is too low for boundary layers, consistent with the nature of ADAF-like hot flows.</description>

      <title>Efficient and reversible optical-to-spin conversion for solid-state quantum memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-duration and efficient quantum memories for photons are key components of quantum repeater and network applications. To achieve long duration storage in atomic systems, a short-lived optical coherence can be mapped into a long-lived spin coherence, which is the basis for many quantum memory schemes. In this work, we present modeling and measurements of the back-and-forth, i.e. reversible, optical-to-spin conversion for an atomic frequency comb memory. The AFC memory is implemented in $^{151}\textrm{Eu}^{3+}:\textrm{Y}_2\textrm{SiO}_5$ with an applied magnetic field of 231 mT, which allows lifting Zeeman transition degeneracy which otherwise cause time-domain interference in the optical-to-spin conversion. By optimizing the conversion using the developed simulation tool, we achieve a total efficiency of up to 96%, including the spin echo sequence and spin dephasing, for a storage time of 500 $\mu$s. Our methods and results pave the way for long-duration storage of single photon states in 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 with high signal-to-noise, at the millisecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction, its various reduced ones and the relativistic corrections. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic electromagnetic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical, chemical or biological processes at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>
