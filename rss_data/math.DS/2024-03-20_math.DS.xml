      <title>Noisy Fixed Points: Stability of the Invariant Distribution of the Random Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full family of discrete logistic maps has been widely studied both as a canonical example of the period-doubling route to chaos, and as a model of natural processes. In this paper we present a study of the stochastic process described by iterations of the logistic map with a random parameter. In addition to bringing together previously known results, we present a proof that the unique invariant measure of the process in the chaotic regime is asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Double Allee effect induced extinction and bifurcation in a discrete predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of the Allee effect in studying extinction vulnerability is widely recognized by researchers, and neglecting it could adversely impact the management of threatened or exploited populations [1]. In this article, we examine a discrete predator-prey model where the prey population is associated with two component Allee effects. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence and local stability nature of the fixed points of the system. The occurrence of Neimark-Sacker bifurcation is established, and sufficient conditions are obtained along with the normal form. Numerically, we demonstrate that the system exhibits Neimark-Sacker bifurcation for various system parameters. Additionally, the numerical simulations indicate that certain system parameters have threshold values, above or below which the populations are driven to extinction due to the effect of the double Allee effect.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a class of Kolmogorov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional Kolmogorov system with two parameters and having a degenerate condition is studied in this work. We obtain local analytical properties of the system when the parameters vary in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin. The behavior of the system is described by bifurcation diagrams. Applications of Kolmogorov systems can be found particularly in modeling population dynamics in biology and ecology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pick a random matrix $\gamma$ in $\Gamma={\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. Denote by $\mathcal{O}_K$ the Dedekind ring generated by its eigenvalues, and let $\Delta_K$, $\Delta_\gamma$ and $\Delta = {\rm Tr}(\gamma)^2-4$ be the respective discriminant of the rings $\mathcal{O}_K$, the multiplier ring $M(2,\mathbb{Z})\cap \mathbb{Q}[\gamma]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\gamma]$. We show that their ratios admit probability limit distributions. In particular, 42% of the elements of $\Gamma$ have a fundamental discriminant, and $\mathbb{Z}[\gamma]$ is a ring of integers with probability 32%.</description>

      <title>Confined Poisson extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper follows on from our previous work, where we introduced the notion of \emph{confined extensions}, and our purpose is to widen the context in which such extensions appear. We do so in the setup of Poisson suspensions: we take a $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving dynamical system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$, then we consider the corresponding Poisson extension $((X \times G)^*, (\mu \otimes m_G)^*, (T_\phi)_*) \overset{}{\to} (X^*, \mu^*, T_*)$. Our results give two different conditions under which that extension is confined. Finally, to show that those conditions are not void, we give an example of a system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a cocycle $\phi$ so that the compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$ has an infinite ergodic index.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduced-Order Unknown-Input Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a data-driven approach to the design of reduced-order unknown-input observers (rUIOs). We first recall the model-based solution, by assuming a problem set-up slightly different from those traditionally adopted in the literature, in order to be able to easily adapt it to the data-driven scenario. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a reduced-order unknown-input observer, whose matrices can be derived from a sufficiently rich set of collected historical data, are first derived and then proved to be equivalent to the ones obtained in the model-based framework. Finally, a numerical example is presented, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Group Extensions for Random Shifts of Finite Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic dynamical theory plays an important role in the research of amenability with a countable group. Motivated by the deep results of Dougall and Sharp, we study the group extensions for topologically mixing random shifts of finite type. For a countable group $G$, we consider the potential connections between relative Gurevi\v{c} pressure (entropy), the spectral radius of random Perron-Frobenius operator and amenability of $G$. Given $G^{\rm ab}$ by the abelianization of $G$ where $G^{\rm ab}=G/[G,G]$, we consider the random group extensions of random shifts of finite type between $G$ and $G^{\rm ab}$. It can be proved that the relative Gurevi\v{c} entropy of random group $G$ extensions is equal to the relative Gurevi\v{c} entropy of random group $G^{\rm ab}$ extensions if and only if $G$ is amenable. Moreover, we establish the relativized variational principle and discuss the unique equilibrium state for random group $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ extensions.</description>

      <title>The Simple Yield Curve Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With $P_t$ the price in current dollars of a dollar delivered $t$ time units from now, we assume that $P$ is a decreasing function defined for $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$ with $P_0 = 1$. The negative logarithmic derivative, $- \stackrel{\bullet}{P}_t/P_t$ defines the yield curve function $Y_t$. An $n$ parameter linear yield curve model selects as allowable yield curves $Y_t(r) = \sum_{i=1}^n r_i Y^i_t$ with the functions $Y^i$ fixed and with $r$ varying over an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ on which $Y_t(r) \ge 0$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$. For example, the flat yield curve model with $P_t(r) = e^{-rt}$ is a one parameter linear model with $Y^1_t(r) = r &gt; 0$. We impose two natural economic requirements on the model: (SPA) static prices allowed, i.e. it is always possible that as time moves forward, relative prices do not change, and (NLA) no local arbitrage, i.e. there does not exist a self-financing bundle of futures such that the zero present value is a local minimum with respect to small changes in the space of admissible yield curves. In that case the model always contains one of four simple models. If we impose the additional requirement (LRE) long rates exist, i.e. for every $r$ $Lim_{t \to \infty} Y_t(r)$ exists as a finite limit, then the number of simple models is reduced to two.</description>

      <title>A direct proof of the existence of MME for finite horizon Sinai billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sinai billiard map $T$ on the two-torus, i.e., the periodic Lorentz gaz, is a discontinuous map. Assuming finite horizon and bounded complexity, we prove that the Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy map associated with the billiard map $T$ is upper semi-continuous, as well as the compactness of the set of $T$-invariant measures. In particular, for the potentials $g \equiv 0$ and $g = -h_{\rm top}(\Phi_1) \tau$, we recover the recent results of the existence of measures of maximal entropy (MME) for both the billiard map and flow $\Phi_t$, due to Baladi and Demers for $T$, jointly with Carrand for $\Phi_t$. For general finite horizon Sinai billiards, we provide bounds on the defect of upper semi-continuity of the entropy map and on the topological tail entropy. The bounded complexity condition is expected to hold generically.</description>

      <title>Mean Value Theorems in Multiplicative Systems and Joint Ergodicity of Additive and Multiplicative Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the study of additive ergodic averages in multiplicative systems and the investigation of the "pretentious" dynamical behaviour of these systems. We prove a mean ergodic theorem (Theorem A) that generalises Hal\'asz's mean value theorem for finitely generated multiplicative functions taking values in the unit circle. In addition, we obtain two structural results concerning the "pretentious" dynamical behaviour of finitely generated multiplicative systems. Moreover, motivated by the independence principle between additive and multiplicative structures of the integers, we explore the joint ergodicity (as a natural notion of independence) of an additive and a finitely generated multiplicative action, both acting on the same probability space. In Theorem B, we show that such actions are jointly ergodic whenever no "local obstructions" arise, and we give a concrete description of these "local obstructions". As an application, we obtain some new combinatorial results regarding arithmetic configurations in large sets of integers including refinements of a special case of Szemer\'edi's theorem.</description>

      <title>Syntropy in complex systems: A complement to Shannon's Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the syntropy function ($S_N$) and expectancy function ($E_N$), derived from the novel function $\phi$, to provide a refined perspective on complexity, extending beyond conventional entropy analysis. $S_N$ is designed to detect localized coherent events, whereas $E_N$ encapsulates expected system behaviors, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding system dynamics. The manuscript explores essential theorems and properties, underscoring their theoretical and practical implications. Future research will further elucidate their roles, particularly in biological signals and dynamic systems, suggesting a deep interplay between order and chaos.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Spatiotemporal Data via Multivariate Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modal analysis has become an essential tool to understand the coherent structure of complex flows. The classical modal analysis methods, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), rely on a sufficient amount of data that is regularly sampled in time. However, often one needs to deal with sparse temporally irregular data, e.g., due to experimental measurements and simulation algorithm. To overcome the limitations of data scarcity and irregular sampling, we propose a novel modal analysis technique using multi-variate Gaussian process regression (MVGPR). We first establish the connection between MVGPR and the existing modal analysis techniques, DMD and SPOD, from a linear system identification perspective. Next, leveraging this connection, we develop a MVGPR-based modal analysis technique that addresses the aforementioned limitations. The capability of MVGPR is endowed by its judiciously designed kernel structure for correlation function, that is derived from the assumed linear dynamics. Subsequently, the proposed MVGPR method is benchmarked against DMD and SPOD on a range of examples, from academic and synthesized data to unsteady airfoil aerodynamics. The results demonstrate MVGPR as a promising alternative to classical modal analysis methods, especially in the scenario of scarce and temporally irregular data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.11620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a context of non-uniformly expanding maps, possibly with the presence of a critical set, we prove the existence of finitely many ergodic equilibrium states for hyperbolic potentials. Moreover, the equilibrium states are expanding measures. This generalizes a result due to Ramos and Viana, where analytical methods are used for maps with no critical sets. The strategy here consists in using a finite number of inducing schemes with a Markov structure in infinitely many symbols to code the dynamics, to obtain an equilibrium state for the associated symbolic dynamics and then projecting it to obtain an equilibrium state for the original map. We apply our results to the important class of multidimensional Viana maps.</description>

Abstract: For geometrically finite group actions on hyperbolic metric spaces and under certain assumptions on the growth of parabolic subgroups, we prove a global shadow lemma for Patterson-Sullivan measures, as well as a Dirichlet-type theorem and a logarithm law for excursion of geodesics into cusps.

      <description>arXiv:2301.02301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a family of tent-like maps with bounded derivatives has no linear response for typical deterministic perturbations changing the value of the turning point. In this note we prove the following result: if we consider a tent-like family with a \emph{cusp} at the turning point, we recover the linear response.
  More precisely, let $T_\eps$ be a family of such cusp maps generated by changing the value of the turning point of $T_0$ by a deterministic perturbation and let $h_\eps$ be the corresponding invariant density. We prove that $\eps\mapsto h_\eps$ is differentiable in $L^1$ and provide a formula for its derivative.</description>

      <title>Approximating reproduction numbers: a general numerical method for age-structured models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general numerical method to approximate the reproduction numbers of a large class of multi-group, age-structured, population models with a finite age span. To provide complete flexibility in the definition of the birth and transition processes, we propose an equivalent formulation for the age-integrated state within the extended space framework. Then, we discretize the birth and transition operators via pseudospectral collocation. We discuss applications to epidemic models with continuous and piecewise continuous rates, with different interpretations of the age variable (e.g., demographic age, infection age and disease age) and the transmission terms (e.g., horizontal and vertical transmission). The tests illustrate that the method can compute different reproduction numbers, including the basic and type reproduction numbers as special cases.</description>
