      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for correctness of complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a family of correctness conditions for complex Langevin simulations. In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation values of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's Schwinger--Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation values are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in the context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general probability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on a real manifold. We test these criteria in a few simple one- and two-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out incorrect results without the need of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product Operator Constructions for Gauge Theories in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low dimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.</description>

      <title>The role of the pion mass on the QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the role of the pion mass on the QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane using an effective model treatment. Such treatments are able to capture the main features predicted by first-principles calculations. We also employed the model to estimate the pion mass beyond which the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect disappears. The value is found to be independent of the strength of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Extending DD-$\alpha$AMG on heterogeneous machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are the standard in modern scientific computing simulations. Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also known as the DD-$\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic multigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has made it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations otherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the development and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area. From an existing version of DD-$\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to run some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we translate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We moreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\alpha$AMG, paying particular attention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led to a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower compared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of GMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally intensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid renormalization for distribution amplitude of a light baryon in large momentum effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes for a light baryon can be extracted through the simulation of the quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) on the lattice. We implement the hybrid renormalization for the quasi DAs of light baryons. Lattice simulations are performed using $N_f = 2+1$ stout-smeared clover fermions and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action, with three lattice spacings of ${0.105, 0.077, 0.052}$ fm. By analyzing zero-momentum matrix elements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence associated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix elements in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual self-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs within the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large separations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results demonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth, continuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier transformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability of both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs, providing a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone distribution amplitudes.</description>
