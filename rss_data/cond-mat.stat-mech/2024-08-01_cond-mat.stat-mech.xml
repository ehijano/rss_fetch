      <title>Optimal control of levitated nanoparticles through finite-stiffness confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control of levitated particles subject to thermal fluctuations is a challenging problem, both from the theoretical and the experimental perspective. In this paper we compute the time-dependent harmonic confining potential that steers a Brownian particle between two assigned equilibrium states, in a prescribed time, with the minimum energetic cost. In our analysis we do not neglect inertial effects (thus addressing the general underdamped dynamics) and we assume, motivated by the experiments, that the stiffness of the confining potential cannot exceed prescribed bounds. We report the results of an experiment realizing the described protocol for an optically confined nanoparticle. The system is shown to reach the target state within accuracy, while spending less energy than other protocols that require the same time. The optimal protocol is also compared to an abrupt change of the confining stiffness, the latter involving an exponential relaxation to the target equilibrium state. Not only does our optimal protocol reach the target state in a finite time but it does so in a time significantly shorter than the characteristic timescale of the direct relaxation. The results presented in this paper are expected to have relevant applications in the design of optimal devices, e.g. engines at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the continuous-time random walk using subordination schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous time random walk model has been widely applied in various fields, including physics, biology, chemistry, finance, social phenomena, etc. In this work, we present an algorithm that utilizes a subordinate formula to generate data of the continuous time random walk in the long time limit. The algorithm has been validated using commonly employed observables, such as typical fluctuations of the positional distribution, rare fluctuations, the mean and the variance of the position, and breakthrough curves with time-dependent bias, demonstrating a perfect match.</description>

      <title>Force and kinetics of fast and slow muscle myosin determined with a synthetic sarcomere-like nanomachine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myosin II is the muscle molecular motor that works in two bipolar arrays in each thick filament of the striated (skeletal and cardiac) muscle, converting the chemical energy into steady force and shortening by cyclic ATP--driven interactions with the nearby actin filaments. Different isoforms of the myosin motor in the skeletal muscles account for the different functional requirements of the slow muscles (primarily responsible for the posture) and fast muscles (responsible for voluntary movements). To clarify the molecular basis of the differences, here the isoform--dependent mechanokinetic parameters underpinning the force of slow and fast muscles are defined with a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure myosin isoforms from either slow or fast rabbit skeletal muscle. Data fitting with a stochastic model provides a self--consistent estimate of all the mechanokinetic properties of the motor ensemble including the motor force, the fraction of actin--attached motors and the rate of transition through the attachment--detachment cycle. The achievements in this paper set the stage for any future study on the emergent mechanokinetic properties of an ensemble of myosin molecules either engineered or purified from mutant animal models or human biopsies.</description>

      <title>Moderately dense granular gas of inelastic rough spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kinetic theory for moderately dense gases of inelastic and rough spherical molecules is developed from the Enskog equation where a macroscopic state is characterized by 29 scalar fields which correspond to the moments of the distribution function: mass density, hydrodynamic velocity, pressure tensor, absolute temperature, translational and rotational heat fluxes, hydrodynamic angular velocity and angular velocity flux. The balance equations for the 29 scalar fields are obtained from a transfer equation derived from the Enskog equation where the kinetic and potential parts of the new moments of the distribution function and production terms are calculated from Grad's distribution function for the basic fields. The transition from the 29 field theory to an eight field theory -- with mass density, hydrodynamic velocity, absolute temperature and hydrodynamic angular velocity -- leads to the determination of the transport coefficients of the Navier-Stokes and Fourier laws. The transport coefficients are functions of the normal and tangential restitution coefficients and of the local equilibrium radial distribution function. The transport coefficients in the limiting case of elastic rough spheres is also determined.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum or classical many-body Hamiltonian systems, whose dynamics is given by an integrable, contact interactions, plus another, possibly long-range, generic two-body potential. We show how the dynamics of local observables is given in terms of a generalised version of Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy, which we denote as gBBGKY, which is built for the densities, and their correlations, of the quasiparticles of the underlying integrable model. Unlike the usual cases of perturbation theory from free gases, the presence of local interactions in the integrable model "lifts" the so-called kinetic blocking, and the second layer of the hierarchy reproduces the dynamics at all time-scales. The latter consists of a fast pre-equilibration to a non-thermal steady state, and its subsequent thermalisation to a Gibbs ensemble. We show how the final relaxation is encoded into a Boltzmann scattering integral involving three or higher body-scatterings, and which, remarkably, is entirely determined by the diffusion constants of the underlying integrable model. We check our results with exact molecular dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. Our results show how gBBGKY can be successfully employed in quantum systems to compute scattering integrals and Fermi's golden rule transition rates.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of Dynamical Phase Transitions in One-Dimensional XY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-time transient dynamical phase transition (SDQPT), serving as the theoretical framework on far-from-equilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems, has been experimentally observed recently. However, the existence of different types of SDQPTs and the associated conditions are yet to be elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively classify SDQPTs by considering the one-dimensional transverse field quantum XY model initialized in the ground state. We find that there are only six types of SDQPTs, and three of which are completely new that had not yet been identified previously. The associated conditions for different SDQPTs are discussed in detail, and based on this, the dynamical phase diagrams are given. Our analytical method used to classify SDQPTs in one-dimensional transverse field quantum XY model can be applied to any other two-band models in one- and two-spatial dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Stimulated by the successful descriptions of strongly correlated electron systems by fractionalized fermions, correspondence between interacting fermions and non-interacting multi-component fermions is formulated in examples of the Hubbard model. The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for a quantum many-body solver represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After showing the exact correspondence of 1- and 2-site Hubbard model to two-component noninteracting fermions, numerical algorithm of the quantum machine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site systems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact angle size dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact angle cosine for axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a widely used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the leading-order contact-line-related contribution and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using contact angle size dependences for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets at the same conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing the exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles that are classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We explore the statistics of each cycle type and its duration, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of the same type. Our framework presents a novel approach in characterizing thermal machines, with significant relevance to modern experiments, such as mesoscopic transport using quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the perfect transfer of information in 1+1D continuous quantum systems. This includes effective descriptions of inhomogeneous spin chains, for which the notion of perfect state transfer in quantum information was introduced, and here phrased in terms of waves. We show that reflection symmetry is necessary for perfect wave transfer (PWT) in any inhomogeneous conformal field theory, and even sufficient when restricted to one-particle excitations. To determine if or when it is sufficient more generally, we first break conformal invariance and study a broad class of 1+1D bosonic theories. We show that the question can then be posed as an inverse Sturm-Liouville problem that determines when the bosonic theory exhibits PWT. We demonstrate how to uniquely solve this problem, which also shows that reflection symmetry is sufficient for the special case with conformal invariance. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend these notions to interacting quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scalings of fluctuations of the area swept by a Brownian particle trapped in a $|x|$ potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the area $A=\int_0^T x(t) dt$ under a one-dimensional Brownian motion $x(t)$ in a trapping potential $\sim |x|$, at long times $T\to\infty$. We find that typical fluctuations of $A$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a variance that grows linearly in time (at large $T$), as do all higher cumulants of the distribution. However, large deviations of $A$ are not described by the ``usual'' scaling (i.e., the large deviations principle), and are instead described by two different anomalous scaling behaviors: Moderately-large deviations of $A$, obey the anomalous scaling $P\left(A;T\right)\sim e^{-T^{1/3}f\left(A/T^{2/3}\right)}$ while very large deviations behave as $P\left(A;T\right)\sim e^{-T\Psi\left(A/T^{2}\right)}$. We find the associated rate functions $f$ and $\Psi$ exactly. Each of the two functions contains a singularity, which we interpret as dynamical phase transitions of the first and third order, respectively. We uncover the origin of these striking behaviors by characterizing the most likely scenario(s) for the system to reach a given atypical value of $A$. We extend our analysis by studying the absolute area $B=\int_0^T|x(t)| dt$ and also by generalizing to higher spatial dimension, focusing on the particular case of three dimensions.</description>

      <title>3D Tensor Renormalisation Group at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon previous $2D$ studies, this research focuses on describing $3D$ tensor renormalisation group (RG) flows for lattice spin systems, such as the Ising model. We present a novel RG map, which operates on tensors with infinite-dimensional legs and does not involve truncations, in contrast to numerical tensor RG maps. To construct this map, we developed new techniques for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model. This leads to the iterated RG map convergence in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to $A_*$ when initialised in the vicinity of $A_*$. This work provides the first steps towards the rigorous understanding of tensor RG maps in $3D$.</description>

      <title>Survival Probability, Particle Imbalance, and Their Relationship in Quadratic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the dynamics of particle imbalance in quadratic fermionic models is, for the majority of initial many-body product states in site occupation basis, virtually indistinguishable from the dynamics of survival probabilities of single-particle states. We then generalize our statement to a similar relationship between the non-equal time and space density correlation functions in many-body states and the transition probabilities of single-particle states at nonzero distances. Finally, we study the equal time connected density-density correlation functions in many-body states, which exhibit certain qualitative analogies with the survival and transition probabilities of single-particle states. Our results are numerically tested for two paradigmatic models of single-particle localization: the 3D Anderson model and the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model. This work gives affirmative answer to the question whether it is possible to measure features of the single-particle survival and transition probabilities by the dynamics of observables in many-body states.</description>

Abstract: We study measurement-induced phases of free fermion systems with U(1) symmetry. Following a recent approach developed for Majorana chains, we derive a field theory description for the purity and bipartite entanglement at large space and time scales. We focus on a multi-flavor one-dimensional chain with random complex hoppings and continuous monitoring of the local fermion density. By means of the replica trick, and using the number of flavors as a large parameter controlling our approximations, we derive an effective field theory made up of a SU(N) non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) coupled to fluctuating hydrodynamics. Contrary to the case of non-interacting Majorana fermions, displaying no U(1) symmetry, we find that the bipartite entanglement entropy satisfies an area law for all monitoring rates, but with a nontrivial scaling of entanglement when the correlation length is large. We provide numerical evidence supporting our claims. We briefly show how imposing a reality condition on the hoppings can change the NL$\sigma$M and also discuss higher dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This implies the presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite chain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model (9).</description>

      <title>Disorder driven topological phase transitions in 1D mechanical quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the transition from trivial to non-trivial phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model subjected to disorder in a quasi-periodic environment. We analytically determine the phase boundary, and characterize the localization of normal modes using their inverse participation ratio. We compute energy-dependent mobility edges and provide evidence for the emergence of a topological Anderson insulator within specific parameter ranges. Whereas the phase transition boundary is affected by the quasi-periodic modulation, the topologically insulating Anderson phase is stable with respect to the chiral disorder in a quasi-periodic setup. Additionally, our results also uncover a re-entrant topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial phases for certain values of quasi-periodic modulation with fixed chiral disorder.</description>

Abstract: We present the first principles construction of the low-energy effective action for bosonic self-organized quantum quasicrystals. Our generalized elasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding conjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the Goldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we obtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic speed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between phononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the latter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a longitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound. Finally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high density phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulator phases in one dimensional quasi-periodic mechanical SSH chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transition between topological phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model composed of springs and masses in which the intracellular quasi-periodic disorder modulates the spring constants. We observe the presence of a topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phase within a specific range of quasi-periodic modulation strength and calculate the phase transition boundary analytically. We examine the localization properties of the normal modes using the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of eigenstates of the dynamical matrix, and the corresponding fractal dimension associated with quasiperiodic modulation. We also examine the stability of the TAI phase across a range of modulation strengths and comments on the presence of mobility edge that separate localized modes from non-localized ones. We demonstrate the fact that special analytical techniques are needed to compute an exact expression for mobility edges in such scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortex lattice: Lifshitz duality, topological defects and multipole symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an effective field theory of a vortex lattice in a two-dimensional neutral rotating superfluid. Utilizing particle-vortex dualities, we explore its formulation in terms of a $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to elasticity, that at low energies reduces to a compact Lifshitz theory augmented with a Berry phase term encoding the vortex dynamics in the presence of a superflow. Utilizing elasticity- and Lifshitz-gauge theory dualities, we derive dual formulations of the vortex lattice in terms of a traceless symmetric scalar-charge theory and demonstrate low-energy equivalence of our dual gauge theory to its elasticity-gauge theory dual. We further discuss a multipole symmetry of the vortex lattice and its dual gauge theory's multipole one-form symmetries. We also study its topological crystalline defects, where the multipole one-form symmetry plays a prominent role. It classifies the defects, explains their restricted mobility, and characterizes descendant vortex phases, which includes a novel vortex supersolid phase. Using the dual gauge theory, we also develop a mean-field theory for the quantum melting transition from a vortex crystal to a vortex supersolid.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Pseudomodes for Strongly Coupled Open Quantum Systems: Unravelings, Correlations and Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudomode framework provides an exact description of the dynamics of an open quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian environment. Using this framework, the influence of the environment on the system is studied in an equivalent model, where the open system is coupled to a finite number of unphysical pseudomodes that follow a time-local master equation. Building on the insight that this master equation does not need to conserve the hermiticity of the pseudomode state, we here ask for the most general conditions on the master equation that guarantee the correct reproduction of the system's original dynamics. We demonstrate that our generalized approach decreases the number of pseudomodes that are required to model, for example, underdamped environments at finite temperature. We also provide an unraveling of the master equation into quantum jump trajectories of non-Hermitian states, which further facilitates the utilization of the pseudomode technique for numerical calculations by enabling the use of easily parallelizable Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we show that pseudomodes, despite their unphysical nature, provide a natural picture in which physical processes, such as the creation of system-bath correlations or the exchange of heat, can be studied. Hence, our results pave the way for future investigations of the system-environment interaction leading to a better understanding of open quantum systems far from the Markovian weak-coupling limit.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Emulations in Classical Spin Models: Modularity and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of spin models intersects with condensed matter physics, complex systems, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, computational complexity and neural networks. Many ensuing applications rely on the fact that complicated spin models can be transformed to simpler ones. What is the structure of such transformations? Here, we provide a framework to study and construct emulations between spin models. A spin model is a set of spin systems, and emulations are efficiently computable simulations with arbitrary energy cut-off, where a source spin system simulates a target system if, below the cut-off, the target Hamiltonian is encoded in the source Hamiltonian. We prove that emulations preserve important properties, as they induce reductions between computational problems such as computing ground states, approximating partition functions and approximate sampling from Boltzmann distributions. Emulations are modular (they can be added, scaled and composed), and allow for universality, i.e. certain spin models have maximal reach. We prove that a spin model is universal if and only if it is scalable, closed and functional complete. Because the characterization is constructive, it provides a step-by-step guide to construct emulations. We prove that the 2d Ising model with fields is universal, for which we also provide two new crossing gadgets. Finally, we show that simulations can be computed by linear programs. While some ideas of this work are contained in [1], we provide new definitions and theorems. This framework provides a toolbox for applications involving emulations of spin models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the overlap distribution of branching Brownian motion at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At high temperature, the overlap of two particles chosen independently according to the Gibbs measure of the branching Brownian motion converges to zero as time goes to infinity. We investigate the precise decay rate of the probability to obtain an overlap greater than $a$, for some $a&gt;0$, in the whole subcritical phase of inverse temperatures $\beta \in [0,\beta_c)$. Moreover, we study this probability both conditionally on the branching Brownian motion and non-conditionally. Two sub-phases of inverse temperatures appear, but surprisingly the threshold is not the same in both cases.</description>
