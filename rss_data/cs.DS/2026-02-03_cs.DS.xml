      <title>End Cover for Initial Value Problem: Complete Validated Algorithms with Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the first-order autonomous ordinary differential equation \[ \mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}), \] where $\mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is locally Lipschitz. For a box $B_0 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $h &gt; 0$, we denote by $\mathrm{IVP}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h)$ the set of solutions $\mathbf{x} : [0,h] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying \[ \mathbf{x}'(t) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(t)), \qquad \mathbf{x}(0) \in B_0 . \]
  We present a complete validated algorithm for the following \emph{End Cover Problem}: given $(\mathbf{f}, B_0, \varepsilon, h)$, compute a finite set $\mathcal{C}$ of boxes such that \[ \mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) \;\subseteq\; \bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{C}} B \;\subseteq\; \mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) \oplus [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]^n , \] where \[ \mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) = \left\{ \mathbf{x}(h) : \mathbf{x} \in \mathrm{IVP}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h) \right\}. \]
  Moreover, we provide a complexity analysis of our algorithm and introduce a novel technique for computing the end cover $\mathcal{C}$ based on covering the boundary of $\mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{f}}(B_0,h)$. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating the practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Hardness and Tractability of T_{h+1}-Free Edge Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00644v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of the T(h+1)-Free Edge Deletion problem. Given a graph G and integers k and h, the task is to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has size at most h. The problem is NP-complete for every fixed h at least 3, while it is solvable in polynomial time for h at most 2.
  Recent work showed strong hardness barriers: the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the solution size together with the size of a feedback edge set, ruling out fixed-parameter tractability for many classical structural parameters. We significantly strengthen these negative results by proving W[1]-hardness when parameterized by the vertex deletion distance to a disjoint union of paths, the vertex deletion distance to a disjoint union of stars, or the twin cover number. These results unify and extend known hardness results for treewidth, pathwidth, and feedback vertex set, and show that several restrictive parameters, including treedepth, cluster vertex deletion number, and modular width, do not yield fixed-parameter tractability when h is unbounded.
  On the positive side, we identify parameterizations that restore tractability. We show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by cluster vertex deletion together with h, vertex deletion set into a clique and also when parameterized by neighborhood diversity together with h via an integer linear programming formulation. We further present a fixed-parameter tractable bicriteria approximation algorithm parameterized by k. Finally, we show that the problem admits fixed-parameter tractable algorithms on split graphs and interval graphs, and we establish hardness for a directed generalization even on directed acyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Fanciful Figurines flip Free Flood-It -- Polynomial-Time Miniature Painting on Co-gem-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the eponymous hobby, we introduce Miniature Painting as the computational problem to paint a given graph $G=(V,E)$ according to a prescribed template $t \colon V \rightarrow C$, which assigns colors $C$ to the vertices of $G$. In this setting, the goal is to realize the template using a shortest possible sequence of brush strokes, where each stroke overwrites a connected vertex subset with a color in $C$. We show that this problem is equivalent to a reversal of the well-studied Free Flood-It game, in which a colored graph is decolored into a single color using as few moves as possible. This equivalence allows known complexity results for Free Flood-It to be transferred directly to Miniature Painting, including NP-hardness under severe structural restrictions, such as when $G$ is a grid, a tree, or a split graph. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm for Miniature Painting on graphs that are free of induced co-gems, a graph class that strictly generalizes cographs. As a direct consequence, Free Flood-It is also polynomial-time solvable on co-gem-free graphs, independent of the initial coloring.</description>

      <title>Fast $k$-means Seeding Under The Manifold Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study beyond worst case analysis for the $k$-means problem where the goal is to model typical instances of $k$-means arising in practice. Existing theoretical approaches provide guarantees under certain assumptions on the optimal solutions to $k$-means, making them difficult to validate in practice. We propose the manifold hypothesis, where data obtained in ambient dimension $D$ concentrates around a low dimensional manifold of intrinsic dimension $d$, as a reasonable assumption to model real world clustering instances. We identify key geometric properties of datasets which have theoretically predictable scaling laws depending on the quantization exponent $\varepsilon = 2/d$ using techniques from optimum quantization theory. We show how to exploit these regularities to design a fast seeding method called $\operatorname{Qkmeans}$ which provides $O(\rho^{-2} \log k)$ approximate solutions to the $k$-means problem in time $O(nD) + \widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{1+\rho}\rho^{-1}k^{1+\gamma})$; where the exponent $\gamma = \varepsilon + \rho$ for an input parameter $\rho &lt; 1$. This allows us to obtain new runtime - quality tradeoffs. We perform a large scale empirical study across various domains to validate our theoretical predictions and algorithm performance to bridge theory and practice for beyond worst case data clustering.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of algorithms for set partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set partitions are arrangements of distinct objects into groups. The problem of listing all set partitions arises in a variety of settings, in particular in combinatorial optimization tasks. After a brief review, we give practical approximate formulas for determining the number of set partitions, both for small and large set sizes. Several algorithms for enumerating all set partitions are reviewed, and benchmarking tests were conducted. The algorithm of Djokic et al. is recommended for practical use.</description>

      <title>A $5$-Approximation Analysis for the Cover Small Cuts Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Cover Small Cuts problem, we are given a capacitated (undirected) graph $G=(V,E,u)$ and a threshold value $\lambda$, as well as a set of links $L$ with end-nodes in $V$ and a non-negative cost for each link $\ell\in L$; the goal is to find a minimum-cost set of links such that each non-trivial cut of capacity less than $\lambda$ is covered by a link. Bansal, Cheriyan, Grout, and Ibrahimpur (arXiv:2209.11209, Algorithmica 2024) showed that the WGMV primal-dual algorithm, due to Williamson, Goemans, Mihail, and Vazirani (Combinatorica, 1995), achieves approximation ratio $16$ for the Cover Small Cuts problem; their analysis uses the notion of a pliable family of sets that satisfies a combinatorial property. Later, Bansal (arXiv:2308.15714v2, IPCO 2025) and then Nutov (arXiv:2504.03910, MFCS 2025) proved that the same algorithm achieves approximation ratio $6$. We show that the same algorithm achieves approximation ratio $5$, by using a stronger notion, namely, a pliable family of sets that satisfies symmetry and structural submodularity.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing high-bandwidth graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unweighted, undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes is said to have \emph{bandwidth} at most $k$ if its nodes can be labelled from $0$ to $n - 1$ such that no two adjacent nodes have labels that differ by more than $k$. It is known that one can decide whether the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $k$ in $O(n^k)$ time and $O(n^k)$ space using dynamic programming techniques. For small $k$ close to $0$, this approach is effectively polynomial, but as $k$ scales with $n$, it becomes superexponential, requiring up to $O(n^{n - 1})$ time (where $n - 1$ is the maximum possible bandwidth). In this paper, we reformulate the problem in terms of bipartite matching for sufficiently large $k \ge \lfloor (n - 1)/2 \rfloor$, allowing us to use Hall's marriage theorem to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(n^{n - k + 1})$ time and $O(n)$ auxiliary space (beyond storage of the input graph). This yields polynomial complexity for large $k$ close to $n - 1$, demonstrating that the bandwidth recognition problem is solvable in polynomial time whenever either $k$ or $n - k$ remains small.</description>

      <title>A Fault-Tolerant Version of Safra's Termination Detection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safra's distributed termination detection algorithm employs a logical token ring structure within a distributed network; only passive nodes forward the token, and a counter in the token keeps track of the number of sent minus the number of received messages. We adapt this classic algorithm to make it fault-tolerant. The counter is split into counters per node, to discard counts from crashed nodes. If a node crashes, the token ring is restored locally and a backup token is sent. Nodes inform each other of detected crashes via the token. Our algorithm imposes no additional message overhead, tolerates any number of crashes as well as simultaneous crashes, and copes with crashes in a decentralized fashion. Correctness proofs are provided of both the original Safra's algorithm and its fault-tolerant variant, as well as a model checking analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-Clashing Teaching in Graphs: Algorithms, Complexity, and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and proved that it is the most efficient batch machine teaching model satisfying the collusion-avoidance benchmark established in the seminal work of Goldman and Mathias [COLT 1993]. Recently, (positive) non-clashing teaching was thoroughly studied for balls in graphs, yielding numerous algorithmic and combinatorial results. In particular, Chalopin et al. [COLT 2024] and Ganian et al. [ICLR 2025] gave an almost complete picture of the complexity landscape of the positive variant, showing that it is tractable only for restricted graph classes due to the non-trivial nature of the problem and concept class.
  In this work, we consider (positive) non-clashing teaching for closed neighborhoods in graphs. This concept class is not only extensively studied in various related contexts, but it also exhibits broad generality, as any finite binary concept class can be equivalently represented by a set of closed neighborhoods in a graph. In comparison to the works on balls in graphs, we provide improved algorithmic results, notably including FPT algorithms for more general classes of parameters, and we complement these results by deriving stronger lower bounds. Lastly, we obtain combinatorial upper bounds for wider classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Time Quantum Algorithm for Attention Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the query, key and value matrices $Q, K, V\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, the attention module is defined as $\mathrm{Att}(Q, K, V)=D^{-1}AV$ where $A=\exp(QK^\top/\sqrt{d})$ with $\exp(\cdot)$ applied entrywise, $D=\mathrm{diag}(A{\bf 1}_n)$. The attention module is the backbone of modern transformers and large language models, but explicitly forming the softmax matrix $D^{-1}A$ incurs $\Omega(n^2)$ time, motivating numerous approximation schemes that reduce runtime to $\widetilde O(nd)$ via sparsity or low-rank factorization.
  We propose a quantum data structure that approximates any row of $\mathrm{Att}(Q, K, V)$ using only row queries to $Q, K, V$. Our algorithm preprocesses these matrices in $\widetilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} n^{0.5} \left( s_\lambda^{2.5} + s_\lambda^{1.5} d + \alpha^{0.5} d \right) \right)$ time, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy, $s_\lambda$ is the $\lambda$-statistical dimension of the exponential kernel defined by $Q$ and $K$, and $\alpha$ measures the row distortion of $V$ that is at most $d/{\rm srank}(V)$, the stable rank of $V$. Each row query can be answered in $\widetilde{O}(s_\lambda^2 + s_\lambda d)$ time.
  To our knowledge, this is the first quantum data structure that approximates rows of the attention matrix in sublinear time with respect to $n$. Our approach relies on a quantum Nystr\"om approximation of the exponential kernel, quantum multivariate mean estimation for computing $D$, and quantum leverage score sampling for the multiplication with $V$.</description>

      <title>Hallucination is a Consequence of Space-Optimality: A Rate-Distortion Theorem for Membership Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00906v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set of $n$ circular arcs of the same radius in the plane, we consider the problem of computing the number of intersections among the arcs. The problem was studied before and the previously best algorithm solves the problem in $O(n^{4/3+\epsilon})$ time [Agarwal, Pellegrini, and Sharir, SIAM J. Comput., 1993], for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$. No progress has been made on the problem for more than 30 years. We present a new algorithm of $O(n^{4/3}\log^{16/3}n)$ time and improve it to $O(n^{1+\epsilon}+K^{1/3}n^{2/3}(\frac{n^2}{n+K})^{\epsilon}\log^{16/3}n)$ time for small $K$, where $K$ is the number of intersections of all arcs.</description>

      <title>Profit Maximization in Closed Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion of information, innovation, and ideas is an important phenomenon in social networks. Information propagates through the network and reaches from one person to the next. In many settings, it is meaningful to restrict diffusion so that each node can spread information to only a limited number of its neighbors rather than to all of them. Such social networks are called closed social networks. In recent years, social media platforms have emerged as an effective medium for commercial entities, where the objective is to maximize profit. In this paper, we study the Profit Maximization in Closed Social Networks (PMCSN) problem in the context of viral marketing. The input to the problem is a closed social network and two positive integers $\ell$ and $B$. The problem asks to select seed nodes within a given budget $B$; during the diffusion process, each node is restricted to choose at most $\ell$ outgoing links for information diffusion; and the objective is to maximize the profit earned by the seed set. The PMCSN problem generalizes the Influence Maximization problem, which is NP-hard. We propose two solution approaches for PMCSN: a sampling-based approximate solution and a marginal-gain-based heuristic solution. We analyze the sample complexity, running time, and space requirements of the proposed approaches. We conduct experiments on real-world, publicly available social network datasets. The results show that the seed sets and diffusion links chosen by our methods yield higher profit than baseline methods. The implementation and data are available at \texttt{https://github.com/PoonamSharma-PY/ClosedNetwork}.</description>

      <title>Totally $\Delta$-Modular Tree Decompositions of Graphic Matrices for Integer Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the tree-decomposition-based parameter totally $\Delta$-modular treewidth (TDM-treewidth) for matrices with two nonzero entries per row. We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Finite and Corruption-Robust Regret Bounds in Online Inverse Linear Optimization under M-Convex Action Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online inverse linear optimization, also known as contextual recommendation, where a learner sequentially infers an agent's hidden objective vector from observed optimal actions over feasible sets that change over time. The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\exp(O(d\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument. Moreover, we extend our approach to adversarially corrupted feedback in up to $C$ rounds. We obtain a regret bound of $O((C+1)d\log d)$ without prior knowledge of $C$, by monitoring directed graphs induced by the observed feedback to detect corruptions adaptively.</description>

      <title>Stable Matching with Predictions: Robustness and Efficiency under Pruned Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of finding a stable matching in two-sided matching markets. In the classic variant, it is assumed that both sides of the market submit a ranked list of all agents on the other side. However, in large matching markets such as the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), it is infeasible for hospitals to interview or mutually rank each resident. In this paper, we study the stable matching problem with truncated preference lists. In particular, we assume that, based on historical datasets, each hospital has a predicted rank of its likely match and only ranks residents within a bounded interval around that prediction.
  We use the algorithms-with-predictions framework and show that the classic deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm used to compute stable matchings is robust to such truncation. We present two algorithms and theoretically and empirically evaluate their performance. Our results show that even with reasonably accurate predictions, it is possible to significantly cut down on both instance size (the length of preference lists) as well as the number of proposals made. These results explain the practical success of the DA algorithm and connect market design to the emerging theory of algorithms with predictions.</description>

      <title>Deciding Reachability and the Covering Problem with Diagnostics for Sound Acyclic Free-Choice Workflow Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central decision problem in Petri net theory is reachability asking whether a given marking can be reached from the initial marking. Related is the covering problem (or sub-marking reachbility), which decides whether there is a reachable marking covering at least the tokens in the given marking. For live and bounded free-choice nets as well as for sound free-choice workflow nets, both problems are polynomial in their computational complexity. This paper refines this complexity for the class of sound acyclic free-choice workflow nets to a quadratic polynomial, more specifically to $O(P^2 + T^2)$. Furthermore, this paper shows the feasibility of accurately explaining why a given marking is or is not reachable. This can be achieved by three new concepts: admissibility, maximum admissibility, and diverging transitions. Admissibility requires that all places in a given marking are pairwise concurrent. Maximum admissibility states that adding a marked place to an admissible marking would make it inadmissible. A diverging transition is a transition which originally "produces" the concurrent tokens that lead to a given marking. In this paper, we provide algorithms for all these concepts and explain their computation in detail by basing them on the concepts of concurrency and post-dominance frontiers - a well known concept from compiler construction. In doing this, we present straight-forward implementations for solving (sub-marking) reachability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in the Erd{\"o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm - revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices - finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open - one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ whp. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges, not yet "seen" by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we also prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem, by supporting the conjectured optimality of the greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are inherently unstable, necessitating new ideas. Our proof refines the OGP framework by incorporating several new ideas (including temporal interpolation paths and stopping-times) that we expect to be useful for other online models.</description>

      <title>An Approximation Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Cost Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the minimum submodular cost allocation (MSCA) problem. The input of MSCA is $k$ non-negative submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_k$ on the ground set $N$ given by evaluation oracles, and the goal is to partition $N$ into $k$ (possibly empty) sets $S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ so that $\sum_{i=1}^k f_i(S_i)$ is minimized. In this paper, we focus on the case when $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_k$ are monotone, which coincides with the submodular facility location problem considered by Svitkina and Tardos. We show that the integrality gap of a natural LP-relaxation for MSCA with monotone submodular functions is at most $k/2$, yielding a $k/2$-approximation algorithm. We also prove a nearly matching lower bound: the integrality gap is at least $k/2-\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ when $k$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>Expected Cost of Greedy Online Facility Assignment on Regular Polygons (v3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a greedy online facility assignment process on a regular $n$-gon, where unit-capacity facilities occupy the vertices and customers arrive sequentially at uniformly random locations on polygon edges. Each arrival is irrevocably assigned to the nearest currently free facility under the shortest edge-walk metric, with uniform tie-breaking among equidistant choices. Our main theoretical result is an exact value-function characterization: for every occupancy state $S\subseteq V$, the expected remaining cost $V(S)$ satisfies a finite-horizon integral recurrence obtained by conditioning on the random arrival edge and position. To make this recurrence computationally effective, we exploit dihedral symmetry of the regular polygon and show that $V(S)$ is invariant under rotations and reflections, enabling canonicalization and symmetry-reduced dynamic programming. For small $n$, we evaluate the recurrence accurately using deterministic numerical integration over piecewise-linear distance regions,; for larger $n$, we estimate the expected total cost via direct Monte Carlo simulation of the online process and report $95\%$ confidence intervals. Our computations validate the recurrence (including a closed-form check for the square, $n=4$) and indicate that the total expected cost increases with $n$, while the per-customer expected travel distance grows gradually as remaining free vertices become farther on average. \keywords{Online algorithms \and Facility assignment \and Expected cost \and Regular polygons \and Symmetry reduction \and Monte Carlo}</description>

      <title>Nested and outlier embeddings into trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider outlier embeddings into HSTs. In particular, for metric $(X,d)$, let $k$ be the size of the smallest subset of $X$ such that all but that subset (the ``outlier set'') can be probabilistically embedded into the space of HSTs with expected distortion at most $c$. Our primary result is showing that there exists an efficient algorithm that takes in $(X,d)$ and a target distortion $c$ and samples from a probabilistic embedding with at most $O(\frac k \epsilon \log^2k)$ outliers and distortion at most $(32+\epsilon)c$, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. In order to facilitate our results, we show how to find good nested embeddings into HSTs and combine this with an approximation algorithm of Munagala et al. [MST23] to obtain our results.</description>

Abstract: Can we make a denial-of-service attacker pay more than the server and honest clients? Consider a model where a server sees a stream of jobs sent by either honest clients or an adversary. The server sets a price for servicing each job with the aid of an estimator, which provides approximate statistical information about the distribution of previously occurring good jobs.
  We describe and analyze pricing algorithms for the server under different models of synchrony, with total cost parameterized by the accuracy of the estimator. Given a reasonably accurate estimator, the algorithm's cost provably grows more slowly than the attacker's cost, as the attacker's cost grows large. Additionally, we prove a lower bound, showing that our pricing algorithm yields asymptotically tight results when the estimator is accurate within constant factors.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Fast and Correct Computation of Reeb Spaces for PL Bivariate Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reeb space is a fundamental data structure in computational topology that represents the fiber topology of a multi-field (or multiple scalar fields), extending the level set topology of a scalar field. Efficient algorithms have been designed for computing Reeb graphs, however, computing correct Reeb spaces for PL bivariate fields, is a challenging open problem. There are only a few implementable algorithms in the literature for computing Reeb space or its approximation, via range quantization or by computing a Jacobi fiber surface, which are computationally expensive or have correctness issues, i.e., the computed Reeb space may not be topologically equivalent or homeomorphic to the actual Reeb space. In the current paper, we propose a novel algorithm for fast and correct computation of the Reeb space corresponding to a generic PL bivariate field defined on a triangulation $\mathbb{M}$ of a $3$-manifold without boundary, leveraging the fast algorithms for computing Reeb graphs in the literature.
  Our algorithm is based on the computation of a Multi-Dimensional Reeb Graph (MDRG) which is first proved to be homeomorphic with the Reeb space. For the correct computation of the MDRG, we compute the Jacobi set of the PL bivariate field and its projection into the Reeb space, called the Jacobi structure. Finally, the correct Reeb space is obtained by computing a net-like structure embedded in the Reeb space and then computing its $2$-sheets in the net-like structure. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^2 + n\, c_{int}\, \log n + nc_L^2)$, where $n$ is the total number of simplices in $\mathbb{M}$, $c_{int}$ is the number of intersection points of the projections of the non-adjacent Jacobi set edges on the range of the bivariate field and $c_L$ is the upper bound on the number of simplices in the link of an edge of $\mathbb{M}$.</description>

      <title>On Densest $k$-Subgraph Mining and Diagonal Loading: Optimization Landscape and Finite-Step Exact Convergence Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) is a fundamental combinatorial problem known for its theoretical hardness and breadth of applications. Recently, Lu et al. (AAAI 2025) introduced a penalty-based non-convex relaxation that achieves promising empirical performance; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its success remains unclear. In this work, we bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis. We first establish the tightness of the relaxation, ensuring that the global maximum values of the original combinatorial problem and the relaxed problem coincide. Then we reveal the benign geometry of the optimization landscape by proving a strict dichotomy of stationary points: all integral stationary points are local maximizers, whereas all non-integral stationary points are strict saddles with explicit positive curvature. We propose a saddle-escaping Frank--Wolfe algorithm and prove that it achieves exact convergence to an integral local maximizer in a finite number of steps.</description>

      <title>A New Quantum Linear System Algorithm Beyond the Condition Number and Its Application to Solving Multivariate Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix $A$ of dimension $M \times N$ and a vector $\vec{b}$, the quantum linear system (QLS) problem asks for the preparation of a quantum state $|\vec{y}\rangle$ proportional to the solution of $A\vec{y} = \vec{b}$. Existing QLS algorithms have runtimes that scale linearly with the condition number $\kappa(A)$, the sparsity of $A$, and logarithmically with inverse precision, but often overlook structural properties of $\vec{b}$, whose alignment with $A$'s eigenspaces can greatly affect performance.
  In this work, we present a new QLS algorithm that explicitly leverages the structure of the right-hand side vector $\vec{b}$. The runtime of our algorithm depends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A, -\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \[ ET= \sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2 \cdot d_i, \] where $\vec{p} = (AA^{\top})^+ \vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the squared $\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$. We also introduce a structure-aware rescaling technique tailored to the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$. Unlike left preconditioning methods, which transform the linear system to $DA\vec{y} = D\vec{b}$, our approach applies a right rescaling matrix, reformulating the linear system as $AD\vec{z} = \vec{b}$.
  As an application of our instance-aware QLS algorithm and new rescaling scheme, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial systems in regimes where prior QLS-based methods fail. This yields an end-to-end framework applicable to a broad class of problems. In particular, we apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, formulated as a special case of a polynomial system, and show through detailed analysis that, under certain conditions, our quantum algorithm for MIS runs in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>On Purely Private Covariance Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of \cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n&lt; d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$, improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private} and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of \cite{dong2022differentially}.</description>

      <title>The Query Complexity of Local Search in Rounds on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the query complexity of finding a local minimum in $t$ rounds on general graphs. More precisely, given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and oracle access to an unknown function $f : V \to \mathbb{R}$, the goal is to find a local minimum--a vertex $v$ such that $f(v) \leq f(u)$ for all $(u,v) \in E$--using at most $t$ rounds of interaction with the oracle. The query complexity is well understood on grids, but much less is known beyond. This abstract problem captures many optimization tasks, such as finding a local minimum of a loss function during neural network training.
  For each graph with $n$ vertices, we prove a deterministic upper bound of $O(t n^{1/t} (s\Delta)^{1-1/t})$, where $s$ is the separation number and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We complement this result with a randomized lower bound of $\Omega(t n^{1/t}-t)$ that holds for any connected graph. We also find that parallel steepest descent with a warm start provides improved bounds for graphs with high separation number and bounded degree.
  To obtain our results, we utilized an advanced version of Gemini at various stages of our research. We discuss our experience in a methodology section.</description>
