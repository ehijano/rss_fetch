      <title>On the Rigidity of the Roots of Power Series with Constrained Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we consider the set $\Sigma_S$ of roots of power series whose coefficients lie in a given set $S$ and how such sets of roots vary as the set $S$ varies. We give an estimate of the depth that complex roots can reach into the disc, offer some criterion for the set of roots to be connected or disconnected, and show that for two finite symmetric sets $S$ and $T$ of integers containing $1$, if $\Sigma_S = \Sigma_T$ then all of their elements between $1$ and $2\sqrt{\max(S)}+1$ must agree.</description>

      <title>Pancreatic $\beta-$Cell Dynamics with Three-Time-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pancreatic $\beta-$cells regulate insulin secretion through complex oscillations, which are vital for glucose control and diabetes research. In this paper, an existing mathematical model of $\beta-$cell dynamics is analyzed using a three-time-scale framework to study interactions among fast, intermediate, and slow variables. Through Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT), the influence of ATP on oscillatory dynamics via membrane potential is explored. At the non-hyperbolic point, where standard methods fail, blow-up analysis is applied to investigate canard dynamics shaped by intermediate and slow variables. Numerical simulations with varied parameters reveal the glucose-dependent oscillations linked to slow dynamics near the pseudo-singular points. By leveraging the pseudo-singular point, the linger time is defined, and simulated results for the coupling strength needed for bursting initiation synchronization are presented as a sufficient condition. This study links mathematics and biology, offering insights into diabetic studies.</description>

      <title>Fractal Attractors in Random Nonlinear Iterated Function Systems: Existence, Stability, and Dimensional Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework for Random Nonlinear Iterated Function Systems (RNIFS), a generalization of classical IFS models that incorporates both nonlinearity and stochasticity. We establish mathematical guarantees for the existence and stability of invariant fractal attractors by leveraging contractivity conditions, Lyapunov-type criteria, and measure-theoretic arguments. Empirically, we design a set of high-resolution simulations across diverse nonlinear functions and probabilistic schemes to analyze the emergent attractors geometry and dimensionality. A box-counting method is used to estimate the fractal dimension, revealing attractors with rich internal structure and dimensions ranging from 1.4 to 1.89. Additionally, we present a case study comparing RNIFS to the classical Sierpi\'nski triangle, demonstrating the generalization's ability to preserve global shape while enhancing geometric complexity. These findings affirm the capacity of RNIFS to model intricate, self-similar structures beyond the reach of traditional deterministic systems, offering new directions for the study of random fractals in both theory and applications.</description>

      <title>Limit distributions for $\text{SO}(n,1)$ action on $k$-lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of norm ball averages along orbits of a lattice $\Gamma \subset \text{SO}(n,1)$ acting on the moduli space of pairs of orthogonal discrete subgroups of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ up to homothety. Our main result shows that, except for special $2$-lattices in $\mathbb{R}^3$ lying in hyperplanes tangent to the light cone, these measures converge to an explicit semi-invariant probability measure supported on the space of homothety classes of pairs of orthogonal lattices tangent to the light cone.
  Our main motivation is a conjecture of Sargent and Shapira, which is resolved as a special case of our general result.</description>

      <title>Numerical Periodic Normalization at Codim 1 Bifurcations of Limit Cycles in DDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in [53, 54] by the authors on periodic center manifolds and normal forms for bifurcations of limit cycles in delay differential equations (DDEs) motivates the derivation of explicit computational formulas for the critical normal form coefficients of all codimension one bifurcations of limit cycles. In this paper, we derive such formulas via an application of the periodic normalization method in combination with the functional analytic perturbation framework for dual semigroups (sun-star calculus). The explicit formulas allow us to distinguish between nondegenerate, sub- and supercritical bifurcations. To efficiently apply these formulas, we introduce the characteristic operator as this enables us to use robust numerical boundary-value algorithms based on orthogonal collocation. Although our theoretical results are proven in a more general setting, the software implementation and examples focus on discrete DDEs. The actual implementation is described in detail and its effectiveness is demonstrated on various models.</description>

      <title>The Kinetic Limit of Balanced Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Balanced Neural Networks is a very popular explanation for the high degree of variability and stochasticity in the brain's activity. Roughly speaking, it entails that typical neurons receive many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The network-wide mean inputs cancel, and one is left with the stochastic fluctuations about the mean. In this paper we determine kinetic equations that describe the population density. The intrinsic dynamics is nonlinear, with multiplicative noise perturbing the state of each neuron. The equations have a spatial dimension, such that the strength-of-connection between neurons is a function of their spatial position. Our method of proof is to decompose the state variables into (i) the network-wide average activity, and (ii) fluctuations about this mean. In the limit, we determine two coupled limiting equations. The requirement that the system be balanced yields implicit equations for the evolution of the average activity. In the large n limit, the population density of the fluctuations evolves according to a Fokker-Planck equation. If one makes an additional assumption that the intrinsic dynamics is linear and the noise is not multiplicative, then one obtains a spatially-distributed neural field equation.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Evolution Operator Learning for High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an encoder-only approach to learn the evolution operators of large-scale non-linear dynamical systems, such as those describing complex natural phenomena. Evolution operators are particularly well-suited for analyzing systems that exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns and have become a key analytical tool across various scientific communities. As terabyte-scale weather datasets and simulation tools capable of running millions of molecular dynamics steps per day are becoming commodities, our approach provides an effective tool to make sense of them from a data-driven perspective. The core of it lies in a remarkable connection between self-supervised representation learning methods and the recently established learning theory of evolution operators. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we test it across multiple scientific domains: explaining the folding dynamics of small proteins, the binding process of drug-like molecules in host sites, and autonomously finding patterns in climate data. Code and data to reproduce the experiments are made available open source.</description>

      <title>Discrete gradient methods for port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete gradient methods are a powerful tool for the time discretization of dynamical systems, since they are structure-preserving regardless of the form of the total energy. In this work, we discuss the application of discrete gradient methods to the system class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations - as they emerge from the port- and energy-based modeling of physical systems in various domains. We introduce a novel numerical scheme tailored for semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations and further address more general settings using the concepts of discrete gradient pairs and Dirac-dissipative structures. Additionally, the behavior under system transformations is investigated and we demonstrate that under suitable assumptions port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations admit a representation which consists of a parametrized port-Hamiltonian semi-explicit system and an unstructured equation. Finally, we present the application to multibody system dynamics and discuss numerical results to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced with fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue to be a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing in some cases. We test our results numerically in a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and discuss the limits of the chaotic Kramers' law as well as its surprisingly wide parameter range of applicability. Hereby, we show in detail how to apply Hasselmann's program in practice and give a possible explanation for recent findings of AMOC collapse and recovery in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian description of the nonholonomic Suslov problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present some new Poisson bivectors that are invariants by the flow of the nonholonomic Suslov problem. Two rank four invariant Poisson bivectors have globally defined Casimir functions and, therefore, define cubic Poisson brackets on the five dimensional state space with standard symplectic leaves. For the Suslov gyrostat in the potential field we found rank two Poisson bivectors having only two globally defined Casimir functions and, therefore, we say about formal Hamiltonian description in these cases.</description>

Abstract: In this article we revisit the notion of \textit{Some Hyperbolicity} introduced by Pujals and Sambarino in \cite{PuSa}. We present a more general definition, that in particular can be applied to the symplectic context (something that the previous couldn't). As an application we construct $C^1$ robustly transitive derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms with mixed behaviour on center leaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct examples illustrating that dynamically-defined distributions of holomorphic diffeomorphisms on compact complex manifolds are not necessarily holomorphic in any open subset. More precisely, for any $n\geq 5$, we construct a holomorphic fibered partially hyperbolic system on a complex $n$-fold, where the center distribution is not holomorphic in any open subset. For $n=3$ we demonstrate a contrast: the center distribution of any fibered holomorphic partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on a complex $3$-fold is holomorphic. In particular, any such a system is a holomorphic skew product over a linear automorphism on a complex $2$-torus.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow, as shown by Sullivan and Otal-Peign\'e respectively. Moreover, it is strongly mixing by a result of Babillot. We obtain a higher-rank analogue of this theorem. Given a relatively Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group, there is a family of flow spaces parameterized by linear forms tangent to the growth indicator. We construct a reparameterization of each flow space by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning space of $\Gamma$ which exhibits exponential expansion along unstable foliations. Using this reparameterization, we prove that the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure of each flow space is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy. Moreover, it is strongly mixing.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth closed oriented surface. Gaussian thermostats on $M$ correspond to the geodesic flows arising from metric connections, including those with non-zero torsion. These flows may not preserve any absolutely continuous measure. We prove that if two Gaussian thermostats on $M$ with negative thermostat curvature are related by a smooth orbit equivalence isotopic to the identity, then the two background metrics are conformally equivalent via a smooth diffeomorphism of $M$ isotopic to the identity. We also give a relationship between the thermostat forms themselves. Finally, we prove the same result for Anosov magnetic flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of symmetries into the Koopman-operator framework for the analysis and efficient learning of equivariant dynamical systems using a group-convolutional approach. Approximating the Koopman operator by finite-dimensional surrogates, e.g., via extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), is challenging for high-dimensional systems due to computational constraints. To tackle this problem with a particular focus on EDMD, we demonstrate -- under suitable equivarance assumptions on the system and the observables -- that the optimal EDMD matrix is equivariant. That is, its action on states can be described by group convolutions and the generalized Fourier transform. We show that this structural property has many advantages for equivariant systems, in particular, that it allows for data-efficient learning, fast predictions and fast eigenfunction approximations. We conduct numerical experiments on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and a $\lambda$-$\omega$ spiraling wave system, both nonlinear partial differential equations, providing evidence of the effectiveness of this approach, and highlighting its potential for broader applications in dynamical systems analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep diagonal map $T_k$ acts on planar polygons by connecting the $k$-th diagonals and intersecting them successively. The map $T_2$ is the pentagram map, and $T_k$ is a generalization. We study the action of $T_k$ on two subsets of the so-called twisted polygons, which we term type-$\alpha$ and type-$\beta$ $k$-spirals. For $k \geq 2$, $T_{k}$ preserves both types of $k$-spirals. In particular, we show that for $k = 2$ and $k = 3$, both types of $k$-spirals have precompact forward and backward $T_k$-orbits modulo projective transformations. We derive a rational formula for $T_3$, which generalizes the $y$-variables transformation formula by M. Glick and P. Pylyavskyy. We also present four algebraic invariants of $T_3$. These special orbits in the moduli space are partitioned into cells of a $3 \times 3$ tic-tac-toe grid. This establishes the action of $T_k$ on $k$-spirals as a geometric generalization of $T_2$ on convex polygons.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Koopman Semigroup Estimation in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SDMD), a novel data-driven framework for approximating the Koopman semigroup in stochastic dynamical systems. Unlike existing methods, SDMD explicitly incorporates sampling time into its approximation, ensuring numerical stability and precision. By directly approximating the Koopman semigroup instead of the generator, SDMD avoids computationally expensive matrix exponential computations, which offers a more efficient and practical pathway for analyzing stochastic dynamics. The framework further integrates neural networks to automate basis selection, which reduces the reliance on manual intervention while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous theoretical guarantees, including convergence in the large data limit, zero-limit of sampling time, and large dictionary size, establish the method's reliability. Numerical experiments on canonical stochastic systems validate SDMD's effectiveness in approximating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the stochastic Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional strata of residueless meromorphic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In projectivized strata of meromorphic $1$-forms on elliptic curves with only one zero, the locus of residueless differentials is a complex curve endowed with a canonical complex projective structure. Drawing on the multi-scale compactification of strata, we provide formulas to compute the genus of these curves and the degree of their natural forgetful map to $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$. Additionally, we distinguish two non-hyperelliptic components in the residueless locus of the exceptional stratum $\mathcal{H}_{1}(12,-3,-3,-3,-3)$ and hence complete the classification of the connected components of these loci.</description>

      <title>Magnetic billiards and the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of disk tangent bundles of lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of disk tangent bundles of certain lens spaces with respect to the round metric. Interestingly we find that the Hofer-Zehnder capacity does not see the covering, i.e. the capacity of the disk tangent bundle of the lens space coincides with the capacity of the disk tangent bundle of the 3-sphere covering it. In particular, this gives a first example, where Gromov width and Hofer-Zehnder capacity of a disk tangent bundle disagree. Techniques we use include for the lower bound magnetic billiards and for the upper bound Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Gradient Flow for Overparameterized LQR Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in control design, this paper analyses the intersection between results from gradient methods for the model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and linear feedforward neural networks (LFFNNs), More specifically, it looks into the case where one wants to find a LFFNN feedback that minimizes a LQR cost. This paper starts by analyzing the structure of the gradient expression for the parameters of each layer, which implies a key conservation law of the system. This conservation law is then leveraged to generalize existing results on boundedness and global convergence of solutions to critical points, and invariance of the set of stabilizing networks under the training dynamics. This is followed by an analysis of the case where the LFFNN has a single hidden layer, for which the paper proves that the training converges not only to the critical points, but to the optimal feedback control law for all but a set of Lebesgue measure zero of the initializations. These theoretical results are followed by an extensive analysis of a simple version of the problem -- the ``vector case'' -- proving the theoretical properties of accelerated convergence and small-input input-to-state stability (ISS) for this simpler example. Finally, the paper presents numerical evidence of faster convergence of the training of general LFFNNs when compared to non-overparameterized formulations, showing that the acceleration of the solution is observable even when the gradient is not explicitly computed, but estimated from evaluations of the cost function.</description>

      <title>Localization for random operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with the long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate random operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with H\"older continuously distributed potentials and the long-range hopping. The hopping amplitude decays with the inter-particle distance $\|\bm x\|$ as $e^{-\log^{\rho}(\|\bm x\|+1)}$ with $\rho&gt;1,\bm x\in\Z^d$. By employing the multi-scale analysis (MSA) technique, we prove that for large disorder, the random operators have pure point spectrum with localized eigenfunctions whose decay rate is the same as the hopping term. This gives a partial answer to a conjecture of Yeung and Oono [{\it Europhys. Lett.} 4(9), (1987): 1061-1065].</description>

      <title>Non-geometric property (T) of warped cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric property (T) for discretized warped cones of an action of finitely generated group $G$ on a compact metric space $M$. We show that if $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and the action is free, measure preserving, ergodic and isometric, then the associated discretized warped cone $\bigsqcup_n M\times \{t(n)\}$ does not have geometric property (T) for any sequence of positive numbers $\{t(n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $\infty$.
  As an application, we obtain new examples of expanders without geometric property (T).</description>

      <title>Energetic consistency and heat transport in Fourier-Galerkin truncations of free slip 3D rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of energetic consistency in Fourier truncated models of the 3D Boussinesq-Coriolis (BC) equations as a case-study towards improving the realism of convective processes in climate models. As a benchmark we consider the Nusselt number, defined as the average vertical heat transport of a convective flow. A set of formulae are derived which give the ODE projection of the BC model onto any finite selection of modes. It is proven that projected ODE models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE if and only if a mode selection Criterion regarding the vertical resolution is satisfied. It is also proven that the energy relations imply the existence of a compact attractor for these ODE's, which then implies bounds on the Nusselt number. By contrast, it is proven that a broad class of energetically inconsistent models admit solutions with unbounded, exponential growth, precluding the existence of a compact attractor and giving an infinite Nusselt number. On the other hand, certain energetically inconsistent models can admit compact attractors as shown via a simple model. The above formulas are implemented in MATLAB, enabling a user to study any desired Fourier truncated model by selecting a desired finite set of Fourier modes. All code is made available on GitHub. Several numerical studies of the Nusselt number are conducted to assess the convergence of the Nusselt number with respect to increasing spatial resolution for consistent models and measure the distorting effects of inconsistency for more general solutions.</description>

      <title>Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic collocation schemes for Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyse numerical schemes for uncertainty quantification in neural field equations subject to random parametric data in the synaptic kernel, firing rate, external stimulus, and initial conditions. The schemes combine a generic projection method for spatial discretisation to a stochastic collocation scheme for the random variables. We study the problem in operator form, and derive estimates for the total error of the schemes, in terms of the spatial projector. We give conditions on the projected random data which guarantee analyticity of the semi-discrete solution as a Banach-valued function. We illustrate how to verify hypotheses starting from analytic random data and a choice of spatial projection. We provide evidence that the predicted convergence rates are found in various numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear neural field problems.</description>
