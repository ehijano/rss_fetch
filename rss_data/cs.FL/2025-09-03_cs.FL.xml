      <title>Store Languages of Turing Machines and Counter Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The store language of an automaton is the set of store configurations (state and store contents, but not the input) that can appear as an intermediate step in an accepting computation. A one-way nondeterministic finite-visit Turing machine (fvNTM) is a Turing machine with a one-way read-only input tape, and a single worktape, where there is some number $k$ such that in every accepting computation, each worktape cell is visited at most $k$ times. We show that the store language of every fvNTM is a regular language. Furthermore, we show that the store language of every fvNTM augmented by reversal-bounded counters can be accepted by a machine with only reversal-bounded counters and no worktape. Several applications are given to problems in the areas of verification and fault tolerance, and to the study of right quotients. We also continue the investigation of the store languages of one-way and two-way machine models where we present some conditions under which their store languages are recursive or non-recursive.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and minimality bounds of quantum and post-quantum models of classical stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.</description>
