      <title>Alz-QNet: A Quantum Regression Network for Studying Alzheimer's Gene Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease (AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge. Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1 ($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$, $FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database $GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions, shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or regulators for theranostics.</description>

      <title>GCnet: Using Granger causality to explore the dynamic causality relations among genes as-sociated with intellectual disability in human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intellectual disability (ID) is defined by an IQ under 70, in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday living. Throughout history, individuals with ID have often been margin-alized from society and continue to suffer significantly even in modern times. A varying proportion of ID cases are attributable to genetic causes. Identifying the causal relation among these ID-associated genes and their gene expression pattern during brain development process would gain us a better understanding of the molecular basis of ID. In this paper, we interpret gene expression data collected at different time points during the in vitro brain development process as time series and further introduce Granger causality test to evaluate the dynamic dependence relations among genes. These evaluations are used as input to construct gene expression network and extract the pathological information associated to ID including identi-fying new genes that can be critically related to the disease. To demonstrate our methods, we pro-vide a priority list of new genes that are most likely associated with Mowat Wilson Syndrome via monitoring the community structure of ZEB2 in our Granger causality network constructed based on the Kutsche dataset (Kutsche, et al., 2018).</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired algorithm for simulating viral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of biological systems is an exciting avenue for applying advanced approaches to solving corresponding computational tasks. A specific class of problems that arises in the resolution of biological challenges is optimization. In this work, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study that applies a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to simulate a viral response. We formulate an Ising-type model to describe the patterns of gene activity in host responses. Reducing the problem to the Ising form allows the use of available quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools. We demonstrate the application of a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to this problem. Our study paves the way for exploring the full potential of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools in biological applications.</description>
