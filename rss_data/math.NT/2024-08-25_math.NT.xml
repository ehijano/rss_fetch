      <title>Murmurations and ratios conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject to GRH, we prove that murmurations arise for primitive quadratic Dirichlet characters, and for holomorphic modular forms of prime level tending to infinity with sign and weight fixed. Moreover, subject to ratios conjectures, we prove that murmurations arise for elliptic curves ordered by height, and for quadratic twists of a fixed elliptic curve. We demonstrate the existence of murmurations for these arithmetic families using results from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>High-distance codes with transversal Clifford and $T$-gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-local interactions in several quantum devices allow for the realization of more compact quantum encodings while retaining the same degree of protection against noise. Anticipating that short to medium-length codes will soon be realizable, it is important to construct stabilizer codes that, for a given code distance, admit fault-tolerant implementations of logical gates with the fewest number of physical qubits. We extract high-distance doubly even codes from the quantum quadratic-residue code family that admit a transversal implementation of the single-qubit Clifford group. Applying a doubling procedure [arXiv:1509.03239] to such codes yields a family of high-distance triply even codes which admit a transversal implementation of the logical $\texttt{T}$-gate. To our knowledge, both code families require a lower qubit overhead than any other qubit stabilizer code of the same distance which can realize their respective gates.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic morphisms, tangential basepoints, and little disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of ``virtual morphisms'' in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology.
  Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</description>

      <title>A tour d'horizon of de Casteljau's work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whilst Paul de Casteljau is now famous for his fundamental algorithm of curve and surface approximation, little is known about his other findings. This article offers an insight into his results in geometry, algebra and number theory.
  Related to geometry, his classical algorithm is reviewed as an index reduction of a polar form. This idea is used to show de Casteljau's algebraic way of smoothing, which long went unnoticed. We will also see an analytic polar form and its use in finding the intersection of two curves. The article summarises unpublished material on metric geometry. It includes theoretical advances, e.g., the 14-point strophoid or a way to link Apollonian circles with confocal conics, and also practical applications such as a recurrence for conjugate mirrors in geometric optics. A view on regular polygons leads to an approximation of their diagonals by golden matrices, a generalisation of the golden ratio.
  Relevant algebraic findings include matrix quaternions (and anti-quaternions) and their link with Lorentz' equations. De Casteljau generalised the Euclidean algorithm and developed an automated method for approximating the roots of a class of polynomial equations. His contributions to number theory not only include aspects on the sum of four squares as in quaternions, but also a view on a particular sum of three cubes. After a review of a complete quadrilateral in a heptagon and its angles, the paper concludes with a summary of de Casteljau's key achievements.
  The article contains a comprehensive bibliography of de Casteljau's works, including previously unpublished material.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solutions of linear differential equations: an arithmetic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a linear differential equation with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(x)$, an important question is to know whether its full space of solutions consists of algebraic functions, or at least if one of its specific solutions is algebraic. After presenting motivating examples coming from various branches of mathematics, we advertise in an elementary way a beautiful local-global arithmetic approach to these questions, initiated by Grothendieck in the late sixties. This approach has deep ramifications and leads to the still unsolved Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture.</description>

      <title>On C-Algebraic and C-Arithmetic Automorphic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the article, we consider the conjecture of K. Buzzard and T. Gee proposing that every C-algebraic automorphic representation is C-arithmetic, and we show that it can be reduced to the the analogous statement for cuspidal C-algebraic automorphic representations. We also show that if every cuspidal C-algebraic automorphic representations is C-arithmetic, then every L-algebraic automorphic representation is L-arithmetic. In the second part, we restrict to the simpler setting of anisotropic groups. We prove a criterion which shows that, under certain conditions, the trace formula can be used to establish that an automorphic representation is C-arithmetic. This criterion does not require the existence of a geometric model for the non-Archimedean part of the representation: it only depends on the possibility of isolating a finite family of automorphic representations containing the given one, and on a certain arithmetic condition on the Archimedean orbital integrals. As an application, we give a new proof that regular discrete series are C-arithmetic.</description>

      <title>On Erd\H{o}s covering systems in global function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A covering system of the integers is a finite collection of arithmetic progressions whose union is the set of integers. A well-known problem on covering systems is the minimum modulus problem posed by Erd\H{o}s in 1950, who asked whether the minimum modulus in such systems with distinct moduli can be arbitrarily large. This problem was resolved by Hough in 2015, who showed that the minimum modulus is at most $10^{16}$. In 2022, Balister, Bollob\'as, Morris, Sahasrabudhe and Tiba reduced Hough's bound to $616,000$ by developing Hough's method. They call it the distortion method. In this paper, by applying this method, we mainly prove that there does not exist any covering system of multiplicity $s$ in any global function field of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for $q\geq (1.14+0.16g)e^{6.5+0.97g}s^2$. In particular, there is no covering system of $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ with distinct moduli for $q\geq 759$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a totally real field and $\{\rho_{\pi,\lambda}:\mathrm{Gal}_K\to\mathrm{GL}_n(\overline E_\lambda)\}_\lambda$ the strictly compatible system of $K$ defined over $E$ attached to a regular algebraic polarized cuspidal automorphic representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb A_K)$. Let $\mathbf G_\lambda$ be the algebraic monodromy group of $\rho_{\pi,\lambda}$. If there exists $\lambda_0$ such that (a) $\rho_{\pi,\lambda_0}$ is irreducible, (b) $\mathbf G_{\lambda_0}$ is connected and of type $A_1$, and (c) either at most one basic factor in the exterior tensor decomposition of the tautological representation of $\mathbf G_{\lambda_0}^{\mathrm{der}}$ is $(\mathrm{SL}_2,\mathrm{std})$ or the tautological representation of $\mathbf G_{\lambda_0}^{\mathrm{der}}$ is $(\mathrm{SO}_4,\mathrm{std})$, we prove that $\mathbf G_{\lambda,\mathbb C}\subset\mathrm{GL}_{n, \mathbb C}$ is independent of $\lambda$, $\rho_{\pi,\lambda}$ is irreducible for all $\lambda$ and residually irreducible for almost all $\lambda$. If moreover $K=\mathbb Q$, we prove that the compatible system $\{\rho_{\pi,\lambda}\}_\lambda$ is up to twist constructed from some two-dimensional modular compatible systems.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the dual fine Selmer group of an abelian variety over the unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extension of a function field is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This is a function field version of a conjecture of Coates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite (respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety is finite (respectively zero).</description>

      <title>On the maximum size of ultrametric orthogonal sets over discrete valued fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a discrete valued field with finite residue field. In analogy with orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a well-studied notion of "ultrametric orthogonality" in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, motivated by a question of Erd{\H{o}}s in the real case, given integers $k \geq \ell \geq 2$, we investigate the maximum size of a subset $S \subseteq \mathcal{K}^n \setminus\{{\bf 0}\}$ satisfying the following property: for any $E \subseteq S$ of size $k$, there exists $F \subseteq E$ of size $\ell$ such that any two distinct vectors in $F$ are orthogonal. Other variants of this property are also studied.</description>

Abstract: Let $n&gt;1$ be a positive integer. Let $R$ be a henselian local ring with residue field $k$ of $n$th level $s_n(k)$. We give some upper and lower bounds for the $n$th Waring number $w_n(R)$ in terms of $w_n(k)$ and $s_n(k)$. In large number of cases we are able to compute $w_n(R)$. Similar results for the $n$th Waring number of the total ring of fractions of $R$ are obtained. We then provide applications. In particular we compute $w_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ and $w_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for $n\in\{3,4,5\}$ and any prime $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural geometric framework for the study of logarithmically divergent integrals on manifolds with corners and algebraic varieties, using the techniques of logarithmic geometry. Key to the construction is a new notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry itself, introduced by Howell, which allows us to interpret the ubiquitous rule of thumb ``$\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \log \epsilon := 0$'' as the restriction to a submanifold. Via a version of de Rham's theorem with logarithmic divergences, we obtain a functorial characterization of the classical theory of ``regularized integration'': it is the unique way to extend the ordinary integral to the logarithmically divergent context while respecting the basic laws of calculus (change of variables, Fubini's theorem, and Stokes' formula.)</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces and alternating multiple zetas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show for every sufficiently large integer $g$ the existence of a complete family of closed and embedded constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces deforming the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ parametrized by their conformal type. When specializing to the minimal case, we discover a pattern resulting in the coefficients of the involved expansions being alternating multiple zeta values (MZVs), which generalizes the notion of Riemann's zeta values to multiple integer variables. This allows us to extend a new existence proof of the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ to all $g\geq 3$ using complex analytic methods and to give closed form expressions of their area expansion up to order $7$. For example, the third order coefficient is $\tfrac{9}{4}\zeta(3)$ (the first and second order term were shown to be $\log(2)$ and $0$ respectively in \cite{HHT}). As a corollary, we obtain that the area of $\xi_{1,g}$ is monotonically increasing in their genus $g$ for all $g\geq 0.$</description>
