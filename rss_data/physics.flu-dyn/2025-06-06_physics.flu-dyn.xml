      <title>Linear instability of plane Couette and Poiseuille flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that linear instability of plane Couette flow can take place even at finite Reynolds numbers which meets with known experimental data. This new result of the linear theory of hydrodynamic stability is obtained only due by abandoning traditional assumption of the longitudinal periodicity of disturbances in the flow direction.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation of particulate suspensions under stagnant conditions in horizontal pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sedimentation of particulate suspensions in horizontal pipes can lead to formation, growth and consolidation of a solid-like bed which can severely retard pipeline performance. As stagnant flow conditions frequently arise during industrial processes, critical operational questions are: (i) at what rate and extent does sedimentation proceed, and (ii) can the sedimentation dynamics be predicted from conventional suspension characterisation methods? We address these questions by characterising the sedimentation properties of an aqueous Kaolin suspension via batch settling tests and comparing predictions from 1D sedimentation theory with experiments in a horizontally oriented cylindrical pipe. We show that particulate sedimentation can be accurately predicted, indicating that the estimated sedimentation properties are representative material properties, and that transient effects such as gravity currents are not significant. Conversely, we find that the consolidation of the sediment is not well predicted by 1D theory, suggesting that the stress state is not 1D and likely involves contributions from the pipe walls. These stagnant cylindrical pipe results provide a basis for the development of methods to predict pipeline sedimentation under more general (laminar and turbulent) flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Exacerbation of viscoelastic instability due to viscous heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability analysis of the pressure-driven flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid through a plane channel is performed to examine the effects of viscous heating-induced buoyancy on the ``purely elastic instability" predicted by \citet{khalid2021continuous} (Phys. Rev. Lett., 2021, 127, 134502). We do not impose any external heating; rather, the temperature increase in the system is solely due to the viscous heating generated by the flow of a highly viscous fluid, which induces buoyancy. This buoyancy effect adds an extra term to the momentum equation, proportional to the ratio of the Grashof and Reynolds numbers. Since the elastic instability manifests at very low Reynolds numbers, this buoyancy term is crucial for determining flow stability. Our analysis indicates a significant decrease in the critical Weissenberg number due to the viscous heating-induced buoyancy effect, implying that the elastic instability could potentially be observed experimentally at a significantly lower Weissenberg number than that predicted by Khalid et al. (2021b). The asymmetry in the streamwise velocity eigenfunctions, resulting from the presence of viscous heating, is found to be the mechanism behind the predicted destabilizing effect.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and stability of neural operators for prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence poses challenges for numerical simulation due to its chaotic, multiscale nature and high computational cost. Traditional turbulence modeling often struggles with accuracy and long-term stability. Recent scientific machine learning (SciML) models, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), show promise in solving PDEs, but are typically limited to one-step-ahead predictions and often fail over long time horizons, especially in 3D turbulence. This study proposes a framework to assess the reliability of neural operator models in turbulent flows. Using three-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) as a benchmark, we evaluate models in terms of uncertainty quantification (UQ), error propagation, and sensitivity to initial perturbations. Statistical tools such as error distribution analysis and autocorrelation functions (ACF) are used to assess predictive robustness and temporal coherence. Our proposed model, the factorized-implicit FNO (F-IFNO), improves long-term stability and accuracy by incorporating implicit factorization into the prediction process. It outperforms conventional LES and other FNO-based models in balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of prediction constraints, time interval selection, and UQ in developing robust neural operator frameworks for turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of lower floating-point precision on scale-resolving numerical simulations of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computing clusters offer specialized hardware for reduced-precision arithmetic that can speed up the time to solution significantly. This is possible due to a decrease in data movement, as well as the ability to perform arithmetic operations at a faster rate. However, for high-fidelity simulations of turbulence, such as direct and large-eddy simulation, the impact of reduced precision on the computed solution and the resulting uncertainty across flow solvers and different flow cases have not been explored in detail and limits the optimal utilization of new high-performance computing systems. In this work, the effect of reduced precision is studied using four diverse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers (two incompressible, Neko and Simson, and two compressible, PadeLibs and SSDC) using four test cases: turbulent channel flow at Retau = 550 and higher, forced transition in a channel, flow over a cylinder at ReD = 3900, and compressible flow over a wing section at Rec = 50000. We observe that the flow physics are remarkably robust with respect to reduction in lower floating-point precision, and that often other forms of uncertainty, due to for example time averaging, often have a much larger impact on the computed result. Our results indicate that different terms in the Navier-Stokes equations can be computed to a lower floating-point accuracy without affecting the results. In particular, standard IEEE single precision can be used effectively for the entirety of the simulation, showing no significant discrepancies from double-precision results across the solvers and cases considered. Potential pitfalls are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Very high-order accurate finite volume scheme for the streamfunction-vorticity formulation of incompressible fluid flows with polygonal meshes on arbitrary curved boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional mathematical models for simulating incompressible fluid flow problems are based on the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in terms of pressure and velocity. In this context, pressure-velocity coupling is a key issue, and countless numerical techniques and methods have been developed over the decades to solve these equations efficiently and accurately. In two dimensions, an alternative approach is to rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations regarding two scalar quantities: the streamfunction and the vorticity. Compared to the primitive variables approach, this formulation does not require pressure to be computed, thereby avoiding the inherent difficulties associated with the pressure-velocity coupling. However, deriving boundary conditions for the streamfunction and vorticity is challenging. This work proposes an efficient, high-order accurate finite-volume discretisation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the streamfunction-vorticity formulation. A detailed discussion is devoted to deriving the appropriate boundary conditions and their numerical treatment, including on arbitrary curved boundaries. The reconstruction for off-site data method is employed to avoid the difficulties associated with generating curved meshes to preserve high-orders of convergence in arbitrary curved domains, such as sophisticated meshing algorithms, cumbersome quadrature rules, and intricate non-linear transformations. This method approximates arbitrary curved boundaries with a conventional linear piecewise approximation, while constrained polynomial reconstructions near the boundary fulfil the prescribed conditions at the physical boundary. Several incompressible fluid flow test cases in non-trivial 2D curved domains are presented and discussed to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving very high orders of convergence.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Outflow Boundary Influence on Aerodynamic Performance using Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of outflow boundary conditions remains a critical challenge in computational fluid dynamics when predicting aerodynamic forces and/or acoustic emissions. This is particularly evident when employing the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as the numerical solution technique, which often suffers from inaccuracies induced by artificial reflections from outflow boundaries. This paper investigates the use of neural networks (NN) to mitigate these adverse boundary effects and enable truncated domain requirements. Two distinct NN-based approaches are proposed: (1) direct reconstruction of unknown particle distribution functions at the outflow boundary; and (2) enhancement of established characteristic boundary conditions (CBC) by dynamically tuning their parameters. The direct reconstruction model was trained on data generated from a 2D flow over a cylindrical obstruction. The drag, lift, and Strouhal number were used to test the new boundary condition. We analyzed results for various Reynolds numbers and restricted domain sizes where it demonstrated significantly improved predictions when compared with the traditional Zou &amp; He boundary condition. To examine the robustness of the NN-based reconstruction, the same condition was applied to the simulation of a NACA0012 airfoil, again providing accurate aerodynamic performance predictions. The neural-enhanced CBC were evaluated on a 2D convected vortex benchmark and showed superior performance in minimizing density errors compared to CBCs with fixed parameters. These findings highlight the potential of NN-integrated boundary conditions to improve accuracy and reduce computational expense of aerodynamic and acoustic emissions simulations with the LBM.</description>

      <title>Sparse data assimilation for under-resolved large-eddy simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work.
  The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data. Working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, a stationary corrective force in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. After data assimilation, corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses are inferred from the stationary corrective force. Ultimately, this corrective force that acts on the mean velocity is replaced by a term that scales the velocity fluctuations through nudging of the corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses.
  Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature.
  Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i.e., Strouhal number), and anisotropic Reynolds stresses. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical relevance of periodic orbits under increasing Reynolds number and connections to inviscid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large numbers of relative periodic orbits (RPOs) have been found recently in doubly-periodic, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow at moderate Reynolds numbers $Re \in \{40, 100\}$. While these solutions lead to robust statistical reconstructions at the $Re$-values where they were obtained, it is unclear how their dynamical importance evolves with increasing $Re$. We perform arclength continuation on this library of solutions to show that large numbers of RPOs quickly become dynamically irrelevant, reaching dissipation values either well above or below those associated with the turbulent attractor at high $Re$. The scaling of the high dissipation RPOs is shown to be consistent with a direct connection to solutions of the unforced Euler equation, and is observed for a wide variety of states beyond the 'unimodal' solutions considered in previous work (Kim &amp; Okamoto, Nonlinearity 28, 2015). On the other hand, the weakly dissipative states have properties indicating a connection to exact solutions of a forced Euler equation. The apparent dynamical irrelevance is associated with poor statistical reconstructions away from the $Re$ values where the RPOs were originally converged. Motivated by the connection to solutions of the Euler equation, we show that many of these states can be well described by exact relative periodic solutions in a system of point vortices. The point vortex RPOs are converged via gradient-based optimisation of a scalar loss function which (1) matches the dynamics of the point vortices to the turbulent vortex cores and (2) insists the point vortex evolution is itself time-periodic.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>Rational constitutive law for the viscous stress tensor in incompressible two-phase flows: Derivation and tests against a 3D benchmark experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the representation of viscous stresses in the one-fluid formulation of the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations, the model on which all computational approaches making use of a fixed mesh to discretize the flow field are grounded. Recognizing that the Navier-Stokes-like equations that are actually solved in these approaches imply a spatial filtering, we show by considering a specific two-dimensional flow configuration that the proper representation of the viscous stress tensor requires the introduction of two distinct viscosity coefficients, owing to the different behaviors of shear and normal stresses in control volumes straddling the interface. Making use of classical results of continuum mechanics for anisotropic fluids, we derive the general form of the constitutive law linking the viscous stress tensor of the two-phase medium to the filtered strain-rate tensor, and take advantage of the findings provided by the above two-dimensional configuration to close the determination of the fluid-dependent coefficients involved. Predictions of the resulting anisotropic model are then assessed and compared with those of available \textit{ad hoc} models against original experimental results obtained in a reference flow in which some parts of the interface are dominated by shear while others are mostly controlled by stretching. The selected configuration corresponds to a viscous buoyancy-driven exchange flow in a closed vertical pipe, generated by unstably superimposing two immiscible fluids with a large viscosity contrast and negligible interfacial tension and molecular diffusivity. \textcolor{black}{Using different levels of grid refinement}, we show that the anisotropic model is the only one capable of predicting correctly the evolution of the front of the ascending and descending fingers \textcolor{black}{at a reasonable computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sloshing eigenvalues are studied for containers with porous baffles extending throughout the constant (possibly infinite) depth. The fluid transmission across the baffles is described by Darcy's law, and so the spectral problem is nonself-adjoint. In particular, much attention is paid to vertical cylinders with circular walls and radial baffles. Explicit solutions are obtained, whose crucial feature is that the corresponding pressure difference vanishes across the baffle. These real solutions coincide with those that describe sloshing in the presence of rigid baffles, thus demonstrating that at certain frequencies the damping efficiency of porous baffles is the same as that of the rigid ones having the same configuration.</description>

      <title>Temperature and pressure reconstruction in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection by Lagrangian velocities using PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Velocity, pressure, and temperature are the key variables for understanding thermal convection, and measuring them all is a complex task. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to reconstruct temperature and pressure fields based on given Lagrangian velocity data. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on a multilayer perceptron architecture and a periodic sine activation function is used to reconstruct both the temperature and the pressure for two cases of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (Pr = 6.9, Ra = $10^9$). The first dataset is generated with DNS and it includes Lagrangian velocity data of 150000 tracer particles. The second contains a PTV experiment with the same system parameters in a water-filled cubic cell, and we observed about 50000 active particle tracks per time step with the open-source framework proPTV. A realistic temperature and pressure field could be reconstructed in both cases, which underlines the importance of PINNs also in the context of experimental data. In the case of the DNS, the reconstructed temperature and pressure fields show a 90\% correlation over all particles when directly validated against the ground truth. Thus, the proposed method, in combination with particle tracking velocimetry, is able to provide velocity, temperature, and pressure fields in convective flows even in the hard turbulence regime. The PINN used in this paper is compatible with proPTV and is part of an open source project. It is available on request at https://github.com/DLR-AS-BOA.</description>

Abstract: We integrate a discrete vortex method with complex network analysis to strategize dynamic stall mitigation over a pitching airfoil with active flow control. The objective is to inform actuator placement and timing to introduce control inputs during the transient evolution of dynamic stall. To this end, we represent the massively separated flow as a network of discrete vortical elements and quantify the interactions among these vortical nodes by tracking the spread of displacement perturbations between each pair of elements using the discrete vortex method. This enables a network broadcast mode analysis to identify an optimal set of vortices, critical timing, and direction to seed perturbations as control inputs. Motivated by the goal of mitigating dynamic stall, the optimality is defined as minimizing the total circulation of free vortices generated from the leading edge over a prescribed time horizon. We demonstrate the framework on two cases: two-dimensional flow over a flat plate airfoil and three-dimensional turbulent flow over a SD7003 airfoil. The analysis reveals that optimal timing for introducing disturbances occurs just after separation onset, when the shear layer pinches up to form the core of the dynamic stall vortex. Broadcast modes indicate that vortical nodes along the shear layer are optimal for control, guiding actuator placement. Flow simulations validate these insights: placing actuators near the leading edge and triggering them shortly after separation yields a 12% and 30% reduction in peak lift for the flat plate and SD7003 cases, respectively. A corresponding decrease in vorticity injection under control confirms the analysis objective. This study highlights the potential of combining discrete vortex methods with network analysis to guide active flow control in unsteady aerodynamics.</description>
