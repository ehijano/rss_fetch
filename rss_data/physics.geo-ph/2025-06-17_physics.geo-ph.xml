      <title>Smooth surface reconstruction of earthquake faults from distributed potency beachballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake faults approximate smooth surfaces of displacement discontinuity in a coarse-grained linear continuum, and the beachball nodal planes of source inelastic strain (potency) indicate the normal vector (n-vector) of the crack face. This theoretical relation has been used to interpret estimated potency as geometrical information of earthquake faults. We formulate an inverse analysis for reconstructing a smooth, three-dimensional fault surface from a given potency field. The analysis is grounded on the definition of the n-vector that is orthogonality to a surface. It is shown from this definition that, whereas the estimated n-vector field is always explained by a unique curve in two dimensions, the surface reconstruction from the estimated n-vector field is an overdetermined problem with no solution in three dimensions. We resolve this overdetermination by adopting the original definition of a fault surface as a map that approximates a thin sheet of potency onto a displacement discontinuity across a literal face. An analytical expression for this fault reconstruction is derived and confirmed to reproduce the original three-dimensional smooth surface from a synthesized noisy n-vector field. By incorporating this result into surface reconstruction based on potency density tensor inversion, we estimate the three-dimensional source fault geometry of the 2013 Balochistan earthquake. The estimated geometry is more consistent with the fault trace than the quasi-two-dimensional shape reconstruction as anticipated by our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Machine learning approaches for automatic cleaning of investigative drilling data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigative drilling (ID) is an innovative measurement while drilling (MWD) technique that has been implemented in various site investigation projects across Australia. While the automated drilling feature of ID substantially reduces noise within drilling data streams, data cleaning remains essential for removing anomalies to enable accurate strata classification and prediction of soil and rock properties. This study employed three machine learning algorithms--IsoForest, one-class SVM, and DBSCAN--to automate the data cleaning process for ID data in rock drilling scenarios. Two data cleaning contexts were examined: (1) removing anomalies in rock drilling data, and (2) removing both anomalies and soil drilling data in mixed rock drilling data. The analysis revealed that all three machine learning algorithms outperformed traditional statistical methods (the 3-sigma rule and IQR method) in both data cleaning tasks, achieving a good balance between true positive rate and false positive rate, though hyperparameter tuning was required for one-class SVM and DBSCAN. Among them, IsoForest was proven to be the best-performing algorithm, capable of removing anomalies effectively without the need for hyperparameter adjustment. Furthermore, IsoForest, combined with two-cluster K-means, successfully eliminated both soil drilling data and anomalies while preserving almost all the normal data. The automatic data cleaning strategy proposed in this paper has the potential to reduce laborious manual data cleaning efforts and thereby facilitate the development of large-scale, high-quality datasets for machine learning studies capable of revealing complex relationships between drilling data and rock properties.</description>

      <title>SeisCoDE: 3D Seismic Interpretation Foundation Model with Contrastive Self-Distillation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic interpretation is vital for understanding subsurface structures but remains labor-intensive, subjective, and computationally demanding. While deep learning (DL) offers promise, its success hinges on large, high-quality datasets, often scarce in geophysics. Foundation Models (FMs), which have shown significant success in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, offer a transformative opportunity for seismic interpretation by enabling knowledge transfer and generalization across interpretation tasks. However, the application of FMs in this domain remains limited, especially at the 3D scale, due to the absence of a domain-specific pretraining workflow. Here, our study sought to develop a pretraining strategy for 3D seismic interpretation by introducing a vision transformer-based Seismic Contrastive Self-Distillation Encoder (SeisCoDE), a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that leverages seismic signal processing and attribute analysis, preserving seismic structural integrity during pretraining. By leveraging contrastive learning and self-distillation, SeisCoDE learns meaningful latent representations without the need for labeled data (zero-shot approach). Results indicate that SeisCoDE effectively captures critical seismic features and characteristics, producing robust latent feature representations that drive downstream seismic interpretation. It demonstrates enhanced generalization abilities across different seismic interpretation tasks, outperforming the conventional supervised learning UNet method. Overall, this research emphasizes the potential of FMs informed by seismic image processing and attribute analysis principles, paving the way for continued innovation integrating FMs for seismic interpretation, with the potential to revolutionize subsurface characterization and geophysical seismic exploration.</description>
