      <title>Helicity controls the direction of fluxes in rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence sustains out-of-equilibrium fluxes that are shaped by conservation laws. Three-dimensional flows conserve energy and sign-indefinite helicity, both being transferred to small scales. Here, we uncover a dual organization of energy fluxes in 3D rotating flows, shaped by helicity. When sufficiently-fast inertial waves interact with a large-scale 2D flow, they conserve their helicity separately by sign. This causes an inverse energy transfer, from 3D to 2D motions, which promotes self-organization and spectral condensation. In contrast, slower modes exchange helicity with modes of opposite helicity sign, similarly to non-rotating 3D turbulence. This generates a forward energy transfer, from the large-scale 2D flow to small 3D scales, coexisting with the inverse transfer. We determine analytically these bi-directional energy transfers to the 2D mean flow via a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory. The theory captures the main Reynolds number and rotation rate dependence of the mean-flow amplitude in Navier-Stokes simulations from zero to infinite rotation rates.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic and Geometric Analysis of Trochoidal Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the geometry of Gerstner's water wave model, we analyse the velocity of his fluid particles in a reference frame that moves with the wave. Gerstner wave profiles are cycloidal, curtate (flattened) trochoids, or prolate (extended) trochoids. We derive both the height of each profile's characterising point (cusp, inflection, or self-intersection), as well as a condition under which the arc lengths of prolate and curtate profiles coincide over a single wave cycle. We conclude with a discussion of how Galilean transformations affect particle acceleration and the geometry of their trajectories.</description>

      <title>Development of Rheological Constitutive Modeling Method Using a Sparse Identification Algorithm: A Case Study for Extensional Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving constitutive models (CMs) from numerical data has been an attractive approach as a systematic CM building method. One recent study is {\it Rheo}-SINDy, which extended the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to the field of rheology. Although the {\it Rheo}-SINDy framework discovered an approximate CM from numerical data under shear flow, its versatility has not been investigated. To clarify its applicability to other types of flows, this study applied {\it Rheo}-SINDy to numerically generated data under extensional flow conditions. As baseline tests for extensional flow, we considered two problems: (i) whether the {\it Rheo}-SINDy framework can reproduce the famous Giesekus model from data generated by that model, and (ii) whether it can derive an approximate CM from data generated by a dumbbell model with a finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) spring. For problem (i), we confirmed that {\it Rheo}-SINDy can identify the exact expression of the Giesekus model. For problem (ii), the Rheo-SINDy framework discovered a relatively simple expression of the approximate CM by manually designing the library matrix based on rheological knowledge. This identified CM can reasonably predict extensional rheological properties, including an extrapolation region. These findings demonstrate the fundamental validity of using {\it Rheo}-SINDy in extensional flow.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Growth in Stably Stratified Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate uncertainty growth and chaotic dynamics in statistically steady, stably stratified three-dimensional turbulence. Using direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations, we quantify the divergence of initially infinitesimal perturbations via twin simulations and decorrelator diagnostics. At short times, perturbations exhibit exponential growth, allowing us to define a (largest) Lyapunov exponent. We systematically examine how this exponent depends on stratification strength, quantified by the Brunt--V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} frequency and the Froude number, in a parameter regime relevant to oceanic flows. We find that increasing stratification leads to a monotonic reduction of the Lyapunov exponent, indicating suppressed chaoticity. Despite this reduction, uncertainty growth retains the universal temporal sequence observed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence -- initial decay, exponential growth, and saturation. The growth phase is characterized by self-similar decorrelator spectra, but exhibits strong anisotropy: uncertainty spreads much more slowly along the stratification direction than horizontally, with the disparity increasing with stratification strength. An analysis of the decorrelator evolution equation reveals that the suppression of chaos arises primarily from strain-mediated alignment dynamics rather than direct buoyancy coupling. Our results provide a quantitative characterization of predictability and uncertainty growth in stratified turbulence and highlight the utility of decorrelator-based methods for anisotropic geophysical flows.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Immersed Boundary Method for Fluid-Structure Interaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems remains a central challenge in computational physics. High-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods offer low numerical errors and excellent scalability on modern architectures, making them attractive for high-fidelity FSI simulations. This study presents a high-order immersed boundary method (IBM) for FSI problems which combines a volume-penalization approach with a high-order nodal DG solver. To improve near wall accuracy, an anisotropic p-adaptation strategy based on reinforcement learning is used to dynamically adjust the polynomial orders in the mesh elements located near the moving immersed boundaries. By doing so, we show enhanced accuracy with a limited increase in computational cost. Accurate evaluation of surface forces is achieved using symmetric high-order Gaussian quadrature on immersed boundaries. The proposed method is coupled with both rigid-body and elastic-structure solvers within a partitioned framework. Numerical validations using a pitching airfoil, stall flutter of an airfoil, and flow-induced vibration of an elastic beam behind a cylinder demonstrate high-order accuracy and robustness. These results indicate that the present approach provides an effective and scalable strategy for complex moving-boundary FSI simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating non-trivial incompressible flows with a quantum lattice Boltzmann algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have been identified as a potential means to accelerate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, with the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) being a promising candidate for realizing quantum speedups. Here, we extend the recent quantum algorithm for the incompressible LBM to account for realistic fluid dynamics setups by incorporating walls, inlets, outlets, and external forcing. We analyze the associated complexity cost and show that these modifications preserve the asymptotic scaling, and potential quantum advantage, of the original algorithm. Moreover, to support our theoretical analysis, we provide a classical numerical study illustrating the accuracy, complexity, and convergence of the algorithm for representative incompressible-flow cases, including the driven Taylor-Green vortex, the lid-driven cavity flow, and the flow past a cylinder. Our results provide a pathway to accurate quantum simulation of nonlinear fluid dynamics, and a framework for extending quantum LBM to more challenging flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study for physics-informed direct numerical simulation describing particle suspension in high-loaded compartments of air-segmented flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Archimedes Tube Crystallizer (ATC) employs air-segmented flow in coiled tubes to achieve narrow residence time distributions for continuous crystallization. Taylor and Dean vortices drive particle suspension in this system. However, one-way coupled models fail to capture the fluid-particle feedback that becomes critical at higher loadings. We present a particle-resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) framework based on a Finite Element-Fictitious Boundary Method with hard-contact modeling of particle interactions. Simulations of L-alanine suspensions across varying particle sizes, solid contents, and rotational speeds are validated against experimental side-view imaging. Three quantitative metrics-axial distribution, radial index, and vertical asymmetry-are introduced to classify suspension regimes. The DNS results reproduce the experimentally observed flow map zones (green, yellow, red/yellow, red) and resolve subtle transitions such as rear loading and loss of vertical symmetry. This feasibility study demonstrates that DNS can reliably predict dense suspension behavior and provides a mechanistic foundation for crystallizer design.</description>

      <title>Nature of continuous spectra in wall-bounded shearing flows of FENE-P fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the spatially local nature of the constitutive equations typically used to model polymeric stresses, the differential operators governing the linearized dynamics of bounded viscoelastic shearing flows have singular points. As a result, the eigenspectra of such shearing flows contain, in addition to discrete eigenvalues, continuous spectra (CS) comprising singular eigenfunctions. A clear understanding of the theoretical CS loci is crucial in discriminating physically genuine (discrete) eigenvalues from the poorly approximated numerical CS. For rectilinear shear flows of Oldroyd-B fluids, the CS are a pair of line segments, with lengths equal to the base-state range of velocities. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive account of the nature of the CS for both rectilinear and curvilinear shearing flows of the FENE-P fluid. In stark contrast to the CS for the Oldroyd-B fluid mentioned above, we show analytically that there are up to six distinct continuous spectra for shearing flows of FENE-P fluids. When the finite extensibility parameter $L &gt; 50$, as appropriate for large molecular weight polymers used in experiments, three of the CS are nearly identical, and independent of the solvent-to-solution viscosity ratio ($\beta$). The other three CS are $\beta$-dependent, with one of them being the analogue of the solvent (viscous) continuous spectrum in the Oldroyd-B fluid. The remaining two $\beta$-dependent CS are novel features of the FENE-P spectrum, and can have phase speeds outside the base range of velocities, including negative ones. The complexity of the CS predicted here for shearing flows of FENE-P fluids is expected to carry over to other nonlinear viscoelastic models that exhibit a shear-thinning rheology.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium formulation for inertial particles in turbulent swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of inertial particles in turbulence using datasets obtained from both direct numerical simulations and laboratory experiments of turbulent swirling flows. By analyzing time series of particle velocity increments at different scales, we show that their evolution is consistent with a Markov process across the inertial range. This Markovian character enables a coarse-grained description of particle dynamics through a Fokker-Planck equation, from which we can extract drift and diffusion coefficients directly from the data. The inferred coefficients reveal scale-dependent relaxation and noise amplitudes, indicative of inertial filtering and intermittency effects. Beyond the kinematic description, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of particle trajectories by computing the trajectory-dependent entropy production. We show that the statistics of entropy fluctuations satisfy both the Integral Fluctuation Theorem and, under certain conditions, the Detailed Fluctuation Theorem. These results establish a quantitative bridge between stochastic thermodynamics and particle-laden flows, and open the door to modeling turbulent transport using effective stochastic theories constrained by data and physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively mapping the Eady model onto a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-layer quasigeostrophic model (2LQG) and the Eady model are two idealized systems illustrating the baroclinic instability of atmospheric jets and ocean currents. The two setups share many ingredients -- background vertically sheared zonal flow of density-stratified fluid in a rapidly rotating frame -- while differing in complexity and dimensionality. The Eady model has a continuous vertical direction, with baroclinic turbulence induced by boundary potential vorticity (PV) gradients at top and bottom. By contrast, the 2LQG sytem typically models baroclinic instability induced by interior PV gradients. This distinction challenges our ability to clearly identify a couple of 'modes' through which the Eady dynamics could be inferred from a simpler 2LQG system. In the present study, we show that this difficulty can be circumvented in the turbulent regime arising for weak bottom drag. Namely, guided by the common organization of both systems into a gas of coherent vortices, we identify a quantitative mapping between the Eady and the 2LQG models. The mapping allows for parameter-free predictions of the eddy diffusivity of the Eady model based on the knowledge of the 2LQG diffusivity. We illustrate these results using numerical simulations of the Eady and 2LQG models with linear or quadratic bottom drag.</description>

      <title>Radial modes of pressure bumps and dips in astrophysical discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the signatures of pressure extrema on global oscillations in discs. To this end, we use the framework of wave topology to establish a generalised local dispersion relation that includes pressure gradients. We highlight the influence of a previously unrecognized epicyclic-acoustic frequency and derive an analytical criterion for the existence of a branch of modes transiting between the inertial and the pressure bands. We find that pressure extrema consist of wave guides in which such topological modes propagate. The fundamental mode trapped at a pressure bump can propagate at all frequencies, allowing it to resonate with any temporal forcing, while the mode associated with a pressure gap propagates at a fixed frequency, propagates with arbitrary vertical phase velocity. These specific features make them attractive candidates for future discoseismology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the impact of a flat, horizontal disk onto a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its vapor phase. We observe exceptionally high impact pressures deviating strongly from the inertial scaling found for impact in a non-condensable environment, coinciding with the rapid collapse of the vapor pocket entrapped below the disk. We explain our findings, which are relevant for the safe transportation of cryogenic fuels, as a result of vapor condensation, leading to accelerated vapor pocket contraction at high impact velocity and low vapor density.</description>

      <title>Thermo-viscous instability of flow in a weakly heat-conducting channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An instability may arise when a hot viscous fluid enters a thin gap and cools through heat transfer to a colder surrounding environment. Fluids whose viscosity increases strongly upon cooling create a positive feedback in which warmer regions flow faster and cool more slowly, leading to the formation of thermo-viscous "fingers". Here we investigate this mechanism in the long time, small Biot number regime, where cooling through the plates is weak but acts over sufficiently long times that the temperature becomes nearly uniform across the gap heat. This asymptotic limit enables a depth-averaged description that incorporates both thermal diffusion and hydrodynamic (Taylor) dispersion, allowing us to analyze the dependence of the instability on the P\'eclet number, viscosity contrast, and wall cooling rate. Using numerical simulations of temperature-dependent viscous flow in a Hele-Shaw geometry, we show that fingering instabilities emerge in response to small inlet perturbations within a range of P\'eclet numbers and viscosity contrasts. From linear stability analysis we find the dispersion relation and quantify how the fastest growth rate $\gamma_{\max}$ and corresponding wavenumber $k_{\max}$ depend on the global parameters. We further derive analytical expressions for $\gamma_{\max}$ and $k_{\max}$ in the limit of high P\'eclet number and large viscosity contrast, revealing the scaling behavior that controls pattern selection. These results clarify the physical mechanisms driving thermo-viscous fingering in the small Biot number regime and have implications for systems in which temperature-dependent viscous fluids are confined within narrow gaps, such as lubrication flows in mechanical components and magma invasion in small scale fissures.</description>

      <title>Implicit Incompressible Porous Flow using SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implicit porous flow solver using SPH, which maintains fluid incompressibility and is able to model a wide range of scenarios, driven by strongly coupled solid-fluid interaction forces. Many previous SPH porous flow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid interface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid and solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows us to extend SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account and results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can simulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid and solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit forces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces. These we solve as a linear system and strongly couple with fluid viscosity and solid elasticity. We capture the most common effects observed in porous flow, namely drag, buoyancy and capillary action due to adhesion. To achieve elastic behavior change based on local fluid saturation, such as bloating or softening, we propose an extension to the elasticity model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model with various simulations that showcase the different aspects of porous flow behavior. To summarize, our system of strongly coupled non-pressure forces and enforced incompressibility across overlapping phases allows us to naturally model and stably simulate complex porous interactions.</description>

Abstract: A main question in the study of partial differential equations is the following: how do we understand the nature of the solutions and, in particular, how do we determine if a given solution shows turbulent or non-turbulent behaviour? Being able to answer such a question would be a major advance in the comprehension of the nature of turbulence. In this paper we focus on the case of intermittent turbulence and provide an analytical criterion, based on the crest factor, which captures the essential feature of the solutions. By computing the crest factor for the solutions of some classical equations, both linear and nonlinear, we illustrate the capability of the criterion for discerning between solutions exhibiting time-intermittent turbulence behaviour and solutions which either are not turbulent or show statistically stationary turbulence, like, for example, in the case described by Kolmogorov's theory.</description>
