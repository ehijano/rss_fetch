      <title>Benchmarking AI Performance on End-to-End Data Science Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data science is an integrated workflow of technical, analytical, communication, and ethical skills, but current AI benchmarks focus mostly on constituent parts. We test whether AI models can generate end-to-end data science projects. To do this we create a benchmark of 40 end-to-end data science projects with associated rubric evaluations. We use these to build an automated grading pipeline that systematically evaluates the data science projects produced by generative AI models. We find the extent to which generative AI models can complete end-to-end data science projects varies considerably by model. Most recent models did well on structured tasks, but there were considerable differences on tasks that needed judgment. These findings suggest that while AI models could approximate entry-level data scientists on routine tasks, they require verification.</description>

      <title>An Improved Milstein Method for the Numerical Solution of Multidimensional Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) offer powerful and accessible mathematical models for capturing both deterministic and probabilistic aspects of dynamic behavior across a wide range of physical, financial, and social systems. However, analytical solutions for many SDEs are often unavailable, necessitating the use of numerical approximation methods. The rate of convergence of such numerical methods is of great importance, as it directly influences both computational efficiency and accuracy. This paper presents a proposed theorem, along with its proof, that facilitates the numerical evaluation of the strong (and weak) order of convergence of a numerical scheme for an SDE when the analytical solution is unavailable. Additionally, we address the challenge of numerically computing the multiple stochastic integrals required by the Milstein method to achieve improved convergence rates for multidimensional SDEs. In this context, two newly proposed numerical techniques for computing these multiple stochastic integrals are introduced and compared with existing approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The methodologies are further illustrated through simulation studies and applications to widely used financial models.</description>
