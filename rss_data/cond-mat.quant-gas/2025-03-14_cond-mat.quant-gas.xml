      <title>Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical probe of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in one-dimensional confined fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of a quenched quantum impurity immersed in a one-dimensional ultracold Fermi gas, focusing on the breakdown of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation due to non-adiabatic effects. Despite a sizable impurity-bath mass imbalance, increasing interactions induce strong non-adiabatic couplings, disrupting adiabatic motion and enabling population transfer between the adiabatic potential energy curves. These transitions are governed by conical intersections arising from the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, dynamically shaping the impurity's motion through the bath. Using ab initio simulations via the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree method and a multi-channel Born-Oppenheimer framework, we track the impurity's evolution and directly prove the dynamical manifestation of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. We analyze two key scenarios: (i) a small initial shift, where a single avoided crossing drives transitions, and (ii) a large shift, where multiple avoided crossings lead to enhanced non-adiabaticity, self-trapping, and energy redistribution. Our findings establish ultracold fermionic few-body systems as tunable platforms for studying non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, opening new avenues for controlled impurity transport in strongly correlated environments.</description>

      <title>Rotation-mediated bosonic Josephson junctions in position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultracold atoms, bosons tunneling in a double-well potential can produce a typical Josephson junction in real space. A major advancement in quantum matter and simulations is anticipated by the recently found momentum-space Josephson junction effect, which elucidates the supercurrent flow between spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates at two distinct independent momentum states. For the first time, our study unveils specific protocols to engineer momentum-space Josephson dynamics for scalar bosons (or a single-component condensate) in a rotating frame through modulation of the geometry of a double-well trapping potential and rotation frequencies. In this setup, rotation simultaneously results in effective double wells both in position and in momentum spaces, and the dynamics of the corresponding Josephson junctions is hosted in these double wells. Consequently, it is observed that the rotation generates momentum-space Josephson dynamics of the condensate along the transverse direction and position-space Josephson dynamics along the longitudinal direction; these effects are particularly noticeable for high rotation frequencies. Additionally, the rotation-induced momentum-space effects are highly significant in both the mean-field and many-body dynamics. Our protocols offer a framework for investigating momentum-space Josephson effects for single-component condensate in both theoretical and experimental contexts, as well as their significant applications in quantum mechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of supersolid-like sound modes in a driven quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven systems are of fundamental scientific interest, as they can exhibit properties that are radically different from the same system at equilibrium. In certain cases, long-lived states of driven matter can emerge, which exhibit new material properties. In this work, we probe the excitation spectrum of an emergent patterned state in a driven superfluid, finding that its response is identical to that of a one-dimensional supersolid. In order to extract physical quantities that parametrize the observed sound modes, we apply an effective hydrodynamic theory of superfluid smectics, which is agnostic to microscopic processes. We therefore use the conceptual framework of supersolids to characterize an otherwise dynamic and far-from-equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Controlling the dynamical phase diagram of a spinor BEC using time-dependent potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin-mixing dynamics of a spinor BEC subject to a time-dependent confining potential. Our study provides a theory framework for the experimental results reported in Phys. Rev. A 109, 043309 (2024). We exploit the disparity of energy scales associated with the spatial and internal (spin) degrees of freedom under typical experimental conditions to develop an effective few-mode description of the spin dynamics. Our model demonstrates how the details of the potential, such as driving frequency and amplitude, can be used to independently control spin-changing and spin-preserving collision processes as well as the effective Zeeman energy of the internal states. We obtain the dynamical phase diagram of the effective model and discuss how its structure is altered relative to a spinor BEC with frozen spatial degrees of freedom. The applicability of our effective model is verified through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations that capture the interplay of spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and we identify parameter regimes that can be feasibly explored by future experiments. Our findings highlight the utility of dynamical confining potentials for the control of non-equilibrium spin-mixing dynamics in spinor BECs.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium charge-vortex duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally applied within equilibrium states, the charge-vortex dualities are expanded to address the complex dynamics of superfluids and ideal fluids under non-static conditions. We have constructed explicit mappings of finite temperature fluid dynamics to gauge theories, enabling a dual description where vortices in both superfluids and ideal fluids are interpreted as charges within these theories. We found that vortices in the normal component naturally exhibit mobility restrictions, as manifested by the symmetries and conservation laws. Next, we formulated the Li\'enard-Wiechert problem for the ideal fluid at finite temperature and extracted the wave dynamics in the system along with the speed of sound corrections for both fluid components. Finally, we computed the correlation functions for the gauge potentials, particularly elucidating explicit cross-correlations between the normal and superfluid components.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of a Dicke Model for V-Type Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear, semiclassical dynamics of an open spin-1 (three-level) variant of the traditional Dicke model. In particular, we focus on V-type energy-level configurations with varying degrees of energy-level asymmetry. We also allow for unbalanced coupling -- where co-rotating and counter-rotating Hamiltonian terms are independently tunable. We characterise the system with a dynamical systems approach, where different behaviors map to definite dynamical objects, and phase transitions to bifurcations. We find the emergence of both periodic and two-frequency oscillations, as well as multistability and chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structure factors and quantum geometry in multiband BCS superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of edge modes in monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>
