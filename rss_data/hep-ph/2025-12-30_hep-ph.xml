      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Masses of Various Meson States: A Comparative Study in SU(3) and SU(4) extended Linear-Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the extended Linear-Sigma Model (eLSM), the chiral phase structure of meson states, including pseudoscalars ($J^{pc}=0^{-+}$), scalars ($J^{pc}=0^{++}$), vectors ($J^{pc}=1^{--}$), and axial-vectors ($J^{pc}=1^{++}$), is investigated with the mean-field approximation. A systematic comparison between SU(3) and SU(4) configurations is provided. It has been found that the estimations of meson masses derived from SU(4) eLSM are more congruent with experimental values than those derived from SU(3) eLSM. Consequently, we conclude that an increase in quark degrees of freedom significantly enhances the accuracy of meson mass simulations. We investigate the effect of temperature on the masses of various meson states calculated in the SU(3) and SU(4) eLSM. After establishing all the fitting parameters, the temperature dependence of meson masses shows that although various meson states exhibit unique patterns in their mass changes with temperature, they all seem to share a similar range of dissolution temperatures. This means that the critical temperature that marks the phase transition from hadrons to quarks appears to vary slightly depending on the meson states. In this regard, we find that the quarkonium states, formed by a quark and its antiquark, are largely unaffected by variations in the temperature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from seesaw assisted collapsing domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries like $Z_2$ leads to the formation of stable topological defects such as domain walls which, if allowed to dominate, can potentially be in conflict with cosmological observations. Incorporating explicit $Z_2$-breaking bias terms can lead to annihilation of such walls while also emitting stochastic gravitational wave (GW). We study the role of heavy right-handed neutrinos present in type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino masses to generate such bias term via quantum corrections. This offers interesting correlation among the seesaw scale, GW peak amplitude and peak frequency which can be probed at present and future experiments related to GW as well as precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In flavor symmetric UV complete scenarios with degenerate RHNs at leading order, such tiny coupling of RHNs to a $Z_2$-odd scalar can also lead to small mass splittings suitable for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via resonant leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Minimal A4 Type-II Seesaw Realization of Testable Neutrino Mass Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a flavour model based on an $A_4$ symmetry combined with a type-II seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. The resulting neutrino mass matrix obeys a sum rule that, together with the measured mass-squared differences, fully determines the absolute neutrino mass spectrum. The constrained flavour structure yields correlated predictions for lepton mixing parameters, leads to inverted ordering after imposing mixing constraints, restricts the Majorana phases and implies a neutrinoless double beta decay rate close to its maximal value for inverted ordering. In the charged lepton sector an approximate triality symmetry arises in the seesaw limit, suppressing muon flavour-violating processes and allowing only specific $\tau$ decay channels. The model provides a tightly constrained and experimentally testable framework linking neutrino masses, lepton mixing and lepton-number-violating observables.</description>

      <title>Can high-$p_\perp$ theory and data constrain $\eta/s$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the temperature dependence of the specific shear viscosity $(\eta/s)$ is crucial for characterizing the properties of the QCD matter produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Since, low-$p_\perp$ theory and data are only weakly sensitive to the typical forms of $\eta/s(T)$, especially at high temperatures, we use high-$p_\perp$ data and theory to impose additional constraints on it. Our approach, based on dynamical radiative and collisional energy loss of high-$p_\perp$ particles, provides promising results in constraining the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum in the pion and kaon: rest-frame and light-front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is not a Poincar\'e invariant quantity; so, its value is observer dependent. Notwithstanding that, in quantum chromodynamics, a Poincar\'e-invariant theory, OAM is part of every hadron wave function. Using continuum Schwinger function methods, we elucidate both the subjective character of in-hadron OAM and expose some of its impacts on pion and kaon structure and observables. For instance, working with light-front projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions, it is found that the pion is a roughly 50/50 mix of light-front OAM zero and one components and the kaon is a 60/40 system. The overall picture is that (near) Nambu-Goldstone modes are complex bound states, each with significant intrinsic OAM, independent of the observer's reference frame. This feature must be accounted for in the calculation of observables. Inductively, the same is true for all hadrons.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium QCD in heavy-ion collisions: Kinetic theory and jet modifications during the initial stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on how jets are modified by the nonequilibrium quark-gluon plasma during the initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Its influence on their propagation is typically encoded in a single medium function, the dipole cross section. Its small distance behavior is characterized by the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$, and we obtain its numerical value throughout the pre-equilibrium stage, finding values comparable in magnitude to the earlier Glasma stage. We also compute the more general elastic collision kernel, obtained by Fourier transforming the dipole cross section. This constitutes an important step to facilitate the understanding of jet-medium interactions during the initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Additionally, we improve QCD kinetic theory simulations by employing a more realistic (HTL) screening mechanism to incorporate medium effects, which we compare with simpler screening mechanisms. An expanding plasma realized in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions exhibits a significantly reduced maximum anisotropy and reduced specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ when using the improved screening prescription. Moreover, we investigate the gluon splitting rates, which are typically obtained using an isotropic model for the collision kernel. Going beyond that approximation, we find that the splitting rates obtained from the nonequilibrium anisotropic kernel differ significantly both in magnitude and in their qualitative time evolution. We further identify a novel type of weak-coupling attractor, which can be observed in the ratio of the jet quenching parameter and pressure ratio, and is obtained by extrapolating to vanishing coupling. This improved kinetic theory description and novel limiting attractors contribute towards a more realistic modeling of the nonequilibrium QCD plasma and its equilibration and hydrodynamization process during the initial stages.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Primordial Black Hole Relics Through Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole relics are of significant interest in cosmology and theoretical physics. In this work, we consider tiny primordial black holes (PBHs) ( $M_{\text {PBH }} \lesssim 10^7 \mathrm{~g}$ ) which are generated soon after the end of inflation and evaporate and reheat the Universe before big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), but leave their remnants due to incomplete evaporation. These PBHs remnants may contribute as part or all of the dark matter (DM) today. Assuming that there exist PBH relics, we point out that the number density of PBH today can be directly read from the peak positions of the induced gravitational waves due to the inhomogeneous PBH distribution. If PBH relics are of Planck mass and they forms all the DM today, the PBH number density would be of $10^{-25} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ with the peak frequency 60 Hz . The peak frequency scales as $f_{\text {relic }}^{1 / 3}$ where $f_{\text {relic }}$ is the fraction of the PBH relics in the total DM density. The peak amplitude carries the information of initial PBH abundance. For monochromatic-mass PBH with the current number density $10^{-41} \sim 10^{-25} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and initial abundance $10^{-13} \sim 10^{-7}$, the amplitude may be large enough to be detected by planned gravitational wave experiments in the near future.</description>

      <title>Quark Coalescence: Formation of Mesons Including Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the quantum mechanics of coalescence of quark-antiquark pairs into mesons using a non-relativistic quark model. We derive the coalescence probabilities assuming a harmonic oscillator potential and generic Gaussian wave packet shapes for the initial quarks and antiquarks. Our particular emphasis is on modeling excited states of the meson spectrum consistently. We provide the formalism to systematically include excited states from the Particle Data Book, and many more predicted by the quark model, up to $L=4$ and masses of about 2.2 GeV for light flavors. We provide estimates of masses and decay branching ratios for unconfirmed states. We use a phase space picture which is appropriate for the quasi-classical nature of the information typically available for the quarks and antiquarks in applications like Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that for typical parton configurations expected in jets, excited meson states are populated abundantly.</description>

      <title>Probing the pair production of first-generation vector-like leptons at future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the discovery potential of the first-generation weak isosinglet Vector-Like Leptons (VLLs), denoted by $E^\pm$, via pair production at future electron-positron colliders. Our analysis adopts a comprehensive framework that incorporates beam polarization configurations and leverages detailed detector simulations. We focus on two distinct multilepton signatures: the $2\ell + 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ and $3\ell + 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ final states ($\ell = e, \mu$). Both signatures arise from the decay $E^{\pm} \to Z e^{\pm} / W^{\pm} \nu_\ell$ and are distinguished by the decay patterns of the associated gauge bosons. By applying optimized selection criteria to both signal and background events, we establish exclusion sensitivities and discovery prospects across the VLL mass spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that, for integrated luminosities of $\SI{25}{fb^{-1}}$, $\SI{90}{fb^{-1}}$ and $\SI{1000}{fb^{-1}}$ at corresponding center-of-mass (c.m.) energies of $\SI{1}{TeV}$, $\SI{1.5}{TeV}$ and $\SI{3}{TeV}$, the accessible mass range extends to approximately $\SI{490}{GeV}$, $\SI{740}{GeV}$ and $\SI{1440}{GeV}$, which represents a substantially improvement over the detection limits of existing hadron collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Radiative symmetry breaking in a gauged Zee-Babu model and its gravitational wave imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a classically scale invariant version of the Zee-Babu model governed by an $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry wherein three right handed neutrinos with identical gauge charges are present. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is additionally imposed such that the lightest right handed neutrino becomes a dark matter candidate. A spontaneous breakdown of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group is triggered radiatively through renormalisation group effects and the dimensionful parameters thus emerging are proportional to the corresponding breaking scale $v_{BL}$. We demonstrate in this study how the same $v_{BL}$ controls the dynamics of neutrino mass generation, lepton flavour violation and dark matter phenomenology. It is revealed that the scenario can simultaneously accommodate the observed neutrino masses and mixings, an appropriately low lepton flavour violation and the observed dark matter relic density for 10 TeV $\lesssim v_{BL} \lesssim$ 55 TeV. In addition, the very radiative nature of the set-up signals a strong first order phase transition in the presence of a non-zero temperature. Stochastic gravitational waves stemming from this phase transition are within the reach of detectors such as LISA and BBO. The scenario therefore emerges as a concrete platform to test classical scale invariance that is tied to neutrino masses and dark matter, through gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The $B^{+(0)} \to \bar D^{0(-)} D^{*}_{s0}(2317)^+$ decays and the molecular structure of $D^*_{s0}(2317)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a study of the $B^{+(0)} \to \bar D^{0(-)} D^{*}_{s0}(2317)^+$ reactions from the perspective that the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance is a molecular state of the $KD$ and $D_s \eta$ components. We have followed a method to evaluate the branching fractions obtaining information from the experimental data on the $B^+\to \bar D^0 K^+ D^0$, $B^+\to \bar D^0 K^0 D^+$, $B^0 \to D^- K^+ D^0$, $B^0 \to D^- K^0 D^+$ reactions, which have the $D^0 K^+$ and $D^+ K^0$ pairs in the final state. The approach concentrates the dynamics of the weak process in the branching ratios of these reactions and pays attention to the propagation of the $DK$ components and their strong interaction to form the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance. We find branching ratios for the $B^{+(0)} \to \bar D^{0(-)} D^{*}_{s0}(2317)^+$ reactions, which are compatible with the experimental data, but considering errors there is room for contributions of other nonmolecular components, although a sizeable fraction from the molecular components is a solid conclusion.</description>

      <title>Stringent constraints on non-standard neutrino interactions using high-purity $\nu_{\mu}$ CC events in IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutral-current (NC) non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with fermions can modify the flavor oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos as they propagate through the Earth. We present constraints on the NC-NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ and $\varepsilon_{\tau\tau}-\varepsilon_{\mu\mu}$ (one at a time) using a high-purity sample of $\nu_{\mu}$ charged-current (CC) atmospheric neutrino events collected by IceCube DeepCore over 7.5 years of livetime. These two parameters significantly affect the $\nu_\mu$ disappearance channel for which this golden event sample is optimized by the IceCube Collaboration. The best fit to this dataset is consistent with no NSI hypothesis, and we place the most stringent constraints to date: $-\,0.0094 &lt; \varepsilon_{\mu\tau} &lt; 0.0079$ and $-\,0.030 &lt; \varepsilon_{\tau\tau}-\varepsilon_{\mu\mu} &lt; 0.029$ at 90% confidence level.</description>

      <title>DGLAP evolution at N$^3$LO with the $\texttt{Candia}$ algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the $x$-space $\texttt{Candia}$ algorithm to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) accuracy in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for solving the DGLAP evolution equations for unpolarized parton densities in the nucleon. The algorithm is based on logarithmic expansions of the solution and can be extended to all orders in QCD. An expansion equivalent to the exact solution of the DGLAP equation at N$^3$LO is presented in the non-singlet sector. Results for approximate N$^3$LO PDFs, evolved using the most recent approximations to the N$^3$LO DGLAP splitting functions, are provided for benchmarking. The new version of the code, $\texttt{Candia-v2}$, is publicly available at https://github.com/champso1/candia-v2.</description>

      <title>Lepton Number Violation at the LHC in Radiative Neutrino Mass Models with Leptoquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for observing lepton number violation (LNV) by two units, $|\Delta L| = 2$, at the LHC within the leptoquark variant of the Zee Model, where Majorana neutrino masses arise radiatively at one-loop. The model features an $SU(2)_L$ doublet and singlet leptoquarks, whose interactions produce a distinctive same-sign dilepton plus jets signature, $pp \to \ell^{\pm}\ell'^{\pm} + \text{jets}$. Taking into account current experimental constraints, we identify the dominant production channels for this LNV signal and perform a detailed collider analysis. We find that the HL-LHC can probe leptoquark masses up to $m_{\rm LQ} \sim 1.5~\mathrm{TeV}$ with this process. Observation of this signal would provide a direct test of LNV and would unambiguously establish the Majorana nature of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Toward the Effective Light and Heavy QCD Axion Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effective parameter space associated with the axion mass and the axion decay constant in both the light and heavy QCD axion scenarios. We initiate our discussion by considering the simplest case of two axions, quantitatively analyzing the parameter space in these two distinct scenarios. We find that the axion mass ratios exhibit a high degree of similarity in these two situations. In contrast, the ratios of axion decay constants display a complete opposition. Furthermore, we generalize our conclusions to encompass the case of multiple axions.</description>

      <title>Bell nonlocality and entanglement in $\chi_{cJ}$ decays into baryon pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of Bell nonlocality and entanglement in $\chi_{cJ}$ decays into baryon pair ($B\bar{B}$) ($J=0,1,2$). From the baryon-antibaryon spin density matrix, we construct measurable Bell observables and concurrence, revealing a striking hierarchy of quantum correlations: $\chi_{c0}$ decays exhibit maximal violation and entanglement; $\chi_{c1}$ decays violate Bell inequalities for $\theta_1 \in (0, \pi)$ with angle-modulated strength; we find that $B\bar B$ in $\chi_{c2}$ decays is in separable state, and no indication is found for the Bell inequality violation. We provide complete analytical results for $J=0,1$ and quantitative, uncertainty-aware estimations for $J=2$ using experimental inputs. The results indicates that the $\chi_{cJ}$ system as a novel platform for testing quantum entanglement in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation at High-Energy Colliders via Intermediate Massive Boson Mass Measurements: Z Boson Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance (LI) is a foundational principle of modern physics, yet its possible violation (LIV) remains an intriguing window to physics beyond the Standard Model. While stringent constraints exist in the electromagnetic and hadronic sectors, the weak sector-particularly unstable bosons-remains largely unexplored. In this work, based on our recent studies and conference presentation, we analyze how LIV manifests in high-energy collider experiments, focusing on modifications of Z boson dispersion relations and their impact on resonance measurements in Drell--Yan processes. We argue that precision measurements of resonance masses at colliders provide sensitivity to LIV at the level of $10^{-9}$, comparable to bounds derived from cosmic rays. We also discuss the interplay between LIV and gauge invariance, highlighting why only specific operators provide physical effects. The phenomenological implications for both Z and W bosons are outlined, with emphasis on experimental strategies for current and future colliders.</description>

Abstract: We present a fully differential computation of $e^+\,e^-\to\gamma\,\gamma$ at next-to-next-to-leading order in QED. The process has been implemented into McMule, completing its set of next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations for the most important $2 \to 2$ processes. The results allow for generic applications to electron-positron colliders with centre-of-mass energies up to a few GeV, particularly for luminosity measurements.</description>

      <title>TauSpinner algorithms for including spin and New Physics effects in $\bar q q \rightarrow Z/\gamma^* \to \tau \tau$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible anomalous New Physics contributions to dipole and weak dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton bring renewed interest in development and revisiting charge-parity violating signatures in $\tau$-pair production in $Z$-boson decay at energies of the LHC. In this paper, we discuss effects of anomalous contributions to polarisation and spin correlations in the $\bar q q \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ production processes, with $\tau$ decays included. Because of the complex nature of the resulting distributions, Monte Carlo techniques are useful, in particular of event reweighing with studied New Physics phenomena. Extensions of the Standard Model spin amplitudes, within Improved Born Approximation used for matrix element, are implemented in the TauSpinner program. This is mainly with $\tau$ dipole and weak dipole moments in mind, but is applicable to arbitrary New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into the Standard Model $2 \to 2$ structure of matrix element extensions. Implementation allows one also to introduce arbitrary phase-shift between vector and axial-vector couplings of $Z$ boson to $\tau$ leptons, which would have impact on observed transverse spin correlations. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, together with distributions for spin correlation matrix. Numerical examples of impact on experimental signatures are shown in case of $\tau^\pm \to \rho^\pm \nu_\tau \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \nu_\tau$ decays. Information on how to use and configure the TauSpinner program is given in Appendix.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytic results for the non-singlet contributions to the three-loop mixed strong-electroweak ${\mathcal{O}}(\alpha_s^2\alpha)$ virtual corrections to the quark form factors. The primary challenge of this computation arises from the presence of massive vector bosons within the loops. This significantly increases the complexity of the integration-by-parts reduction of the scalar integrals and complicates their evaluation via the method of differential equations. To obtain the physical results, we perform the appropriate ultraviolet renormalization and subtract the universal infrared divergences. The resulting finite remainders are expressed in terms of Harmonic Polylogarithms and Generalized Polylogarithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the total decay rate of a muon being in the ground state of a Coulomb potential with atomic charge numbers $4\leq Z \leq 9$. The discrepancy between the perturbative $(\alpha Z)^2$ result of [Phys. Rev. \textbf{119}, 365 (1960)] and the fully relativistic partial-wave calculation of [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables \textbf{54}, 165 (1993)] for oxygen ($Z=8$) is shown to originate from insufficient convergence of the partial-wave series in the latter work. Our accurate relativistic calculations restore agreement with the perturbative $\alpha Z$~expansion and indicate a negative sign for the next-order $(\alpha Z)^3$ correction.</description>

      <title>Molecular states $J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $\eta_{c}B_{c}^{\ast +} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic molecules $\mathfrak{M}=J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $\widetilde{\mathfrak{ M}}=\eta _{c}B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are investigated in the framework of QCD sum rule method. These particles with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{P}}=1^+$ have the quark contents $cc \overline{c}\overline{b}$. We compute their masses and current couplings and find that they are numerically very close to each other. Because it is difficult to distinguish reliably the molecules $J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$, we treat them as identical structures, and consider in details the state $\mathfrak{M}$. Our prediction $m=(9740 \pm 70)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for its mass means that $\mathfrak{M}$ easily decays to pairs of ordinary mesons through strong interactions. There are two mechanisms responsible for transformations of $\mathfrak{M}$ to conventional mesons. The fall-apart mechanism generates the dominant decay channels $ \mathfrak{M} \to J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $\mathfrak{M} \to \eta _{c}B_{c}^{\ast +}$. Annihilation of $\overline{c}c$ quarks triggers subdominant processes with various final-state $B$ and $D$ mesons: Six of such channels are explored in this work. The partial widths of all decays are computed using the three-point sum rule approach. The width $\Gamma[ \mathfrak{M}]=(121 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the hadronic axial-vector molecule $\mathfrak{M}$, as well as its mass are valuable for running and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Partonic Entropy of the Proton from DGLAP Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of partonic entropy of the proton within the Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi (DGLAP) evolution scheme of collinear parton distributions. We show that such entropy increases monotonically with the evolution scale. The mechanism underlying this growth is illustrated using a simplified model of DGLAP evolution, which highlights the importance of including saturation effects at small $x$ in the evolution of parton distributions. Based on existing literature, we present two simplified models of parton saturation at small $x$. In one of these models, partonic entropy is identified with entanglement entropy and proposed as an observable to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>From QCD-Based Descriptions to Direct Fits: A Unified Study of Nucleon Electromagnetic Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the spacelike region by combining three complementary approaches: two GPD-based contributions and a vector-meson exchange component. By fitting experimental data, we extract the optimal weights and shape parameters describing the proton and neutron form factors. Global Pad\'e-based fits are then constructed for four distinct groups of form factors, starting from local Taylor expansions and yielding stable analytic parametrizations over the analyzed $t$ range. The combined framework provides an accurate and physically motivated description of nucleon structure within a controlled model-dependent setting across a wide range of momentum transfers.</description>

      <title>Discovery prospects for photophobic axion-like particles at a 100 TeV proton--proton collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study heavy photophobic axion-like particles (ALPs) in the limit of an effectively vanishing diphoton coupling, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\simeq 0$, for which diphoton production and decay are suppressed and collider phenomenology is driven by electroweak interactions ($aWW$, $aZ\gamma$, $aZZ$). We perform detector-level searches at a future $\sqrt{s}=$ 100 TeV $pp$ collider (SppC/FCC-hh), with an integrated luminosity of $L =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$. We consider $a\to Z\gamma$ and $a\to W^+W^-$ decays. For $pp\to jj\,a$ we include both $s$-channel electroweak exchange and vector boson fusion (VBF)-like topologies, while the tri-$W$ signature arises from associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ (via $s$-channel exchange) followed by $a\to W^+W^-$. We analyze three final states--$Z\gamma jj$ with $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$, tri-$W$ ($W^\pm W^\pm W^\mp$) with same-sign dimuons plus jets, and $W^+W^-jj$ with opposite-sign, different-flavor dilepton ($e^\pm\mu^\mp$) plus jets. A boosted-decision-tree (BDT) classifier built from kinematic observables provides the final signal--background separation. At $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV and $L =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$, we present discovery sensitivities to the ALP--$W$ coupling $g_{aWW}$ over $m_a\in[100,\,7000]$ GeV. In parallel, we report model-independent discovery thresholds on $\sigma\times\mathrm{Br}$ for $pp\to jj\,a$ with $a\to Z\gamma$ and $a\to W^+W^-$, as well as for associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ with $a\to W^+W^-$. Taken together, the three channels deliver broad coverage and mutually reinforcing checks across decay modes and production regimes, strengthening robustness against channel-dependent systematics. The 100~TeV program extends the discovery reach well beyond 14~TeV projections within a general effective field theory (EFT) description that does not assume a specific ultraviolet completion.</description>

      <title>Muonphilic asymmetric dark matter at a future muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore phenomenological constraints on, and future muon collider sensitivities to, the parameter spaces of various muonphilic portals to fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM). Both WEFT-level dimension-6 effective operators and two UV models based on gauged $L_\mu - L_\tau$ are considered. One of the latter features a vector coupling to the dark matter and the other an axial vector coupling. The ADM criterion that at least $99\%$ of the dark matter relic density is asymmetric is also imposed. We identify which of these scenarios are currently allowed by direct detection and collider constraints, and then determine how much more of the parameter space could be probed by 3 and 10 TeV muon colliders with 1 ab$^{-1}$ of data. For the UV models, the constraints from $g-2$ of the muon are included. The future sensitivity curves due to neutron star heating considerations are also depicted. We present results for both the few-GeV dark matter mass regime motivated by ADM approaches to the $\Omega_b \simeq \Omega_\text{DM}/5$ coincidence problem, and for larger masses in the context of more general ADM.</description>

      <title>Constraints on SMEFT operators from $Z \to \mu \mu bb$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a systematic framework to probe indirect effects of heavy new physics via precision measurements. While SMEFT constraints have been extensively studied using purely leptonic $Z$ decays and inclusive $Z$ production, mixed leptonic-hadronic modes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze $Z \to \mu\mu bb$ decays within the SMEFT framework, deriving constraints on dimension-six operators that affect four-fermion interactions between leptons and bottom quarks, as well as $Z$-fermion couplings. Signal and background events are simulated with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tools, including detector effects such as $b$-tagging, and limits on the relevant Wilson coefficients are extracted using kinematic distributions and a profile likelihood approach. Our results provide complementary constraints to existing SMEFT studies and yield the first process-specific limits on flavor-resolved four-fermion operators involving muons and bottom quarks from $Z$ decays.</description>

      <title>Complex scalar dark matter with effective Higgs portals beyond radiation domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasingly stringent bounds on the Higgs-portal coupling, arising from dark matter (DM) direct-detection searches, confront the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM scenario with thermal production, where freeze-out occurs in the standard radiation-dominated era. This limitation can be alleviated by introducing a dimension-5 Higgs-portal operator in the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM model and/or by modifying the standard cosmological history of the Universe. In this article, we analyze complex scalar DM production in both the reheating and radiation-dominated epochs within an effective field theory (EFT) framework. While both scenarios exhibit sizeable regions of parameter space consistent with existing constraints, freeze-out during reheating opens up additional viable regions that are otherwise ruled out by DM overabundance in the radiation-dominated scenario. Notably, the renormalizable Higgs-portal coupling is constrained by relic density, direct- and indirect-detection limits, whereas the EFT coupling associated with the dimension-5 operator is constrained by relic density and indirect-detection bounds arising from DM semi-annihilation. We further study the production cross section of complex scalar DM at hadron and lepton colliders.</description>

Abstract: Two-photon collision in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) provides a unique and powerful platform for probing QCD with linearly polarized quasi-real photons. While photon polarization effects have been recognized in dilepton and even in light hadrons production, their consequences for heavy quarkonium production remain unexplored. In this work we investigate for the first time the $\gamma\gamma \to J/\psi+\gamma(J/\psi)$ channels in Pb-Pb UPCs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), by integrating the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization approach with the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) photon distributions. Based on the helicity amplitudes at lowest order in strong coupling and velocity expansion, we predict sizable $\cos(2\phi)$ and $\cos(4\phi)$ azimuthal asymmetries arising from the interference of linearly polarized photon states. These azimuthal-dependent observables, defined as the ratios of weighted to unweighted cross sections, are expected to be stable against including the higher-order radiative corrections and varying nonperturbative NRQCD matrix elements, thus offering a fresh test of quarkonium production mechanism and the photon TMD structure in the ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>125 GeV Higgs boson rare decays in a flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Higgs boson decay channels, specifically, $h{\rightarrow}\gamma\gamma$, $h{\rightarrow} VV^*$ (with $V=Z,W$), and $h{\rightarrow} f\bar{f}$ (for $f=b,c,\tau$) within the flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model (FDM). We also investigate processes induced by flavor-changing neutral currents, including the decays $\bar B \to X_s\gamma$ and $B_s^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$, the top quark decays $t\to c h$ and $t\to u h$, and the lepton flavor-violating decays $\tau \to 3e$, $\tau \to 3\mu$, and $\mu \to 3e$. Furthermore, we incorporate the electroweak precision observables constraints via the S, T, and U parameters. Compared to the Standard Model, the scalar sector of the FDM is extended by two Higgs doublets and one Higgs singlet, which affects the 125 GeV Higgs properties significantly. Meanwhile, the decays $h{\rightarrow} Z\gamma$, $h\rightarrow MZ$, and $h{\rightarrow} M\gamma$ (where $M$ is a vector meson $(\rho,\omega,\phi,J/\Psi,\Upsilon)$ of the Standard-Model-like Higgs are studied, and we illustrate how changes in the scalar sector and the Yukawa coupling influence the signal strengths for the 125 GeV Higgs decay channels and the Higgs mass in the FDM.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning final state interactions model in NuWro Monte Carlo event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental data from MINERvA on transverse kinematics observables across four different nuclear targets - carbon, oxygen, iron, and lead - have been utilized to refine the modeling of final state interaction effects in the NuWro Monte Carlo neutrino event generator. For this purpose, we have developed an event reweighting tool for future applications to adjust the strength of final-state interactions. This study highlights the requirement for stronger nucleon reinteractions than previously assumed, but it still falls within the uncertainty range observed in a study comparing proton transparency measurements. This conclusion has significant implications for both experimental and theoretical work involving NuWro.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting charged long-lived BSM particles at MoEDAL-MAPP experiment: A mini-review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider is expanding to include unconventional signatures such as long-lived particles. This mini-review assesses the prospects for detecting electrically charged long-lived particles using the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment. We synthesize findings from recent studies that evaluate sensitivity to supersymmetric models, radiative neutrino mass scenarios, and generic multiply charged objects. A key component of this review is the comparative analysis of MoEDAL's reach against the general-purpose ATLAS and CMS experiments. We conclude that while MoEDAL is constrained by lower integrated luminosity, its passive, background-free detection methodology offers a unique advantage. Specifically, the experiment provides complementarity to the major detectors, particularly for signals involving slow-moving particles and stable states with intermediate electric charges.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for the C-angularity soft function at NNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the soft function at NLO and NNLO for a one-parameter family of event shapes we call C-angularity. This family contains C-parameter as a specific choice of the parameter, in close analogy with how conventional angularity contains thrust as a special case. By construction, C-angularity and angularity coincide in the collinear limit such that the anomalous dimensions are equal. However, unlike angularity, C-angularity is a continuously differentiable function of the final state momenta, which makes the analytic calculation of the C-angularity soft function simpler. We obtain analytical results for the C-angularity soft function and anomalous dimension as an expansion in the C-angularity parameter $a$, to third and fourth order in $a$ respectively. These expansions yield results that are accurate at the few per mille level for $-1\le a &lt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Are 2HDMs with a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry alive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of 2 Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) with a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, $U(1)_X$, by which flavor changing neutral currents are forbidden at tree level. As an important consequence of the spontaneous breaking of both the $U(1)_X$ and electroweak symmetries by electroweak vacuum expectation values, upper limits appear on masses of an additional gauge boson $Z'$ and extra Higgs bosons which are less than the TeV scale. In addition, the standard model (SM) like Higgs boson $h$ and a heavier Higgs boson $H$ mainly decay into a pair of $Z'$ which induces four lepton final states. These new decay modes cannot be suppressed by taking no $Z$-$Z'$ mixing and/or the Higgs alignment limit. We find that the minimum setup of these 2HDMs has been excluded by current data for four lepton searches at LHC. Such severe constraints can, however, be avoided by introducing a pair of vector-like fermions $\chi$ which are singlet under the SM symmetry but charged under $U(1)_X$, and can be a candidate of dark matter. Thanks to the existence of $\chi$, $Z'$ can mainly decay into $\chi\bar{\chi}$ instead of SM leptons. As benchmark models, we consider the $U(1)_H$ and $U(1)_R$ models realized by fixing specific $U(1)_X$ charges, and find regions of parameter space allowed by theoretical and current experimental constraints. We clarify that $m_H \in [160, 220]$ GeV and $\tan \beta \in [3, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)_H$ model, while $m_H \in [160, 380]$ GeV and $\tan \beta \in [1.6, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)_R$ model. In both the models, the $Z'$ mass is constrained to be $100~\text{GeV} \lesssim m_{Z'} \lesssim 110$ GeV. Such a quite limited parameter space can further be explored at future collider experiments, e.g., High-Luminosity LHC and lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>False-vacuum decay and flaws in Frampton's model of the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review false-vacuum decay and examine a recent proposal by Frampton to model the origin of the first single-celled organism (SCO) as a phase transition between no-life and life vacua. In his calculation the exponent $n$ entering the probability $P_{\rm SCO}\sim 10^{-n}$ has dimensions of inverse time: it is an energy barrier divided by the Planck constant, rather than a dimensionless tunnelling action. The resulting probability is mathematically ill-defined and does not determine a tunnelling rate. Apart from this dimensional issue, the assumed initial configuration, a toroidal structure made of long molecules, and its treatment in empty space are inconsistent with soft-matter physics and with the hot, collisional environment expected for prebiotic chemistry. Consequently, the claimed exponential suppression of biogenesis, and the inference that extraterrestrial life is likely absent, are not supported.</description>

      <title>Simulation of tau decays, ambiguities and anomalous couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of low energy tau decays and radiative corrections in decays, not much has changed since the last, Tau23 conference. Also, TAUOLA, tau decay library, and PHOTOS for radiative corrections in decays have not changed much, neither for QED nor for New Physics processes application. Progress was in the domain of flexibilities for applications and in the domain of New Physicists. There was progress with use of exclusive exponentiation (KKMC Monte Carlo) to evaluate quality of tau pair formation and decay factorization, with Collins-Soper and Mustraal frames. Ambiguities for New Physics or other processes could be thus addressed. Associated projects of KKMC f77 and KKMCee C++, are presented: (i) $\pi^+ \pi^-$ pair production at Belle II energies, interesting input for Pi_gammagamma(s), (ii) attribution of helicity like labels for taus in simulated HepMC3 format events, (iii) also tau polarimetric vectors prepared for user application of New Physics.</description>

      <title>Defect Formation in NaI Crystals: A Novel Pathway to Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium iodide (NaI) is a widely used scintillator in direct dark matter searches. In particular, NaI-based cryogenic scintillating calorimeters have emerged as promising candidates, like in the COSINUS experiment, for testing the annually modulating signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA. In this study, we investigate defect formation within NaI crystals and its impact on the dark matter detection signal. Using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory techniques, we simulate a DM particle collision on an NaI crystal, focusing on the possible defects formation and their structural and electronic properties. Our analysis includes a detailed study of the electronic states associated with the interstitial atoms and vacancies, the energetic cost of defect formation, and the anisotropic threshold displacement energy. Finally, we highlight the potential to exploit dark matter-induced defects as a novel detection channel, enabled by the introduction of new states within the electronic band gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the twist-2 unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of quarks for an on-shell gluon target in quantum chromodynamics. These GPDs parametrize the leading-twist matrix elements of the nonlocal light-like flavor-singlet vector current. We compute them at one-loop accuracy in perturbation theory using a quark mass and dimensional regularization as infrared regulators. In particular, we discuss the limit of vanishing momentum transfer. The present work extends our previous related study on the axial current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Krauss-Nasri-Trodden (KNT) model provides a unified framework for addressing the smallness of neutrino masses (by a three-loop radiative mechanism) and the dark matter abundance (via thermal freeze-out) simultaneously. In this work, we investigate the implications of renormalization group effects on the model's parameter space. To this end, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to identify the viable regions of parameter space that is consistent with all the relevant experimental and theoretical constraints at low energies. We show that a significant portion of the low-energy viable region is incompatible with the vacuum stability conditions once the renormalization group effects are taken into account. Most of the remaining parameter space of the model can be probed in future charged lepton flavor violating experiments.</description>

      <title>Soft and Jet functions for SCET at four loops in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft-Collinear Effective Theory is a framework for systematically organizing and resumming the logarithmic contributions that occur in high-energy reactions. It provides a factorized description of cross sections in terms of hard, jet, soft, and beam functions. As the latter are universal, they can be obtained from the well-known perturbative results in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan and Higgs boson productions. Using the recent results ~\cite{Kniehl:2025ttz} on four-loop eikonal $(f^I)$ and collinear anomalous dimensions $(B^I)$ for quarks and gluons, $I=q,g$, as well as perturbative results from previous orders, we present four-loop predictions for the quark and gluon soft and jet functions. They constitute an important component of the $N$-jettiness subtraction method at $\rm{N^4LO}$ accuracy in QCD, which eventually may enable the calculation of fully-differential cross sections at higher orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the $D$-wave isoscalar $\pi\pi/K\bar K$ coupled-channel Omn\`es matrix, formulated to satisfy unitarity, analyticity, and the appropriate asymptotic behavior. We employ a two-channel $K$-matrix model containing poles associated with the $f_{2}(1270)$ and $f_{2}'(1525)$ resonances. The resulting unitary scattering matrix, which reproduces the experimental $\pi\pi\to\pi\pi$ and $\pi\pi\to K\bar K$ data and PDG information, serves as input to the homogeneous two-channel Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es equation. We compare our Omn\`es matrix with previous constructions based on $\pi\pi\to K\bar K$ phases extracted from sums of Breit-Wigner amplitudes. The Omn\`es matrix developed here provides a reliable dispersive input for form-factor calculations and resonance studies in the tensor-meson sector. As an application, we show that it enables a simultaneous and accurate description of the BESIII $J/\psi\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\gamma$ and $J/\psi\to K_{S}K_{S}\gamma$ spectra in the $J=2$ electric-dipole (E1) partial wave.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Hadronic Matter on Parton Energy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified thermal distributions (dispersion relations) are introduced within both the MATTER and LBT event generators used to describe jet modification in a heavy-ion collision, within the JETSCAPE framework. Hard partons, propagating through dense matter, scatter off the partonic substructure of the medium, leading to stimulated emission, accompanied by recoiling medium partons. We introduce a simple modification, a multiplicative $(1 + a/T)$ correction to the dispersion relation of quarks and gluons (equivalent to an effective fugacity). This leads to calculated transport coefficients (e.g. $\hat{q}/T^3$) showing the expected behavior of depreciating at lower temperatures, including within the hot hadronic gas. This simple modification recovers the light-like dispersion relations at high temperatures, and introduces an excess depreciation factor for parton populations at lower temperatures, allowing partonic energy loss and recoil calculations to be extended into the hadronic phase. This modified distribution, in combination with initial state cold nuclear matter effects (shadowing), is used to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic anisotropy of jets and leading hadrons, over multiple centralities and collision energies.</description>

Abstract: This dissertation presents a systematic theoretical investigation into realizing a condensed matter analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in a quasi-planar, 2+1D system. The research establishes a conceptual bridge between the anomalous transport phenomena of high-energy physics and the emergent electronic properties of engineered honeycomb lattices. The central objective is the formulation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the necessary ingredients for a CME-like effect. This is achieved by moving beyond pristine graphene, whose inherent sublattice symmetry precludes the formation of a mass gap necessary for defining robust pseudo-chiral states. The core of this work is a model based on a honeycomb lattice with explicitly broken sublattice symmetry, which introduces a band gap and endows the quasi-particles system with a well-defined pseudo-chirality based on sublattice polarization. A time-reversal symmetry-breaking parameter is introduced to asymmetrically modify the valley gaps, creating a controllable non-equilibrium imbalance analogous to the chiral chemical potential in relativistic systems. A key finding is the validation of the physical model consistency; through commutator calculations, the total angular momentum - comprising both orbital and an emergent lattice spin component - is shown to be a conserved quantity. This research successfully transforms the abstract possibility of a 2D CME into a concrete, self-consistent theoretical framework, detailing the precise symmetry conditions required for its manifestation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Predictions for T Coronae Borealis: Probing Particle Acceleration in Novae</title>

Abstract: The MAGIC detection of near-TeV gamma-rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) has established it as a TeV-scale particle accelerator. However, the underlying production mechanism --\textit{hadronic} versus \textit{leptonic}-- remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario.</description>

      <title>Extracting light-cone wave functions from covariant amplitudes: a detailed study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjectured formula that systematically maps covariant off-shell amplitudes to light-cone wave functions in scalar field theory. Through an explicit comparison at one-loop accuracy, we establish its equivalence to the light-cone perturbation theory series, thereby validating the conjecture at this order. Applying this formula, we efficiently re-derive wave functions from known covariant amplitudes, bypassing both the conceptual complexities of light-cone quantization and the technical challenges of perturbative calculations in this framework. In addition to simplifying computations, this approach opens new avenues for applications in gauge theories and deeper explorations of the fundamental equivalence between covariant and light-cone quantization.</description>

      <title>Heavy dark matter in rapidly evolving massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of heavy dark matter (DM) captured in massive stars via scattering(s) with the star constituents. We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the two-field scalar and spinor Quantum Electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic resurgent analysis of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics for the most general constant background field configuration. In contrast to the extensively studied single-field cases, the two-field case exhibits unique asymptotic structures, leading to a substantially richer pattern of singularities in the Borel plane. Explicit large-order asymptotic formulas for the weak-field coefficients in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics are derived. These reveal a nontrivial interplay between alternating and non-alternating factorial growth, governed by distinct structures associated with electric and magnetic contributions, and smoothly interpolating between the known single-field limits. Using Borel dispersion techniques, we demonstrate that the complete instanton structure underlying Schwinger pair production in two-field backgrounds is encoded in the divergent perturbative coefficients. We then construct resurgent approximants using Pad\`e-Borel and Pad\`e-Conformal-Borel resummation schemes adapted to the two-field case. For the spinor case, conformal improvement results in a significant enhancement in reconstructing both the real and imaginary parts of the effective Lagrangian across a wide range of field ratios, accurately capturing the subtle sign-changing features in the strong-field regime. In the scalar case, it yields only marginal improvement. Detailed comparisons with exact special-function representations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructions from a modest number of weak-field coefficients. This work establishes a natural completion of the resurgence programme for constant electromagnetic backgrounds, providing a robust analytic framework for exploring nonperturbative physics and strong-field phenomena in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics, from finite perturbative data.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes within Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) during the radiation-dominated era. The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $\sigma(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $\beta(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number.</description>

Abstract: We report on the presence of families of exact solutions for a complex scalar field that behaves according to the rules of discrete $Z_N$ symmetry. Since the family of models is exactly solved, the results appear to be of interest to integrability, to build junctions and networks of localized structures and to describe scalar dark matter in high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Decay around Black Holes formed from Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the problem of vacuum decay in the presence of spherically symmetric black holes. Within the semiclassical approximation, we study configurations describing a bubble of true vacuum propagating outside a black hole formed from gravitational collapse. We find that the saddle point is dominated by a single energy state and that the dependence on the initial conditions in the stellar interior vanishes exponentially fast at late stages of the collapse. Prescriptions are given for implementing the corresponding boundary conditions in the eternal black-hole geometry. We find that vacuum decay can only be weakly catalyzed by the black hole, as the suppression exponent attains a minimum at a finite black-hole mass. In the limit of vanishing black-hole mass, the suppression smoothly approaches the flat-space result.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Cosmic-ray boosted Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Light Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional direct detection experiments lack the sensitivity to probe the sub-GeV dark matter (DM), primarily due to the low energy of the expected nuclear recoils. In this work, we investigate cosmic-ray (CR) upscattering as a mechanism to accelerate DM particles to detectable velocities in underground experiments. By analyzing four models of DM-nucleon interactions -- namely scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector mediators -- we derive constraints on the coupling parameters using data from the LZ, XENON, and Borexino experiments, covering mediator mass from $10^{-6}$ to $1$ GeV. As the mediator mass varies, the shift in dominance between momentum transfer and mediator mass leads to a turnover in the constraints around $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Our results extend the reach of direct detection into the sub-GeV window and clarify the critical role of momentum dependence in light-mediator scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We present the most precise determination to date of the ground-state masses of the triply charmed baryons with both parities, obtained by continuum extrapolation and fully addressing the systematic uncertainties. The calculations are performed on six $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles, generated by the MILC collaboration, with two complementary setups for the valence charm action, one using the HISQ action and the other using the overlap fermion action. Our prediction for the mass of the lowest two triply charmed spin-3/2 baryons are: $M_{\Omega_{ccc}} (3/2^{+}) = 4793 (5) \left(^{+11}_{-8}\right)$ MeV, and $M_{\Omega_{ccc}} (3/2^{-}) = 5094 (12) \left(^{+19}_{-17}\right)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Equation of State with Nucleon Short-Range Correlations: A Concise Review and Open Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and the associated high-momentum tail (HMT) in its momentum distribution $n(k)$ represent a universal feature of strongly interacting Fermi systems. In nuclear matter, SRCs arise primarily from the spin-isospin dependence of the tensor and short-range components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, leading to a substantial depletion of its Fermi sea and a characteristic $k^{-4}$ tail populated predominantly by isosinglet neutron-proton pairs. These microscopic structures modify both the kinetic and interaction contributions to the Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter and thereby influence a broad range of neutron-star (NS) properties. This short review provides a streamlined overview of how SRC-induced changes in $n(k)$ reshape the kinetic EOS, including its symmetry energy part and how these effects propagate into macroscopic NS observables, including mass-radius relations, tidal deformabilities, direct Urca thresholds and core-crust transition. We summarize key existing results, highlight current observational constraints relevant for testing SRC-HMT effects, and outline open questions for future theoretical, experimental, and multimessenger studies of dense nucleonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the poles and the resulting dispersion spectra from the relativistic kinetic equation have been analyzed with the help of a proposed collision kernel that conserves both the energy-momentum tensor and particle current by construction. The dispersion relations, which originally come out in the form of logarithmic divergences, in the long wavelength limit exhibit the systematic gradient structure of the relativistic hydrodynamics. The key result is that, in the derivative expansion series, the spatial gradients appear in perfect unison with the temporal gradients in the non-local relaxation operator like forms. It is then shown that this dispersion structure, including non-local temporal derivatives, is essential for the preservation of causality of the theory truncated at any desired order.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel semiclassical framework tailored to determine the scaling dimensions of heavy neutral composite operators in conformal field theories (CFTs) which are inaccessible with other current methodologies. It utilizes the state-operator correspondence to map the desired scaling dimensions to the semiclassical energy spectrum of periodic homogeneous field configurations on a cylinder. As concrete applications, we provide detailed analyses for the $\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions and $\phi^6$ near three dimensions, semiclassically determining the full spectrum of neutral operators in the traceless symmetric Lorentz representations. Our methodology is presented pedagogically and is readily applicable to a vast class of CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lunar-based gravitational-wave interferometry is a fascinating endeavor, and was proposed as a promising approach to bridge the observational gap between space-borne and ground-based detectors. In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band.</description>

      <title>The renormalization group invariants and exact results for various supersymmetric theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent all-loop results on the renormalization of supersymmetric theories are summarized and reviewed. In particular, we discuss how it is possible to construct expressions which do not receive quantum corrections in all orders for certain ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. For instance, in ${\cal N}=1$ SQED+SQCD there is a renormalization group invariant combination of two gauge couplings. For the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model there are two such independent combinations of the gauge and Yukawa couplings. We investigate the scheme-dependence of these results and verify them by explicit three-loop calculations. We also argue that the all-loop exact $\beta$-function and the corresponding renormalization group invariant can exist in the $6D$, ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric higher derivative gauge theory interacting with a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes and Conservative Binary Dynamics at $O(G^5)$ without Self-Force Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>

      <title>Limits of applicability of holographic dual descriptions to QCD: virtuality and coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtuality and coherence determine the limits of applicability of holographic concepts in QCD. In light-front quantization, the invariant mass controls the off-shell behavior of a physical process and thus provides a measure of its virtuality. In impact space, the corresponding quantity is the invariant transverse separation between quarks and gluons, $\zeta$, which is identified with the holographic coordinate $z$ in holographic light-front QCD. By embedding the internal structure of hadrons and implementing an effective superconformal symmetry, the mapping between quantum states and classical gravity -- central to the holographic principle -- yields new analytic insights into the strong-interaction dynamics responsible for the emergence of a confinement scale and the observed hadron spectrum. We show that the possible emergence of a gravity dual to physical QCD is restricted to the Regge limit of high-energy scattering, where many partonic degrees of freedom participate coherently. This criterion provides a quantitative definition of the domain of applicability of holographic QCD to dynamical processes and allows it to be tested directly against experimental results. By further enforcing analyticity together with exact QCD constraints at asymptotic infinity, the holographic framework can be consistently extended beyond the infrared domain. To illustrate this procedure, we briefly discuss recent work by the HLFHS collaboration, where the effective strong coupling was extended from the Regge-limit domain, through the near-perturbative transition region, and into the ultraviolet Bjorken-limit domain. The resulting scheme provides a unified and precise nonperturbative description of the strong coupling across all virtuality scales.</description>

      <title>Valence Quark Distributions in Pions: Insights from Tsallis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the valence quark distributions of pions at a low initial scale ($Q^2_0$) by employing Tsallis entropy, a non-extensive measure that effectively captures long-range correlations among internal constituents. Utilizing the maximum entropy approach, we adopt two distinct functional forms and fit experimental data through the elegant GLR-MQ-ZRS evolution equation to derive the model parameters. Our findings indicate that the resulting valence quark distributions provide an optimal fit to experimental data, with the values of the $q$ parameter deviating from unity. This deviation indicates the significant role that correlations among valence quarks play in shaping our understanding of pion internal structure. Additionally, our computations of the first three moments of pion quark distributions at $ Q^2 = 4 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2$ display consistency with other theoretical models, thereby reinforcing the importance of incorporating valence quark correlations within this analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nucleon Structure through Sub- and Near-threshold $\phi$-Meson Photoproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to investigate short-range correlations (SRCs) in nuclei by studying sub and near-threshold photoproduction of $\phi$-meson. The feasibility of exploring this nuclear structure in electron-positron collision experiments such as Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) and Super $\tau$-Charm Facility (STCF) was investigated by utilizing their beryllium-based ($^{9}$Be) beam pipe. The cross sections for these processes as well as the likelihood of detection by BESIII and STCF are calculated. Due to the limited number of events, BESIII is inadequate for the proposed measurement, while the future STCF provides a higher probability of successfully measuring this process. These findings suggest that electron-positron collider could play a valuable role in elucidating the fundamental physics behind the nuclear modification of parton distribution functions. This proposed analysis of photon-nucleon interactions represents uncharted territory, promising fresh prospects for applications in both particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>CGC-induced longitudinal ridge in p-Pb collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory, we investigate the long-range rapidity correlations in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. A distinctive correlation rebound is observed, where the correlation bounces after reaching a minimum at large rapidity gaps ($|\Delta \eta|&gt;2$). The rebound means a strong correlation appears at large rapidity gap. Studying the rebound structures can thus illuminate the formation of the ridge. We find that the rebound is most obvious when the transverse momenta of two measured particles are around 2 $\mathrm{GeV/c}$, and it moves to larger rapidity gaps at higher collision energies. Beyond that, the rapidity correlations in p-Pb collisions show asymmetry when the transverse momenta of two particles differ. The asymmetry, a unique signature of the asymmetric collisions, vanishes when the transverse momenta of two particles coincide. These findings provide direct insight into gluon saturation and quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, together with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Messenger Astroparticle Physics: the First Constraint on Light Millicharged Dark Matter via Time-Delay Analysis of GRB GW170817A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-messenger astroparticle physics provides a new approach to probe the new physics beyond the Standard Model. We propose to probe the light dark matter which can interact with electromagnetic interaction. To be concrete, we derive the new constraint on the millicharged dark matter from the multi-messenger observations of GW170817. In the neutron star merger event GW170817, the first detection of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) delayed by approximately 1.7 seconds relative to the gravitational wave emission was observed. Utilizing this delay, we constrain the parameter space of the millicharged dark matter within the large-scale structure of the Universe. For dark matter mass below $10^{-15}$ eV, the parameter $\epsilon$ is constrained to be less than $10^{-14}$, representing the most stringent limits achieved to date.</description>

      <title>Constraining lepton flavor violating SMEFT $2q2\ell$ operators from low-energy cLFV processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged lepton flavour-violating (cLFV) processes, which are definite proof of new physics beyond the Standard Model, have remained elusive experimentally till now. Effective Field Theory (EFT) has been very useful in providing information about such new physics through the higher-dimensional operators. These operators respect SM gauge invariance, and they are suppressed by appropriate powers of the energy scale $\Lambda$. In regard to lepton flavour violating (LFV) processes, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is shown to be a useful tool for estimating any new physics effect at the scale $\Lambda$. It is worth noticing that a large class of cLFV processes involve both quarks and leptons and thus low-energy observables play a significant role in providing bounds on lepton-flavour-violating 2-quark-2-lepton ($2q2\ell$) operators. Therefore, in this work, we have collected several low-energy cLFV processes that can be addressed within the SMEFT framework and also collected the set of operators responsible for such processes. Keeping in mind the correlation that exists among the SMEFT operators, we want to extract the strongest constraints on these $2q2\ell$ operators.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge field theory of the standard electroweak model in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall is investigated with an eye toward its applications to microscopic phenomena, which are supposed to have occurred during the phase transition in the early universe. The asymptotic fields are defined anew so that the effects of the position-dependent Higgs condensate are taken into account through the position-dependent $W$ and $Z$ boson masses. A novel method of massive gauge field quantization in the $R_{\xi}$-gauge with $\xi =1$ is proposed for the case of the position-dependent masses. Our procedure is based on the eigenfunction expansion method associated with second-order differential operators, i.e., a sort of generalized Fourier expansion.The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators of various wave propagation modes are given in terms of the so-called spectral function. The decoupling of unphysical states from the physical S-matrix is also investigated along the line of Kugo-Ojima's quartet mechanism on the basis of the BRST symmetry. It is pointed out that one of the quartet fields is not merely the unphysical scalar field but should be a linear combination of the unphysical scalar and the gauge fields. The physical and unphysical polarizations of the gauge field waves are unambiguously distinguished and this will help us evaluate the friction caused by the physical polarization states of $W$ and $Z$ boson waves on the bubble wall during the phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Determination of the pion generalized parton distributions at zero skewness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global QCD analysis of the pion electromagnetic form factor (FF) data from pion electroproduction and elastic pion scattering to extract the valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness. The analysis uses three different sets of pion parton distribution functions (PDFs), namely xFitter, JAM21, and MAP23, to construct the GPD ansatz. Through a $\chi^2$ minimization and a careful parametrization scan, we determine the profile function parameters and find that only two parameters are sufficient to describe the data. The extracted valence pion GPDs from different analyses have similar $x$-dependence, with minor differences at small momentum transfer. The resulting theoretical predictions for the pion electromagnetic FF and its squared magnitude show good agreement with experimental measurements. Among the three analyses, the one using the MAP23 PDFs provides the best overall fit and is adopted as the final GPD set. Our results offer a consistent determination of the valence pion GPDs, indicating a minor impact of the choice of pion PDFs. The present study provides a solid foundation for future investigations of pion structure, including its charge radius, tomography, and mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Fully heavy tetraquark states with diquark-antidiquark configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the fully heavy tetraquark state helps to better understand the characteristics of compact exotic hadrons formed by quarks and gluons. In this work, we systematically investigate the mass spectra and decay channels of fully heavy tetraquark states using a diquark-antidiquark model based on the one gluon exchange process. The tetraquark states are treated as compact diquark-antidiquark configurations, denoted as $[QQ][\bar{Q}\bar{Q}]$, where $Q = c$ or $b$. By properly accounting for the Pauli principle, basis wave functions incorporating flavor, color, and spin are constructed. The required model parameters are derived from fitting conventional hadron experimental values and lattice QCD calculations. We calculate the mass spectra and decays of the fully heavy tetraquarks in the lower $S$- and $P$-waves. Our results do not support interpreting $X(6600)$, $X(6900)$, and $X(7200)$ as the $1S$-wave fully charmed tetraquark states. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that $X(6200)$ can be a good candidate for the $1S$-wave fully charmed tetraquark state with quantum numbers $2^{++}$. Furthermore, we also identifies several narrow fully heavy tetraquark states that may be observable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality and entanglement in neutrino oscillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate wave--particle--entanglement complementarity in three-flavor neutrino oscillations within a quantum information--theoretic framework. Treating neutrino flavor evolution as an open quantum system and explicitly accounting for detector--propagation correlations, we extend the conventional wave--particle duality relation to a triality relation involving predictability, visibility, and entanglement. Using reduced density matrices and I-concurrence as a quantitative measure of entanglement, we demonstrate that the total information content of the system satisfies the relation $\mathcal{P}^2 + \mathcal{V}^2 + \mathcal{E}^2 = 1$. While predictability and visibility exhibit the expected complementary behavior, we show that entanglement encodes additional wave-like information that is not captured by visibility alone. We apply our formalism to realistic long-baseline neutrino experiments, namely \textsf{DUNE} and \textsf{T2K}, and find that at the first oscillation maximum, a simultaneous characterization of the particle-like and wave-like nature of neutrinos becomes possible through the combined measurement of predictability and entanglement. Our results provide a unified operational interpretation of neutrino oscillations and highlight the role of quantum correlations in extending wave--particle duality to multipartite systems.</description>

      <title>Light thermal dark matter models in the light of DAMIC-M 2025 constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM charged under a new Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)$, we outline two possibilities: (i) family non-universal $U(1)$ gauge coupling with resonantly enhanced DM annihilation into standard model (SM) fermions and (ii) family universal dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry where relic is set by DM annihilation into light gauge bosons. As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we construct a color gauge invariant theory of diquark interactions. With the transformation rule of the diquark fields and the definition of the covariant derivatives under color SU(3) symmetry, we construct the gauge invariant Lagrangians describing the vertices of $S-S-G$, $A-A-G$, $S_Q-S_Q-G$, $A_Q-A_Q-G$ and $S_Q-A_Q-G$, where $S_{(Q)}$ is the light (heavy) scalar diquark field, $A_{(Q)}$ is the light (heavy) axial vector diquark field, and $G$ is the gluon field. And then we derive the one-gluon-exchange effective potentials for diquark-antidiquark interactions using the obtained Lagrangians. By comparing these potentials with those in Godfrey-Isgur quark model, the coupling constants of the Lagrangians are determined. We find that the potentials are mainly made of Coulomb, contact and tensor terms. The potential for the process $S\bar{A}\to A\bar{S}$ is 0, since $\mathcal{L}_{SAG}=0$. And the tensor terms proportional to $g^2$ are negligible.</description>

      <title>Eigen-microstate Signatures of Criticality in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the eigen-microstate framework as a new approach to identify criticality in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We construct the original microstate, defined as the final-state particle fluctuations of a single event. By examining ensembles of such original microstates with and without critical signals, we demonstrate that the corresponding eigen-microstate can extract and reveal the dominant critical mode, with the largest eigenvalue serving as a robust order parameter. This framework avoids equilibrium assumptions and is insensitive to non-critical background, and the approach is directly applicable to RHIC Beam Energy Scan data, offering a powerful new tool in the search for the QCD critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low energy effective field theory of interacting neutrinos derived from the Standard Model may be framed as a pointlike interaction and thereby modeled on a lattice of neutrino momenta. We identify a path to take a continuum limit of this lattice problem in the Center of Momentum frame. In this limit, the weak interaction is found to become trivial between incoming plane waves describing ultrarelativistic particles, unless finite neutrino wave packet sizes are taken into consideration. We follow up with an analytic treatment of interacting neutrino wave packets, demonstrating the importance of the wave packet size for characterizing neutrino-neutrino scattering in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Multi-Component Axion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a mechanism for multi-component dark matter (DM) that originates from axion mixing and present some of its defining properties. In this context, multi-component DM implies that the cold DM is composed of the QCD axion and many ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs). This framework can be realized in the type IIB string axiverse with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants. Our investigation reveals that in the light QCD axion scenario, the energy density of the lightest ALP often dominates after mixing. On the other hand, in the heavy QCD axion scenario, both the QCD axion and non-lightest ALPs may dominate, depending on the ALP decay constants. Under certain conditions, the QCD axion can dominate the DM budget. Finally, we briefly discuss a theoretical framework featuring $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ axions, with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning techniques for the flavor problem in particle physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short review discusses recent applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to the flavor problem in particle physics. Traditional approaches to fermion masses and mixing often rely on extensions of the Standard Model based on horizontal symmetries, but the vast landscape of possible models makes systematic exploration infeasible. Recent works have shown that RL can efficiently navigate this landscape by constructing models that reproduce observed quark and lepton observables. These approaches demonstrate that RL not only rediscovers models already proposed in the literature but also uncovers new, phenomenologically acceptable solutions.</description>

      <title>Prompt diphoton production compared to measurements at 13 TeV in $k_t$-factorization: A comparative analysis of unintegrated PDF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth comparative analysis of unintegrated parton distribution function (UPDF) models for isolated prompt diphoton production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV within the $k_t$-factorization framework. Predictions are obtained with three UPDF approaches: Parton Branching (PB), NLO-MRW, and Modified KMRW (MKMRW). Tree-level $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma$, $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma + g$, and $q + g\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma + q$ subprocesses are generated with \textsc{KaTie} using off-shell initial states; the loop-induced $g + g\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma$ channel is evaluated independently. We compare differential cross sections with ATLAS measurements across a broad set of observables, including the photon transverse momenta, diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum, the Collins-Soper angle, acoplanarity, $\phi^*_\eta$, and a transverse thrust-related variable. This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description.</description>

      <title>Relic Density Topology as a Discriminatory Tool: A Comparative Analysis of IDM, MSSM, and NMSSM Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a diagnostic mechanism based on the relic density topology to discriminate between the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), and the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). Using a unified numerical scan with micrOMEGAs over the heavy-mass regime ($m_{x} &gt; 300$ GeV), we contrast the phenomenological profiles of these frameworks. We demonstrate that the IDM admits a broad, stable viability plateau driven by efficient gauge couplings, while the MSSM and NMSSM typically overproduce dark matter, reaching the Planck relic density only through narrow, fine-tuned resonance channels. A quantitative fine-tuning measure reveals the IDM's viable parameter space is an order of magnitude more natural than its SUSY counterparts. Furthermore, by examining the thermal decoupling epoch ($z_{f}$) and the CMB energy-injection parameter ($p_{ann}$), we confirm that all identified viable regions are consistent with cosmological observations, and that the models exhibit different thermal history scenarios for the Universe. Our findings establish a multi-faceted discriminative framework: the IDM is characterized by a robust plateau and low fine-tuning, the MSSM by a sharp slepton-mediated annihilation dip, and the NMSSM by a diluted signature due to singlino admixture. The discovery of a heavy WIMP without sharp resonance features would therefore phenomenologically favor scalar doublet extensions over minimal supersymmetric frameworks.</description>

      <title>Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete. Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the ``effective mass" from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly crucial piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>The Entropic Skin: Spatial Entanglement from the QCD Confinement Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent investigations into High-Energy QCD have identified entanglement entropy as a crucial observable, linking parton distributions to the structure of the quantum vacuum. While momentum-space entanglement has been extensively studied in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), the spatial realization of this entanglement in confined systems remains an open question. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the confining boundary of the MIT Bag Model acts as an ``Entropic Skin,'' generating maximal Spin-Position entanglement. We calculate the local reduced density matrix for the confined quark and show that the linear boundary condition, $i \gamma^\mu n_\mu \psi = \psi$, acts as an entangling gate. The surface entropy density reaches a geometric invariant of $\approx 0.918$ bits ($92\%$ of the qubit limit), independent of the bag radius. We discuss the implications of this result for Chiral Symmetry breaking and propose that this boundary entropy is the precursor to the pion cloud in effective field theories.</description>

Abstract: Recently arXiv:2512.11011 set out to improve on previous work from 1994 by Dolgov and Freese, who used a small-angle approximation to derive the yield of spontaneous baryogenesis from a rolling phase, a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to the baryon current. The goal of the recent paper was to investigate what happens when the small-angle approximation is not imposed. I point out a serious technical shortcoming in their derivation.</description>

      <title>CT25: Progress toward next-generation PDFs for precision phenomenology at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize recent progress toward the next generation of CTEQ-TEA parton distribution functions, CT25, based on a global NNLO analysis that incorporates a significant sample of newly included LHC data. We present a baseline fit within the forthcoming full CT25 fit, which includes new Drell-Yan, top-pair, and inclusive-jet data at 8 and 13 TeV, and exhibits non-trivial pulls on the high-$x$ gluon and the flavor structure of the quark sea. In the context of progress toward CT25, we also summarize several recent and ongoing studies of the interplay between phenomenological PDFs and lattice-QCD calculations, simultaneous extractions of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ within the CT framework, and an expanded program of uncertainty quantification that treats parametrization dependence as an explicit source of epistemic uncertainty, among other issues. We also briefly highlight CT efforts to understand the effects of partial implementations of N$^3$LO corrections into PDF fits, which include benchmark calculations for Higgs and vector-boson processes. We comment on the implications of recent improvements to the CT analysis for precision phenomenology at the LHC and future facilities.</description>

      <title>How to identify the dead cone in the top-quark jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gluon emission from an energetic heavy quark is suppressed in the forward direction below the angle $\Theta\lesssim m_Q/E$ for a quark of mass $m_Q$ and energy $E$ according to perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) (``dead cone"). Another consequence is the suppression of energetic particles in the jet which has been observed already for c- and b-quark jets. The suppression of the forward particles can be explained by an application of the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of perturbative QCD. In this paper we investigate whether this type of analysis can be carried out also for top-quark jets with the much higher heavy quark mass allowing for QCD tests in this new kinematic regime. The new aspect of this analysis is the finite lifetime of the top quark. We consider for simplicity the decay $t\to b\ell\nu$, where the b-quark radiates gluons as well and partially obscures the dead cone. Guided by the decay amplitude in leading order in $\alpha_s$ for $e^+e^- \to t \bar t$ we propose a method to separate the radiation by the $\widehat{tb}$ dipole in the decay process which is superimposed to the primary radiation from the $\widehat{t \bar t}$ dipole involving the top-quark dead cone effect. The momentum distributions of partons or hadrons are determined for finite decay angles of the b-quark $\Theta_b$ and extrapolated into forward direction $\Theta_b=0$ where the radiation from the decay process is expected to vanish. This method is successfully tested at the parton level and results obtained for hadrons are compatible with the MLLA relation within an accuracy of around 15\%. Our calculations are carried out with the Pythia 8.3 Monte Carlo Event Generator.</description>

      <title>Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find no strong evidence for an extra mode; however, its inclusion modifies the inferred distribution of the remnant spin. This test will be applicable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.02 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.003 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes.</description>

      <title>Vector interaction bounds in NJL-like models from LQCD estimated curvature of the chiral crossover line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain improved bounds on both the flavor-independent and -dependent vector interactions in a $2+1$-flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model using the latest precise LQCD results of the curvature coefficients of the chiral crossover line. We find that these lattice estimated curvature coefficients allow for both attractive and repulsive types of interactions in both the cases. With this constrained ranges of vector interactions, we further predict the behavior of the second $(\kappa_2^B)$ and fourth $(\kappa_4^B)$ order curvature coefficients as a function of the strangeness chemical potential $(\mu_S)$. We observe that the flavor mixing effects, arising from the flavor-independent vector interaction as well as from the 't Hooft interaction, play an important role in $k_2^B$. We propose that the mixing effects due to the vector interaction can be separated from those arising from the 't Hooft interaction by analyzing the behavior of $k_2^B$ as a function of $\mu_S$. Finally, we locate the critical endpoint in the $T-\mu_B$ plane using the model-estimated ranges of vector interactions and find the model's predictions to be consistent with the latest LQCD bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical formalism for calculating first-order-in-opacity radiative energy loss that incorporates the spatial and temporal temperature evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a finite-size QCD medium with dynamical (i.e., moving) constituents. The derived expressions allow for arbitrary temperature profiles, enabling detailed evaluations of radiative energy loss across different medium-evolution scenarios. Importantly, the resulting kernel applies to both single partons (R = 0) and jets (R &gt; 0) via an out-of-cone selection, providing a unified starting point for precision QGP tomography.</description>

      <title>Impact of general relativistic accretion on primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} &gt; 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi&gt;1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Cut-off scale of quantum gravity as a sign to unify interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of gravity interaction with matter at one-loop level of effective quantum field theory naturally sets the cut-off scale $\Lambda_E$ in a sub-Planckian region through incorporating the gauge coupling constant $\alpha(\Lambda_E)$ and the reduced Planckian mass $\tilde m_\text{pl}$ into relation $ \Lambda_E\sim \tilde m_\text{pl}\,\alpha(\Lambda_E)/(4\pi)$ numerically yielding $\Lambda_E\sim 10^{16}$ GeV. Such two scales are empirically inherent for an inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Search for a photon peak from keV-scale dark matter annihilation with NuSTAR: Constraints on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ after 11 years of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.</description>

      <title>Plunge spectra as discriminators of black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.</description>

      <title>Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</description>

      <title>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to find reliable and efficient numerical approximation schemes, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of one-particle irreducible two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. Based on this reformulation and reinterpretation we adopt a numerical scheme for the solution of field-dependent flow equations as nonlinear partial differential equations. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more interesting problems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <title>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</description>
