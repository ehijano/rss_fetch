      <title>Equilibrium Mean-Variance Dividend Rate Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal dividend problem for a company that aims to maximize the mean-variance (MV) objective of the accumulated discounted dividend payments up to its ruin time. The MV objective involves an integral form over a random horizon that depends endogenously on the company's dividend strategy, and these features lead to a novel time-inconsistent control problem. To address the time inconsistency, we seek a time-consistent equilibrium dividend rate strategy. We first develop and prove a new verification lemma that characterizes the value function and equilibrium strategy by an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system. Next, we apply the verification lemma to obtain the equilibrium strategy and show that it is a barrier strategy for small levels of risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stochastic Collocation with Exponential Splines for an Arbitrage-Free Interpolation of Option Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the stochastic collocation method using the exponential of a quadratic spline. In particular, we look in details whether it is more appropriate to fix the ordinates and optimize the abscissae of an interpolating spline or to fix the abscissae and optimize the parameters of a B-spline representation.</description>

      <title>Quantformer: from attention to profit with a quantitative transformer trading strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional quantitative trading practice, navigating the complicated and dynamic financial market presents a persistent challenge. Fully capturing various market variables, including long-term information, as well as essential signals that may lead to profit remains a difficult task for learning algorithms. In order to tackle this challenge, this paper introduces quantformer, an enhanced neural network architecture based on transformer, to build investment factors. By transfer learning from sentiment analysis, quantformer not only exploits its original inherent advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and modeling complex data relationships, but is also able to solve tasks with numerical inputs and accurately forecast future returns over a given period. This work collects more than 5,000,000 rolling data of 4,601 stocks in the Chinese capital market from 2010 to 2023. The results of this study demonstrate the model's superior performance in predicting stock trends compared with other 100-factor-based quantitative strategies. Notably, the model's innovative use of transformer-like model to establish factors, in conjunction with market sentiment information, has been shown to enhance the accuracy of trading signals significantly, thereby offering promising implications for the future of quantitative trading strategies.</description>

      <title>A G-BSDE approach to the long-term decomposition of robust pricing kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a BSDE approach to the long-term decomposition of pricing kernels under the G-expectation framework. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to three types of quadratic G-BSDEs: finite-horizon G-BSDEs, infinite-horizon G-BSDEs, and ergodic G-BSDEs. Moreover, we explore the Feynman--Kac formula associated with these three types of quadratic G-BSDEs. Using these results, a pricing kernel is uniquely decomposed into four components: an exponential discounting component, a transitory component, a symmetric G-martingale, and a decreasing component that captures the volatility uncertainty of the G-Brownian motion. Furthermore, these components are represented through the solution to a second-order PDE. This study extends previous findings obtained under a single fixed probability framework to the G-expectation context.</description>

      <title>Marketron Through the Looking Glass: From Equity Dynamics to Option Pricing in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marketron model, introduced by [Halperin, Itkin, 2025], describes price formation in inelastic markets as the nonlinear diffusion of a quasiparticle (the marketron) in a multidimensional space comprising the log-price $x$, a memory variable $y$ encoding past money flows, and unobservable return predictors $z$. While the original work calibrated the model to S\&amp;P 500 time series data, this paper extends the framework to option markets - a fundamentally distinct challenge due to market incompleteness stemming from non-tradable state variables. We develop a utility-based pricing approach that constructs a risk-adjusted measure via the dual solution of an optimal investment problem. The resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, though computationally formidable, is solved using a novel methodology enabling efficient calibration even on standard laptop hardware. Having done that, we look at the additional question to answer: whether the Marketron model, calibrated to market option prices, can simultaneously reproduce the statistical properties of the underlying asset's log-returns. We discuss our results in view of the long-standing challenge in quantitative finance of developing an unified framework capable of jointly capturing equity returns, option smile dynamics, and potentially volatility index behavior.</description>
