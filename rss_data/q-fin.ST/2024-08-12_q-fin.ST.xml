      <title>Lower bounds of uncertainty and upper limits on the accuracy of forecasts of macroeconomic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the randomness of values and volumes of market deals as a major factor that describes lower bounds of uncertainty and upper limits on the accuracy of the forecasts of macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns. We introduce random macroeconomic variables, whose average values coincide with usual macroeconomic variables, and describe their uncertainty by coefficients of variation that depend on the volatilities, correlations, and coefficients of variation of random values or volumes of trades. The same approach describes bounds of uncertainty and limits on the accuracy of forecasts for growth rates, inflation, interest rates, etc. Limits on the accuracy of forecasts of macroeconomic variables depend on the certainty of predictions of their probabilities. The number of predicted statistical moments determines the veracity of macroeconomic probability. To quantify macroeconomic 2nd statistical moments, one needs additional econometric methodologies, data, and calculations of variables determined as sums of squares of values or volumes of market trades. Forecasting of macroeconomic 2nd statistical moments requires 2nd order economic theories. All of that is absent and for many years to come, the accuracy of forecasts of the probabilities of random macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns will be limited by the Gaussian approximations, which are determined by the first two statistical moments.</description>

      <title>HybridRAG: Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Vector Retrieval Augmented Generation for Efficient Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraction and interpretation of intricate information from unstructured text data arising in financial applications, such as earnings call transcripts, present substantial challenges to large language models (LLMs) even using the current best practices to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (referred to as VectorRAG techniques which utilize vector databases for information retrieval) due to challenges such as domain specific terminology and complex formats of the documents. We introduce a novel approach based on a combination, called HybridRAG, of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) based RAG techniques (called GraphRAG) and VectorRAG techniques to enhance question-answer (Q&amp;A) systems for information extraction from financial documents that is shown to be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant answers. Using experiments on a set of financial earning call transcripts documents which come in the form of Q&amp;A format, and hence provide a natural set of pairs of ground-truth Q&amp;As, we show that HybridRAG which retrieves context from both vector database and KG outperforms both traditional VectorRAG and GraphRAG individually when evaluated at both the retrieval and generation stages in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer generation. The proposed technique has applications beyond the financial domain</description>

      <title>Efficient Asymmetric Causality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric causality tests are increasingly gaining popularity in different scientific fields. This approach corresponds better to reality since logical reasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical investigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via partial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables operating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the residuals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the ordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient. Additionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal parameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to assess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically significant, but also if their difference is statistically significant. Consequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should explicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The purpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An application is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the asymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide are efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.</description>
