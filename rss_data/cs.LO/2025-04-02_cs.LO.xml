      <title>Logical perspectives on learning statistical objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between learnability of a ``base class'' of functions on a set X and learnability of a class of statistical functions derived from the base class. For example, we refine results showing that learnability of a family of functions implies learnability of the family of functions mapping a function in the class to its expectation under a distribution. We will look at both Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, where example inputs and outputs are chosen at random, and online learning, where the examples are chosen adversarially. We establish improved bounds on the sample complexity of learning for statistical classes, stated in terms of combinatorial dimensions of the base class. We do this by adapting techniques introduced in model theory for ``randomizing a structure''. We give particular attention to classes derived from logical formulas, and relate learnability of the statistical classes to properties of the formula. Finally, we provide bounds on the complexity of learning the statistical classes built on top of a logic-based hypothesis class.</description>

      <title>GOL in GOL in HOL: Verified Circuits in Conway's Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life (GOL) is a cellular automaton that has captured the interest of hobbyists and mathematicians alike for more than 50 years. The Game of Life is Turing complete, and people have been building increasingly sophisticated constructions within GOL, such as 8-bit displays, Turing machines, and even an implementation of GOL itself. In this paper, we report on a project to build an implementation of GOL within GOL, via logic circuits, fully formally verified within the HOL4 theorem prover. This required a combination of interactive tactic proving, symbolic simulation, and semi-automated forward proof to assemble the components into an infinite circuit which can calculate the next step of the simulation while respecting signal propagation delays. The result is a verified "GOL in GOL compiler" which takes an initial GOL state and returns a mega-cell version of it that can be passed to off-the-shelf GOL simulators, such as Golly. We believe these techniques are also applicable to other cellular automata, as well as for hardware verification which takes into account both the physical configuration of components and wire delays.</description>

      <title>SAT problem and Limit of Solomonoff's inductive reasoning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) in the context of Kolmogorov complexity theory. We present three versions of the distinguishability problem-Boolean formulas, Turing machines, and quantum systems-each focused on distinguishing between two Bernoulli distributions induced by these computational models. A reduction is provided that establishes the equivalence between the Boolean formula version of the program output statistical prediction problem and the #SAT problem. Furthermore, we apply Solomonoff's inductive reasoning theory, revealing its limitations: the only "algorithm" capable of determining the output of any shortest program is the program itself, and any other algorithms are computationally indistinguishable from a universal computer, based on the coding theorem. The quantum version of this problem introduces a unique algorithm based on statistical distance and distinguishability, reflecting a fundamental limit in quantum mechanics. Finally, the potential equivalence of Kolmogorov complexity between circuit models and Turing machines may have significant implications for the NP vs P problem. We also investigate the nature of short programs corresponding to exponentially long bit sequences that can be compressed, revealing that these programs inherently contain loops that grow exponentially.</description>

      <title>Complex event recognition under time constraints: towards a formal framework for efficient query evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies Complex Event Recognition (CER) under time constraints regarding its query language, computational models, and streaming evaluation algorithms. We start by introducing an extension of Complex Event Logic (CEL), called timed CEL, with simple time operators. We show that timed CEL aids in modeling CER query languages in practice, serving as a proxy to study the expressive power of such languages under time constraints. For this purpose, we introduce an automata model for studying timed CEL, called timed Complex Event Automata (timed CEA). This model extends the existing CEA model with clocks, combining CEA and timed automata in a single model. We show that timed CEL and timed CEA are equally expressive, giving the first characterization of CER query languages under time constraints. Then, we move towards understanding the efficient evaluation of timed CEA over streams concerning its determinization and efficient algorithms. We present a class of timed CEA that are closed under determinization; furthermore, we show that this class contains swg-queries, an expressive class of CER queries recently introduced by Kleest-Meissner et al. Finally, we present a streaming evaluation algorithm with constant update time and output-linear delay for evaluating deterministic monotonic timed CEA with a single clock, which have only less equal or greater equal comparisons.</description>

      <title>1-2-3-Go! Policy Synthesis for Parameterized Markov Decision Processes via Decision-Tree Learning and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the advances in probabilistic model checking, the scalability of the verification methods remains limited. In particular, the state space often becomes extremely large when instantiating parameterized Markov decision processes (MDPs) even with moderate values. Synthesizing policies for such \emph{huge} MDPs is beyond the reach of available tools. We propose a learning-based approach to obtain a reasonable policy for such huge MDPs.
  The idea is to generalize optimal policies obtained by model-checking small instances to larger ones using decision-tree learning. Consequently, our method bypasses the need for explicit state-space exploration of large models, providing a practical solution to the state-space explosion problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by performing extensive experimentation on the relevant models from the quantitative verification benchmark set. The experimental results indicate that our policies perform well, even when the size of the model is orders of magnitude beyond the reach of state-of-the-art analysis tools.</description>
