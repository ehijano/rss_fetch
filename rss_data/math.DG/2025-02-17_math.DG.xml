      <title>Topological and geometric rigidity of nonnegatively curved submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topology and geometry of compact submanifolds in space forms of nonnegative curvature that satisfy a lower bound on the sectional curvature, depending only on the length of the mean curvature vector of the immersion. We show that this condition imposes strong constraints on either the topology or geometry of the submanifold. Additionally, we provide examples that demonstrate the sharpness of our result.</description>

      <title>A formula for the k-th covariant derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to give a formula for the $k$-th covariant derivative of tensor field along a given curve. In order to do that, first the symbols $P^{i&lt;k&gt;}_{j}$ and $Q^{i&lt;k&gt;}_{j}$ which depend on the Christoffel symbols are introduced. Some properties of them are also given. The main result is given by (3.1) and further it is generalized for $k\in R$.</description>

      <title>3-Manifolds with positive scalar curvature and bounded geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a complete contractible 3-manifold with positive scalar curvature and bounded geometry must be $\mathbb R^3$. We also show that an open handlebody of genus larger than 1 does not admit complete metrics with positive scalar curvature and bounded geometry. Our results rely on the maximal weak solution to inverse mean curvature flow due to the third-named author.</description>

      <title>Contact de Rham cohomology and Hodge structures transversal to the Reeb foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\beta$ be a contact form on a compact smooth manifold $X$ and $v_\beta$ its Reeb vector field. The paper applies general results of different authors about Hodge structures that are transversal to a given foliation to the special case of $1$-dimensional foliation generated by the Reeb flow $v_\beta$. Theses applications are available for the Reeb flows on {\sf closed} manifolds $X$. In contrast, for the Reeb flows on manifolds with boundary, little is known about the Hodge structures transversal to the $v_\beta$-flow. We are trying to fill in this gap.\smallskip
  The de Rham differential complex $\Omega_{\mathsf b}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$ of, so called, {\sf basic} relative to $v_\beta$-flow differential forms is in the focus of this investigation. By definition, the basic forms vanish when being contracted with $v_\beta$, and so do their differentials.
  In particular, we investigate when the $2$-form $d\beta$ and its powers deliver nontrivial elements in the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ of the differential complex $\Omega_{\mathsf b}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$. Answers to these questions seem to contrast sharply the cases of a closed $X$ and a $X$ with boundary. %we prove that when a $v_\beta$-flow admits a Lyapunov function, then the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ of the complex $\Omega_{\mathsf b}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$ are topological invariants of $X$.
  On the other hand, building on work of Ra\'{z}ny \cite{Raz}, we show that on closed manifolds, equipped with a transversal to the Reeb flow Hodge structure that satisfies the {\sf Basic Hard Lefschetz property}, the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ are topological invariants of $X$.</description>

      <title>On K\"ahler-Einstein Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a general class of singular K\"ahler metrics with Ricci curvature bounded below define K\"ahler currents. In particular the result applies to singular K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on klt pairs, and an analogous result holds for K\"ahler-Ricci solitons. In addition we show that if a singular K\"ahler-Einstein metric can be approximated by smooth metrics on a resolution whose Ricci curvature has negative part that is bounded uniformly in $L^p$ for $p &gt; \frac{2n-1}{n}$, then the metric defines an RCD space.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of the Schwarzian derivative on long complex projective tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwarzian derivative parametrizes the fibres of the space of complex projective structures on a surface as vector bundle over its Teichm\"uller space. We study its behaviour on long complex projective tubes, and get estimates for the pairing of its real part with infinitesimal earthquakes and graftings. As the real part of their Schwarzian coincides with the differential of the renormalized volume we obtain bounds for the variation of renormalized volume under complex earthquake paths, and its asymptotic behaviour under pinching a compressible curve.</description>

      <title>Area estimates for capillary cmc hypersurfaces with nonpositive Yamabe invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove area estimates for stable capillary $cmc$ (minimal) hypersurfaces $\Sigma$ with nonpositive Yamabe invariant that are properly immersed in a Riemannian $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ with scalar curvature $R^M$ and mean curvature of the boundary $H^{\partial M}$ bounded from below. We also prove a local rigidity result in the case $\Sigma$ is embedded and $\mathcal{J}$-energy-minimizing. In this case, we show that $M$ locally splits along $\Sigma$ and is isometric to $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\times \Sigma, dt^2 + e^{-2Ht}g)$, where $g$ is Einstein, or Ricci flat, $H\geq 0$ and $\partial\Sigma$ is totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>Large topology asymptotics for spectrally extremal minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{B}^3$ and $\mathbb{S}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work with Kusner, we developed a method, based on the equivariant optimization of Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues, for producing minimal surfaces of prescribed topology in low-dimensional balls and spheres. We used the method to construct many new minimal embeddings in $\mathbb{S}^3$ with area below $8\pi$, and many new free boundary minimal embeddings in $\mathbb{B}^3$ with area below $2\pi$. In this paper, we study the geometry of these surfaces in more detail, with an emphasis on studying sharp area estimates and varifold limits in the large Euler characteristic regime. This allows us to confirm some well-known conjectures regarding the space of low-area minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ in this class of examples and the special role played by Lawson's $\xi_{\gamma,1}$ surfaces. We also confirm analogous statements in $\mathbb{B}^3$ and identify a family of free boundary minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{B}^3$ most closely resembling $\xi_{\gamma,1}$.</description>

      <title>Lie algebras of quotient groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give conditions on a diffeological group $G$ and a normal subgroup $H$ under which the quotient group $G/H$ differentiates to a Lie algebra, and $\operatorname{Lie}(G/H) \cong \operatorname{Lie}(G)/\operatorname{Lie}(H)$. Our Lie functor is derived from the tangent structure on elastic diffeological spaces introduced by Blohmann. The requisite conditions on $G$ and $H$ hold when $G$ is a convenient infinite-dimensional Lie group and all iterated tangent bundles $T^kH$ are initial subgroups of $T^kG$; in particular, $G$ may be finite-dimensional, or $H$ may be countable. As an application, we integrate some classically non-integrable Banach-Lie algebras to diffeological groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a characterization of naturally reductive 2-step nilponent Lie groups via Ambrose-Singer's homogeneous structures to prove that one cannot determine if a closed Riemannian manifold is naturally reductive using the information encoded in the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. To do that, we consider a new isospectral pair of 2-step nilmanifolds of dimension 9 such that one of them is naturally reductive and the other is not.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Efficiency and Comparison of Different Numerical Differentiation Methods on Three Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Without question regarding its pivotal significance, the computation of function derivatives carries substantial weight within a multitude of engineering and applied mathematical fields. These encompass optimization, the development of nonlinear control systems, and the assessment of noisy time signals, among others. In this study, we have chosen three illustrative cases: the logistic model for population dynamics, temperature variation within buildings, and the determination of market equilibrium prices. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of various numerical differentiation techniques and conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes for each of these case studies. To achieve this objective, we employed three distinct numerical differentiation techniques: The Forward, Backward, and Centered FiniteDifference methods, each executed in two different levels of precision, totaling six variations. Our findings clearly indicate that, for the initial case study, the methods characterized by lower computational costs (specifically, the Forward and Backward Finite-Difference methods) yield superior outcomes. In contrast, for the second case study, the Centered Finite-Difference method delivers better results. In the case of the third case study, our results reveal that none of the methods produce estimations that meet acceptable standards. It is noteworthy that the empirical equations for each case study have been validated against previous literature.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Estimation Accuracy of 5 Different Numerical ODE Solvers on 3 Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers are indispensable tools in various engineering domains, enabling the simulation and analysis of dynamic systems. In this work, we utilize 5 different numerical ODE solvers namely: Euler's method, Heun's method, Midpoint Method, Runge-kutta 4th order and ODE45 method in order to discover the answer of three wellknown case studies and compare their results by calculation of relative errors. To check for the validity of the estimations, the experimental data of previous literature have been compared with the data in this paper which shows a good accordance. We observe that for each of the case studies based on the behavior of the model, the estimation accuracy of the solvers is different. For the logistic population change as the first case study, the results of all solvers are so close to each other that only their solution cost can be considered for their superiority. For temperature change of a building as the second case study we see that in some especial areas the accuracy of the solvers is different and in general Midpoint ODE solver shows better results. As the last case study, market equilibrium price shows that none of the numerical ODE solvers can estimate its behavior which is due to its sudden changing nature.</description>

      <title>Euclidean distance degree in manifold optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Euclidean distance degrees of the three most common manifolds arising in manifold optimization: flag, Grassmann, and Stiefel manifolds. For the Grassmannian, we will also determine the Euclidean distance degree of an important class of Schubert varieties that often appear in applications. Our technique goes further than furnishing the value of the Euclidean distance degree; it will also yield closed-form expressions for all stationary points of the Euclidean distance function in each instance. We will discuss the implications of these results on the tractability of manifold optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Translating Solitons to a Lagrangian mean curvature flow with zero Maslov class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there is no a Type I singularity for the Lagrangian mean curvature flow with zero Maslov class. In this paper, we study translating solitons which are important models of Type II singularities. A necessary condition for a blow-up limit arising at a Type II singularity of a Lagrangian mean curvature flow with zero Maslov class is provided. As an application, we try to understand the important open question proposed by Joyce-Lee-Tsui and Neves-Tian, whether the Lagrangian translating solitons constructed by Joyce-Lee-Tsui can be a blow-up limit for a Lagrangian mean curvature flow with zero Maslov class.</description>

      <title>Hypoelliptic entropy dissipation for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00544v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence analysis for general degenerate and non-reversible stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We apply the Lyapunov method to analyze the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the Lyapunov functional is chosen as a weighted relative Fisher information functional. We derive a structure condition and formulate the Lyapunov constant explicitly. We prove the exponential convergence result for the probability density function towards its invariant distribution in the $L_1$ distance. Two examples are presented: underdamped Langevin dynamics with variable diffusion matrices and three oscillator chain models with nearest-neighbor couplings.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations for Lagrangian systems and geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we shall use the abstract bifurcation theorems developed by the author in previous papers to study bifurcations of solutions for Lagrangian systems on manifolds linearly or nonlinearly dependent on parameters under various boundary value conditions. As applications, many bifurcation results for geodesics on Finsler and Riemannian manifolds are derived.</description>

      <title>Monotone Sequences of Metric Spaces with Compact Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a fixed metric space (possibly an oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary) with an increasing sequence of distance functions and a uniform upper bound on diameter. When the metric space endowed with the pointwise limit of these distances is compact, then there is uniform and Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence to this limit. When the metric space also has an integral current structure of uniformly bounded total mass (as is true for an oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary that has a uniform bound on total volume), we prove volume preserving intrinsic flat convergence to a subset of the GH limit whose closure is the whole GH limit. We provide a review of all notions and have a list of open questions at the end. Dedicated to Xiaochun Rong.</description>

      <title>CR Paneitz operator on non-embeddable CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CR Paneitz operator is closely related to some important problems in CR geometry. In this paper, we consider this operator on a non-embeddable CR manifold. This operator is essentially self-adjoint and its spectrum is discrete except zero. Moreover, the eigenspace corresponding to each non-zero eigenvalue is a finite dimensional subspace of the space of smooth functions. Furthermore, we show that the CR Paneitz operator on the Rossi sphere, an example of non-embeddable CR manifolds, has infinitely many negative eigenvalues, which is significantly different from the embeddable case.</description>

      <title>On extensions of Frobenius-K\"ahler and Sasakian Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensions of Lie algebras equipped with Sasakian or Frobenius-K\"ahler geometrical structures are studied. Conditions are given so that a double extension of a Sasakian Lie algebra be Sasakian again. Conditions are also given for obtaining either a Sasakian or a Frobernius-K\"ahler Lie algebra upon respectively extending a Frobernius-K\"ahler or a Sasakian Lie algebra by adjoining a derivation of the source algebra. Low-dimensional examples are included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct for each conformal structure on a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2 a proper slice in the character variety of representations of the associated surface group into SL(3,R) that belongs to the Barbot component and show that the corresponding representations are Borel Anosov. We describe a fibered geometric structure in the space of full flags associated with these representations.</description>
