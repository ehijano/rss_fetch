      <title>Quillen's Fundamental Spectral Sequences Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quillen's fundamental spectral sequences relate Andr\'{e}-Quillen homology and cohomology to Tor and Ext functors. The five-term exact sequences arising from these spectral sequences are leveraged to characterize regular and complete intersection local rings. Despite their immense importance in the theory of Andr\'{e}-Quillen homology and cohomology, these spectral sequences are not treated in the literature as they merit. A sketchy argument with gaps for a special case of the first spectral sequence appears in an unpublished manuscript of Quillen, while the second spectral sequence is only stated without proof in another paper of Quillen. A rigorous proof of the spectral sequences requires a delicate investigation of the subtle structures involved. The goal of this expository article is to present a comprehensive and detailed proof of Quillen's fundamental spectral sequences in a readable and well-structured manner.</description>

Abstract: Let $I_{n,m} = (x_1\cdots x_{m},x_2 \cdots x_{m+1},\ldots,x_{n+1}x_{n+2}\cdots x_{n+m})$ be the $m$-path ideal of a path of length $n + m-1$ over a polynomial ring $S = \mathrm{k}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+m}]$. We compute all the graded Betti numbers of all powers of $I_{n,m}$.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretical Approach to Ring Analysis: An Exploration of Dominant Metric Dimension in Compressed Zero Divisor Graphs and Its Interplay with Ring Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper systematically classifies rings based on the dominant metric dimensions (Ddim) of their associated CZDG, establishing consequential bounds for the Ddim of these compressed zero-divisor graphs. The authors investigate the interplay between the ring-theoretic properties of a ring ( R ) and associated CZDG. An undirected graph consisting of vertex set ( Z(R_E)\{[0]}\ =\ R_E\{[0],[1]}), where ( R_E=\{[x]:\ x\in R\} ) and ([x]=\{y\in R:\ \text{ann}(x)=\text{ann}(y)\} ) is called a compressed zero-divisor graph, denoted by ( \Gamma_E(R) ). An edge is formed between two vertices ([x]) and ([y]) of ( Z(R_E) ) if and only if ([x][y]=[xy]=[0]), that is, iff ( xy=0 ). For a ring ( R ), graph ( G ) is said to be realizable as ( \Gamma_E(R) ) if ( G ) is isomorphic to ( \Gamma_E(R) ). Moreover, an exploration into the Ddim of realizable graphs for rings is conducted, complemented by illustrative examples reinforcing the presented results. A recent discussion within the paper elucidates the nuanced relationship between Ddim, diameter, and girth within the domain of compressed zero-divisor graphs. This research offers a comprehensive and insightful analysis at the intersection of algebraic structures and graph theory, providing valuable contributions to the current mathematical discourse.</description>

      <title>Blow-up rings and $F$-rationality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove some sufficient conditions for Cohen-Macaulay normal Rees algebras to be $F$-rational. Let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a Gorenstein normal local domain of dimension $d\geq 2$ and of characteristic $p &gt; 0$. Let $I$ be a $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal. Our first set of results give conditions on the test ideals $\tau(I^n)$, $n \geq 1$ which would imply that the normalization of the Rees algebra $R[It]$ is $F$-rational. Another sufficient condition is that the socle of $\mathrm{H}_{\overline{G}_+}^d(\overline{G})$ (where $\overline{G}$ is the associated graded ring for the integral closure filtration) is entirely in degree $-1$, if $R$ is $F$-rational (but not necessarily Gorenstein). Then we show that if $R$ is a hypersurface of degree $2$ or is three-dimensional and $F$-rational, and $\mathrm{Proj} (R[\mathfrak{m} t ])$ is $F$-rational, then $R[\mathfrak{m} t ]$ is $F$-rational.</description>

      <title>A general formula for the index of depth stability of edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a classical result of Brodmann, the function $\operatorname{depth} R/I^t$ is asymptotically a constant, i.e. there is a number $s$ such that $\operatorname{depth} R/I^t = \operatorname{depth} R/I^s$ for $t &gt; s$. One calls the smallest number $s$ with this property the index of depth stability of $I$ and denotes it by $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$. This invariant remains mysterious til now. The main result of this paper gives an explicit formula for $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$ when $I$ is an arbitrary ideal generated by squarefree monomials of degree 2. That is the first general case where one can characterize $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$ explicitly. The formula expresses $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$ in terms of the associated graph. The proof involves new techniques which relate different topics such as simplicial complexes, systems of linear inequalities, graph parallelizations, and ear decompositions. It provides an effective method for the study of powers of edge ideals.</description>

      <title>Regularity functions of powers of graded ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of which sequences of non-negative integers arise as the functions $\operatorname{reg} I^{n-1}/I^n$, $\operatorname{reg} R/I^n$, $\operatorname{reg} I^n$ for an ideal $I$ generated by forms of degree $d$ in a standard graded algebra $R$. These functions are asymptotically linear with slope $d$. If $\dim R/I = 0$, we give a complete characterization of all numerical functions which arise as the functions $\operatorname{reg} I^{n-1}/I^n$, $\operatorname{reg} R/I^n$ and show that $\operatorname{reg} I^n$ can be any numerical function $f(n) \ge dn$ that weakly decreases until it becomes a linear function with slope $d$. The latter result gives a negative answer to a question of Eisenbud and Ulrich. If $\dim R/I \ge 1$, we show that $\operatorname{reg} I^{n-1}/I^n$ can be any numerical asymptotically linear function $f(n) \ge dn-1$ with slope $d$ and $\operatorname{reg} R/I^n$ can be any numerical asymptotically linear function $f(n) \ge dn-1$ with slope $d$ that is weakly increasing. Inspired of a recent work of Ein, Ha and Lazarsfeld on non-singular complex projective schemes, we also prove that the function of the saturation degree of $I^n$ is asymptotically linear for an arbitrary graded ideal $I$ and study the behavior of this function.</description>

      <title>On modules whose dual is of finite Gorenstein dimension: The $k$-torsion, homological criteria, and applications in modules of differentials of order $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to obtain some results under the condition that the dual of a module has finite Gorenstein dimension. In this direction we derive results involving vanishing of Ext as well as the freeness or totally reflexivity of modules. For instance, we provide a generalization of a celebrated theorem by Evans and Griffith, obtain criteria for the totally reflexivity of modules over Cohen-Macaulay rings as well as of modules locally totally reflexive on the punctured spectrum, and recover a result by Araya. Moreover, we prove that the Auslander-Reiten conjecture holds true for all finitely generated modules $M$ over a Noetherian local ring $R$ such that $\operatorname{G-dim}_R(\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,R))&lt;\infty$ and $\operatorname{pd}_R(\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,M))&lt;\infty$. Additionally, we derive Gorenstein criteria under the condition that the dual of certain modules is of finite Gorenstein dimension. Furthermore, we explore some applications in the theory of the modules of K\"ahler differentials of order $n\geq 1$, specifically concerning the $k$-torsionfreeness of these modules and the Herzog-Vasconcelos's conjecture.</description>

      <title>PolyominoIdeals: a package for Macaulay2 to work with the inner $2$-minor ideals of collections of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a collection of cells and $I_\mathcal{P}$ be the associated ideal of inner $2$-minors as defined by A. A. Qureshi in 2012. In this paper, we provide a description of the package $\texttt{PolyominoIdeals}$ for the computer algebra software $\texttt{Macaulay2}$. More precisely, this package provides some functions that allow to define the ideal $I_{\mathcal{P}}$ in $\texttt{Macaulay2}$ and to compute its algebraic invariants or verifying its algebraic properties. We explain the usage of these functions and also give some examples. Refer to the tool provided in $\textit{https://rizwan.phd/polyo/}$ to get easier the desired input data for $\texttt{Macaulay2}$.</description>

      <title>Strolling through common meadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meadows are a sort of commutative rings with a multiplicative identity element and a total multiplicative inverse operation. In this paper we study algebraic properties of common meadows, which are meadows that introduce, as the inverse of zero, an error term $\abf$ which is absorbent for addition. We show that common meadows are unions of rings which are ordered by a partial order that defines a lattice. These results allow us to generalize some classical algebraic constructions to the setting of common meadows. We also briefly consider common meadows from a categorical perspective.</description>
