      <title>Investigating and improving student understanding of the basics of quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) is a rapidly developing field that leverages the skills of experts from many disciplines to utilize the potential of quantum systems in a variety of applications. It requires talent from a wide variety of traditional fields, including physics, engineering, chemistry, and computer science, to name a few. To prepare students for such opportunities, it is important to give them a strong foundation in the basics of QISE, in which quantum computing plays a central role. In this study, we discuss the development, validation, and evaluation of a QuILT, or Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial, on the basics and applications of quantum computing. These include an overview of key quantum mechanical concepts relevant for quantum computation (including ways a quantum computer is different from a classical computer), properties of single- and multi-qubit systems, and the basics of single-qubit quantum gates. The tutorial uses guided inquiry-based teaching-learning sequences. Its development and validation involved conducting cognitive task analysis from both expert and student perspectives and using common student difficulties as a guide. The inquiry-based learning sequences in the tutorial provide scaffolding support to help students develop a functional understanding. The final version of the validated tutorial was implemented in two distinct courses offered by the physics department with slightly different student populations and broader course goals. Students' understanding was evaluated after traditional lecture-based instruction on the requisite concepts, and again after engaging with the tutorial. We analyze and discuss their improvement in performance on concepts covered in the tutorial.</description>

      <title>Measurement of electromagnetic radiation force using a capacitance interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometry forms the cornerstone of several high-precision sensing techniques in physics. We present a mechanical cantilever-based tabletop interferometer to measure the force exerted by light from a pulsed laser beam. The experiment uses the interference of two sinusoidal voltage signals passing through nominally similar dielectrics formed by two cantilever-based air capacitors on a PCB. The radiation force exerted by a pulsed laser beam on one of the air capacitors causes a change in its capacitance, which is measured as a proportional change in the interfering voltage signal. This experiment uses equipment commonly found in an undergraduate teaching laboratory for physics and electronics while providing excellent insight into electromagnetic wave theory, circuit design for low-noise measurements, Fourier analysis, and interpretation of experimental data.</description>
