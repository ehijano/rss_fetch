      <title>Phase-dependent damping rate of Josephson plasmons in the nonequilibrium steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the damping rate of Josephson plasmons due to thermally excited quasiparticles in a nonequilibrium steady state. It is known that the experimentally observed dependence of the damping rate on the phase difference behaves in the opposite way to that of theory. It is shown that this problem can be solved by calculating the damping rate by incorporating changes in the electronic state at the resonant frequency. When the phase difference is large, the broadening of the one-particle state is large due to the presence of a dc current and brings about the effective thermalization, so that the nonequilibrium correction becomes small. Conversely, when the phase difference is small, the nonequilibrium correction becomes large and causes a smaller damping rate due to a reduction in the effective temperature. This dependence of the nonequilibrium correction on the phase difference results in a damping rate that is consistent with experimental results.</description>

      <title>p-wave superconductivity induced by nearest-neighbor attraction in the square-lattice extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is widely believed to contain the key ingredients of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials. Here, we report a constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) study of the square-lattice extended Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb repulsion U and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron attraction V. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.125, we find that the NN electron attraction V can notably drive an exotic spin-triplet (p-wave) superconducting (SC) phase, and enhance the p-wave SC correlations with the increase of V. But in the intermediate coupling regime, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (d-wave) does not significantly increase with the increase of V, indicating that the d-wave is not affected by V in strongly correlated system. Besides the pairing phase, a spin density wave (SDW) only exists near the half-filling in the particle-hole channel, and doping disrupts the formation of SDW order. Especially, the NN electron attraction V has no significant effect on SDW, reflecting the consistent relationship between d-wave SC and spin correlation. Moreover, as doping increases, the dominant region of p-wave also expands, further suppressing the presence of d-wave, which may help explain the disappearance of d-wave SC in overdoped cuprate superconductors. We also find the d-wave exhibits a singular nonzero (near point ($2{\pi}/3, {\pi}$)) condensation structure in momentum space, resulting in a different staggered behavior in the x and y direction with distance in real space. On the contrary, the p-wave condensed at zero momentum, and the p-wave correlation exhibits exponential decay in real space. Our work suggests the p-wave SC region can be induced and further broadened by the NN electron attraction V, offering a feasible mechanism to realize p-wave superconductivity in realistic cuprate materials.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection for MnTe altermagnet candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study electron transport across a single planar junction between the indium electrode and MnTe altermagnet candidate. We confirm standard Ohmic behavior with strictly linear current-voltage curves above the indium critical field or temperature, although with high, about 100~kOhm, junction resistance. At low temperatures and in zero magnetic field, we observe a well-developed Andreev curve with the pronounced coherence peaks, which cannot be normally expected for these high values of normal junction resistance. The conclusion on the Andreev reflection is also supported by suppression in magnetic field, as well as by universality of the observed behavior for all of the investigated samples. The experimental results can be explained by specifics of Andreev transport through the disordered region at the superconductor-altermagnet interface. Due to a different set of restrictions on the possibility of Andreev reflection, an altermagnet suffers from the presence of disorder less than a normal spin-degenerate metal, so the conductance enhancement is retained throughout the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations in superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum conductors attached to metallic reservoirs have been demonstrated to overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), a trade-off relation between the amount of dissipation and the absence of charge and heat current fluctuations. Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting reservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport processes, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their retro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal quasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns. The large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative and highly stable quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements in dissipation control have yielded significant insights into non-hermitian Hamiltonians for open quantum systems. Of particular interest are the topological characteristics exhibited by these non-hermitian systems, that arise from exceptional points - distinct degeneracies unique to such systems. In this study, we focus on Andreev bound states in multiterminal Josephson junctions with non-hermiticity induced by normal metal or ferromagnetic leads. By investigating several systems of different synthetic dimensions and symmetries, we predict fragile and stable non-hermitian topological phases in these engineered superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Engineered Josephson diode effect in kinked Rashba nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect, reminiscent of the unidirectional charge transport in semiconductor diodes, is characterized by a nonreciprocal, dissipationless flow of Cooper pairs. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the interplay between symmetry constraints and the inherent quantum behavior of superconductors. Here, we explore the geometric control of the diode effect in a kinked nanostrip Josephson junction based on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEGs) with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the diode effect as a function of the kink angle and the out-of-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram, showcasing a geometry and field-controlled diode effect. The phase diagram also reveals the presence of an anomalous Josephson effect related to the emergence of trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states, which can evolve into Majorana bound states. Our findings indicate that the exceptional synergy between geometric control of the diode effect and topological phases can be effectively leveraged to design and optimize superconducting devices with tailored transport properties.</description>

      <title>Entangled Photon Generation through Cooper Pair Recombination in a Noncentrosymmetric Quantum Well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore theoretically the generation of entangled two-photon pairs by Cooper pair recombination in a noncentrosymmetric [001]-quantum well superconductor, driven by a forward-biased p-n junction with a superconducting layer which exhibits admixture Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that the highest achievable purity of entangled photon pairs emerges within scenarios involving pure singlet Cooper pairs, specifically, the conventional $s$-wave gap function. Our results highlight the importance of minimizing the charge-carrier level concentration and balancing the magnitudes of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings to achieve entangled states with enhanced purity, which can be realized by reducing the amplitudes of antisymmetric spin-orbit couplings. In addition to purity concerns, to explore the distribution of two-photon states, we compare their population across entangled pairs for potential superconducting pairings.</description>

      <title>Low loss hybrid Nb/Au superconducting resonators for quantum circuit applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SupeSuperconducting resonators play a crucial role in developing forthcoming quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a niobium circuit with a 10 nm gold capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies. Among others, the presence of gold allows anchoring alkyl thiol groups to form self-assembled monolayers, improving the integration with molecular spin qubits for the development of hybrid quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Crystal-symmetry-paired spin-valley locking in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical efforts predicted a type of unconventional antiferromagnet characterized by the crystal symmetry C (rotation or mirror), which connects antiferromagnetic sublattices in real space and simultaneously couples spin and momentum in reciprocal space. This results in a unique C-paired spin-valley locking (SVL) and corresponding novel properties such as piezomagnetism and noncollinear spin current even without spin-orbit coupling. However, the unconventional antiferromagnets reported thus far are not layered materials, limiting their potential in spintronic applications. Additionally, they do not meet the necessary symmetry requirements for nonrelativistic spin current. Here, we report the realization of C-paired SVL in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnetic compound, Rb1-{\delta}V2Te2O. Spin resolved photoemission measurements directly demonstrate the opposite spin splitting between C-paired valleys. Quasi-particle interference patterns reveal the suppression of inter-valley scattering due to the spin selection rules, as a direct consequence of C-paired SVL. All these experiments are well consistent with the results obtained from first-principles calculations. Our observations represent the first realization of layered antiferromagnets with C-paired SVL, enabling both the advantages of layered materials and possible control through crystal symmetry manipulation. These results hold significant promise and broad implications for advancements in magnetism, electronics, and information technology.</description>

We constrain the E\"otv\"os parameter with 95%-confidence to $\eta_{\text{Nb*-Cu}}~\leq~2.0\times10^{-9}$ and $\eta_{\text{CP-ee}}\leq6.9\times10^{-3}$ for superconducting niobium and Cooper pairs, respectively.</description>
