      <description>arXiv:2408.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium arsenide optical resonators have been identified as platforms for light-matter interactions ranging from optomechanics to quantum electrodynamics involving nonlinear optics. Here, we present a 5-mm-diameter whispering gallery mode resonator made of undoped gallium arsenide. The fabrication was done using single-point diamond turning followed by polishing with diamond solutions of varying grain size. The resulting resonator was optically characterized to have a quality factor of more than a million.</description>

      <title>Shannon Entropy Helps Optimize the Performance of a Frequency-Multiplexed Extreme Learning Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the dynamics of neuromorphic photonic schemes would allow their optimization for controlled data-processing capability at possibly minimized energy consumption levels. In nonlinear substrates such as optical fibers or semiconductors, these dynamics can widely vary depending on each optical input encoded with information to process and are in general difficult to estimate. Thus, other approaches are required to optimize the schemes. Using a frequency-multiplexed fiber-based Extreme Learning Machine as an example for a classification task, I use Shannon entropy for optical power and introduce Shannon entropy for optical phase and spectrum, all averaged only over a small subset of the dataset to process. I show that the maximum and upper moderate optical power and phase entropies relate to the best data-processing capability of the Machine and, thus, can be used to find optimal system parameters such as fiber length, input power, and group-velocity dispersion in a more time-efficient manner than running numerical simulations emulating the scheme. Shannon entropy of the spectrum provides the information for what parameter space broadest possible frequency combs can be expected and is interesting from the perspective of frequency comb and supercontinuum generation. The introduced entropies are general and can be easily applied to describe and optimize other neuromorphic-photonic or nonlinear-optics schemes.</description>

      <title>Nanostructuring of AlCu alloy NPs obtained by FLASiS{\dag}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the nanometric scale, alloy nanomaterials behave as new materials since they are able to display structures and properties which are different from those of the pure metal nanostructures or bulk alloys. In this work, the compositional characteristics of AlCu alloy nanoparticles obtained by {\dag}Femtosecond Laser Ablation Synthesis in Solution (FLASiS) on solid targets with different percentages of Al and Cu were studied. Morphology, structure, composition and plasmonic behaviour of the nanoparticles were analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Optical Extinction Spectroscopy (OES). From the obtained results, underlying formation mechanism and a configuration model of a host alumina matrix with copper inclusions is proposed. Analysis of the plasmonic resonance spectral region in the extinction spectra of the synthesized colloids using this model show that the nanoparticles have a Cu filling factors of about 0.02 which agrees with those determined independently from TEM images. The amount of Al and Cu components in the nanoparticle depends on their relative percentages in the initial solid target. Here we describe the possible kinetic formation mechanism of these nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Realization of time-reversal invariant photonic topological Anderson insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder, which is ubiquitous in nature, has been extensively explored in photonics for understanding the fundamental principles of light diffusion and localization, as well as for applications in functional resonators and random lasers. Recently, the investigation of disorder in topological photonics has led to the realization of topological Anderson insulators characterized by an unexpected disorder-induced phase transition. However, the observed photonic topological Anderson insulators so far are limited to the time-reversal symmetry breaking systems. Here, we propose and realize a photonic quantum spin Hall topological Anderson insulator without breaking time-reversal symmetry. The disorder-induced topological phase transition is comprehensively confirmed through the theoretical effective Dirac Hamiltonian, numerical analysis of bulk transmission, and experimental examination of bulk and edge transmissions. We present the convincing evidence for the unidirectional propagation and robust transport of helical edge modes, which are the key features of nontrivial time-reversal invariant topological Anderson insulators. Furthermore, we demonstrate disorder-induced beam steering, highlighting the potential of disorder as a new degree of freedom to manipulate light propagation in magnetic-free systems. Our work not only paves the way for observing unique topological photonic phases but also suggests potential device applications through the utilization of disorder.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Poynting momentum driven particle rotation by cylindrically polarized Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary Poynting momentum (IPM) provides a new degree of freedom for particle manipulation. However, the application of IPM in experiments has been largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the IPM driven particle rotation by cylindrically polarized Gaussian beams with no spin or orbital angular momentum. Theoretical analysis and experimental measurements demonstrate that gold microparticles will be rotated in the azimuthal direction while confined in the radial direction. We achieved controllable rotation of the particle by tuning the cylindrical polarization state. Interestingly, the transfer of IPM to a gold particle is demonstrated to be competitive with that of spin angular momentum. These findings hold promising in light-matter interactions and particle manipulations.</description>

      <title>Deep-sub-cycle attosecond optical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-cycle optical pulse is of great importance for ultrafast science and technology. While a narrower pulse can offer a higher temporal resolution, so far the pulse width has not exceeded the limit of half an optical cycle. Here we propose to break the half-cycle limit via inverse Compton scattering in a nano-slit optical mode, in which a deep-subwavelength-confined optical field can be converted into a deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse by high-energy free electrons flying through. Our calculations show that, with experimentally reachable conditions, a measurable deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse with a width narrower than half an optical cycle can be generated. Quantitatively, using a deep-subwavelength-confined 4.4-$\mu$m-wavelength 100-fs pulsed optical driving field and a 2-MeV 50-as 5-pC electron bunch, we can obtain an attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of 2.55 PHz, a pulse width of 99 as ($\sim$0.25 optical cycle), and a single-pulse photon number larger than 200 around the material damage threshold. Such pulses may open opportunities for studying light-matter interaction on the deep-sub-cycle level, and pave a way to unprecedented optical technology ranging from temporal super-resolution optical microscopy and spectroscopy to unconventional atom/molecule polarization and manipulation.</description>

      <title>$\pi$ mode lasing in the non-Hermitian Floquet topological system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\pi$ modes are unique topological edge states appearing in Floquet systems with periodic modulations of the underlying lattice structure in evolution variable, such as dynamically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. These edge states are anomalous states usually appearing between Floquet replicas of the same band, even if standard topological index remains zero for this band. While linear and nonlinear $\pi$ modes were observed in conservative systems, they have never been studied in nonlinear regime in the non-Hermitian systems with structured gain and losses. Here we show that SSH waveguide array with periodically oscillating waveguide positions in propagation direction and with parity-time symmetric refractive index landscape, can support $\pi$ modes that are damped or amplified at different ends of the array. By including nonlinearity and nonlinear absorption into our continuous system, we achieve stable lasing in $\pi$ mode at one end of the array. The representative feature of this system is that lasing in it is thresholdless and it occurs even at low gain-loss amplitudes. The degree of localization of lasing $\pi$ modes can be flexibly controlled by the amplitude of transverse waveguide oscillations. This work therefore introduces a new type of topological Floquet laser and a route to manipulation of $\pi$ modes by structured gain and losses.</description>

      <title>Realization of Topology-controlled Photonic Cavities in a Valley Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental realization of a new type of topology-controlled photonic cavities in valley photonic crystals by adopting judiciously oriented mirrors to localize the valley-polarized edge states along their propagation path. By using microwave frequency- and time-domain measurements, we directly observe the strong confinement of electromagnetic energy at the mirror surface due to the extended time delay required for the valley index flipping. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that both the degree of energy localization and quality factors of the topology-controlled photonic cavities are determined by the valley-flipping time which is controlled by the topology of the mirror. These results extend and complement the current design paradigm of topological photonic cavities.</description>

      <title>From photon momentum transfer to acceleration sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a typical application of photon momentum transfer, optical levitation systems are known for their ideal isolation from mechanical dissipation and thermal noise. These characters offer extraordinary potential for acceleration precision sensing and have attracted extensive attention in both fundamental and applied physics. Although considerable improvements of optical levitation accelerometers has been reported, the dynamic testing of the sensing performance remains a crucial challenge before the utilization in practical application scenarios. In this work, we present a dual-beam optical levitation accelerometer and demonstrate the test with dynamic inputs for the first time. An acceleration sensing sensitivity of $0.1\mu g$ and a measurement range of $ 1g$ are achieved. These advancements solidify the potential of optical levitation accelerometer for deployment in practical domains, including navigation, intelligent driving, and industrial automation, building a bridge between the laboratory systems and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>In-line fiber optic optofluidic sensor based on a fully open Fabry-Perot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-fiber, fully open Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) cavity that is suitable for fluidic measurement applications. Fabrication of the FPI involves the alignment and bonding of three optical fiber sections using either ceramic glue or low-temperature melting glass. The fabrication procedure allows the protection of the cleaved optical fiber end faces, which serve as the two mirrors of the FPI, from damage, thus ensuring the high visibility of the FPI sensor. The FPI's complete openness permits the analyte of interest fluids to flow smoothly into the cavity and interact directly with the light, obviating the need for additional assistance. The fabrication experiment demonstrates that the fabrication procedure can readily achieve a visibility of over 20 dB. Refractive index testing indicates that the sensor exhibits a sensitivity of over 1116 nm/RIU within the range of 1.334-1.375. A comparison of temperature investigations indicates that the fully open cavity FPI fabricated by bonding with low-temperature melting glass exhibits relatively lower temperature immunity than that bonded with ceramic glue. Both have a relatively low temperature fluctuation within the temperature range of 40{\deg}C-100{\deg}C, with less than 3 nm and 4.5 nm in the over 60{\deg}C changes, respectively. Our proposed fully open FPI is an economical, robust, and simple-to-fabricate structure with the potential for mass production. This renders it an appealing option for practical optofluidics applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of nonreciprocal optical properties of the defect modes in 1D defective photonic crystals with atomic doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of photonic crystals, lacking parity-time (PT) symmetry, using scattering matrix formalism. We show using the symmetry properties of matrices that a defective photonic crystal, doped with three-level atoms, breaks PT symmetry. For the two defect modes lying in the bandgap region, both the reflection and the absorption become nonreciprocal, while the transmission remains reciprocal. We show that the relevant energy spectra do not exhibit exceptional points, thereby invalidating its necessity to achieve nonreciprocity in reflection and absorption. We further demonstrate how this nonreciprocity can be coherently controlled using the driving field and dissipation rates of the atoms.</description>

      <title>Beyond spectral resolution in optical sensing: Picometer-level precision with multispectral readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical sensors offer precision, remote read-out, and immunity to electromagnetic interference but face adoption challenges due to complex and costly readout instrumentation, mostly based on high-resolution. This article challenges the notion that high spectral resolution is necessary for high performance optical sensing. We propose co-optimizing the linewidths of sensor and readout to achieve picometer-level precision using low-resolution multispectral detector arrays and incoherent light sources. This approach is validated in temperature sensing, fiber-tip refractive index sensing, and biosensing, achieving superior precision to high-resolution spectrometers. This paradigm change in readout will enable optical sensing systems with costs and dimensions comparable to electronic sensors.</description>

      <title>Rapid stochastic spatial light modulator calibration and pixel crosstalk optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic light potentials generated by phase-modulating liquid-crystal spatial light modulators (SLMs) are widely used in quantum technology applications. Accurate calibration of the wavefront and intensity profile of the laser beam at the SLM display is key to the high fidelity of holographic potentials. Here, we present a new calibration technique that is faster than previous methods while maintaining the same level of accuracy. By employing stochastic optimisation and random speckle intensity patterns, we calibrate a digital twin that accurately models the experimental setup. This approach allows us to measure the wavefront at the SLM to within $\lambda /170$ in ~ 5 minutes using only 10 SLM phase patterns, a significant speedup over state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, our digital twin models pixel crosstalk on the liquid-crystal SLM, enabling rapid calibration of model parameters and reducing the error in light potentials by a factor of ~ 5 without losing efficiency. Our fast calibration technique will simplify the implementation of high-fidelity light potentials in, for example, quantum-gas microscopes and neutral-atom tweezer arrays where high-NA objectives and thermal lensing can deform the wavefront significantly. Applications in the field of holographic displays that require high image fidelity will benefit from the novel pixel crosstalk calibration, especially for displays with a large field of view and increased SLM diffraction angles.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Corrections to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit is incorrect. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>

      <title>Micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap system with long-term alignment stability for mobile atomic quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies extensively use laser light for state preparation, manipulation, and readout. For field applications, these systems must be robust and compact, driving the need for miniaturized and highly stable optical setups and system integration. In this work, we present a micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap setup, the $\mu$XODT, designed for trapping and cooling $^{87}\text{Rb}$. This fiber-coupled setup operates at $1064\,\text{nm}$ wavelength with up to $2.5\,\text{W}$ optical power and realizes a free-space crossed beam geometry. The $\mu$XODT precisely overlaps two focused beams ($w_0 \approx 33\,\mu\text{m}$) at their waists in a $45^\circ$ crossing angle, achieving a position difference $\leq 3.4\,\mu\text{m}$ and 0.998 power ratio between both beams with long-term stability. We describe the design and assembly process in detail, along with optical and thermal tests with temperatures of up to $65\,^\circ C$. The system's volume of $25\,\text{ml}$ represents a reduction of more than two orders of magnitude compared to typically used macroscopic setups, while demonstrating exceptional mechanical robustness and thermal stability. The $\mu$XODT is integrated with a $^{87}\text{Rb}$ 3D MOT setup, trapping $3 \times 10^5$ atoms from a laser-cooled atomic cloud, and has shown no signs of degradation after two years of operation.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as a promising direction for information propagation with preserved coherence. Due to high tunability of magnons, their interactions with microwave photons can be engineered to probe novel phenomena based on strong photon-magnon coupling. Improving the photon-magnon coupling strength can be done by tuning the structure of microwave resonators to better interact with the magnon counterpart. Planar resonators have been explored due to their potential for on-chip integration, but only common modes from stripline-based resonators have been used. Here, we present a microwave spiral resonator supporting the spoof localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and implement it to the investigation of photon-magnon coupling for hybrid magnonic applications. We showcase strong magnon-LSP photon coupling using a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere. We discuss the dependence of the spiral resonator design to the engineering capacity of the photon mode frequency and spatial field distributions, via both experiment and simulation. By the localized photon mode profiles, the resulting magnetic field concentrates near the surface dielectrics, giving rise to an enhanced magnetic filling factor. The strong coupling and large engineering space render the spoof LSPs an interesting contender in developing novel hybrid magnonic systems and functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigated the performance of split nonlinearity compensation schemes for single and multi-channel WDM systems. We show that split NLC SNR gains of more than 0.4 dB at 5540 km can be achieved compared to transmitter- or receiver-side DBP alone when signal-ASE beating limits transmission performance.</description>

      <title>Squeezed states of light after high-harmonic generation in excited atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently emerged as a promising method for generating non-classical states of light with frequencies spanning from the infrared up to the extreme ultraviolet regime. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of squeezed states of light through HHG processes in atomic systems that had been initially driven to their first excited state. Our study reveals significant single-mode squeezing in both the driving field and low-order harmonic modes. Additionally, we characterize two-mode squeezing features in the generated states, both between fundamental and harmonic modes, and among the harmonic modes themselves. Using these correlations, we demonstrate the generation of optical Schr\"odinger kitten states through heralding measurements, specifically via photon subtraction in one of the modes influenced by two-mode squeezing.</description>

      <title>Chiral topological light for detecting robust enantio-sensitive observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological response of matter to electromagnetic fields is a property in high demand in materials design and metrology due to its robustness against noise and decoherence, stimulating recent advances in ultrafast photonics. Embedding topological properties into the enantio-sensitive optical response of chiral molecules could therefore enhance the efficiency and robustness of chiral optical discrimination. Here we achieve such a topological embedding by introducing the concept of chiral topological light~-- a light beam which displays chirality locally, with an azimuthal distribution of its handedness described globally by a topological charge. The topological charge is mapped onto the azimuthal intensity modulation of the non-linear optical response, where enantio-sensitivity is encoded into its spatial rotation. The spatial rotation is robust against intensity fluctuations and imperfect local polarization states of the driving field. Our theoretical results show that chiral topological light enables detection of percentage-level enantiomeric excesses in randomly oriented mixtures of chiral molecules, opening a way to new, extremely sensitive and robust chiro-optical spectroscopies with attosecond time resolution.</description>

      <title>3D Anderson localization of light in disordered systems of dielectric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of full wave numerical simulations of light transmission by layers of irregular dielectric particles that demonstrate 3D Anderson localization of light in disordered uncorrelated discrete media. Our simulations show that a high degree of disorder in a dense layer prevents transverse spreading of a propagating beam and allows anomalous conservation of its initial polarization state. A transition from the purely diffusive regime to a non-exponential time dependence when approaching the Ioffe-Regel condition is observed in short pulse transmission measurements. Along with this, the transmission spectrum is consistent with the Thouless criterion. The effect depends on the turbidity of the layer: increasing the volume fraction and the refractive index leads to the enhancement of the non-exponential behavior caused by the disorder in the medium which is a clear signature of Anderson localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized states of light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The experimentally realized double helical antennas were studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior resulting in a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Bound States in the Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the concept of time-domain bound states in continuum. We show that a rapid judiciously-designed temporal modulation of the refractive index in a spatially homogenous medium gives rise to a bound state in time embedded in a continuum of wavenumbers. Mathematically, these bound states in the continuum (BIC) are analytic solutions of the Maxwell equations in time and one-dimensional space. Our results show the potential to extend known wave phenomena in space to the temporal domain, providing new avenues for light-matter interactions in time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Complexity of chaotic optical frequency combs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of a single-mode semiconductor laser induced by the optical injection of a frequency comb are analyzed through the lens of complexity. In particular, the focus is dynamics outside the injection-locking region. Permutation entropy (P.E.) and chaos bandwidth (CBW) are used to quantify complexity. Various numerically simulated system outputs across the frequency detuning range and for different injection strengths are considered. Numerically simulated outputs from a single-mode injection system in the absence of comb injection are compared to comment on the origin of the reported complexity. Furthermore, experimental outputs are used to confirm the findings. Despite the presence of periodic dynamics originating from the frequency comb, the presented system generates remarkably high complex outputs with P.E. up to 0.99 maintained over an extended period of observation and long timescales with CBW up to 25 GHz.</description>

      <title>Constructing Berry-Maxwell equations with Lorentz invariance and Gauss' law of Weyl monopoles in 4D energy-momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of a reciprocal electromagnetic field by extending the Berry curvatures into four-dimensional (4D) energy-momentum space. The resulting governing equations, termed Berry-Maxwell equations, are derived, by incorporating Lorentz invariance to constrain the parameter space of energy-momentum. Notably, these Berry-Maxwell equations exhibit dual and self-dual structures compared to the Maxwell equations. The very existence of Berry-Maxwell equations is independent of the geometrical phase of matter waves, implying that they cannot be directly derived from the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Indeed, we find that the physical reality of this reciprocal electromagnetic field is rooted in the fundamental principles of special relativity and Gauss's law of Weyl monopoles. To validate our theory experimentally, we outline three effects for verification: (i) Lorentz boost of a Weyl monopole, (ii) reciprocal Thouless pumping, and (iii) plane-wave solutions of Berry-Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Free electron topological bound state induced by light beam with a twisted wavefront</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in ultrafast electron emission, microscopy, and diffraction have demonstrated a remarkable ability to manipulate free electrons with quantum coherence using light beams. Here, we present a framework for exploring free electron quantum number in ultrafast electron-light interactions. We derive an explicit Jackiw-Rebbi solution for a low-energy free electron wavefunction subjected to a spatiotemporally twisted laser field, resulting in a flying topologically protected bound state with a quantum number of e/2 - termed a "half-electron". This flying bound state is dispersion-free due to its topological nature. We demonstrate the topological confinement and pair generation mechanism of half-electrons in free space, expanding their domain beyond the topological states typically found in solids and photonics. This advancement enhances our understanding of emulating exotic quantum and topological effects with low-energy free electrons.</description>
