      <title>On excitation of control-affine systems and its use for data-driven Koopman approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator and extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) as a data-driven technique for its approximation have attracted considerable attention as a key tool for modeling, analysis, and control of complex dynamical systems. However, extensions towards control-affine systems resulting in bilinear surrogate models are prone to demanding data requirements rendering their applicability intricate. In this paper, we propose a framework for data-fitting of control-affine mappings to increase the robustness margin in the associated system identification problem and, thus, to provide more reliable bilinear EDMD schemes. In particular, guidelines for input selection based on subspace angles are deduced such that a desired threshold with respect to the minimal singular value is ensured. Moreover, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality for maximizing the minimal singular value. Further, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach using bilinear EDMD with control for non-holonomic robots.</description>

      <title>Hybrid ILM-NILM Smart Plug System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical load classification is generally divided into intrusive and non-intrusive approaches, both having their limitations and advantages. With the non-intrusive approach, controlling appliances is not possible, but the installation cost of a single measurement device is cheap. In comparison, intrusive, smart plug-based solutions offer individual appliance control, but the installation cost is much higher. There have been very few approaches aiming to combine these methods. In this paper we show that extending a smart plug-based solution to multiple loads per plug can reduce control granularity in favor of lowering the system's installation costs. Connecting various loads to a Smart Plug through an extension cord is seldom considered in the literature, even though it is common in households. This scenario is also handled by the hybrid load classification solution presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Kalman-Bucy Filtering with Randomized Sensing: Fundamental Limits and Sensor Network Design for Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability analysis of the Kalman filter under randomly lost measurements has been widely studied. We revisit this problem in a general continuous-time framework, where both the measurement matrix and noise covariance evolve as random processes, capturing variability in sensing locations. Within this setting, we derive a closed-form upper bound on the expected estimation covariance for continuous-time Kalman filtering. We then apply this framework to spatiotemporal field estimation, where the field is modeled as a Gaussian process observed by randomly located, noisy sensors. Using clarity, introduced in our earlier work as a rescaled form of the differential entropy of a random variable, we establish a grid-independent lower bound on the spatially averaged expected clarity. This result exposes fundamental performance limits through a composite sensing parameter that jointly captures the effects of the number of sensors, noise level, and measurement frequency. Simulations confirm that the proposed bound is tight for the discrete-time Kalman filter, approaching it as the measurement rate decreases, while avoiding the recursive computations required in the discrete-time formulation. Most importantly, the derived limits provide principled and efficient guidelines for sensor network design problem prior to deployment.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Charging Load Modeling: A Survey, Trends, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of electric vehicles (EVs) is reshaping the automotive industry, advocating for more sustainable transportation practices. Accurately predicting EV charging behavior is essential for effective infrastructure planning and optimization. However, the charging load of EVs is significantly influenced by uncertainties and randomness, posing challenges for accurate estimation. Furthermore, existing literature reviews lack a systematic analysis of modeling approaches focused on information fusion. This paper comprehensively reviews EV charging load models from the past five years. We categorize state-of-the-art modeling methods into statistical, simulated, and data-driven approaches, examining the advantages and drawbacks of each. Additionally, we analyze the three bottom-up level operations of information fusion in existing models. We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities in the field, offering guidance for future research endeavors to advance our understanding and explore practical research directions.</description>

      <title>A Model-Based Approach to Automated Digital Twin Generation in Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern manufacturing demands high flexibility and reconfigurability to adapt to dynamic production needs. Model-based Engineering (MBE) supports rapid production line design, but final reconfiguration requires simulations and validation. Digital Twins (DTs) streamline this process by enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and reconfiguration. This paper presents a novel platform that automates DT generation and deployment using AutomationML-based factory plans. The platform closes the loop with a GAI-powered simulation scenario generator and automatic physical line reconfiguration, enhancing efficiency and adaptability in manufacturing.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network deep learning method for model class selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response-only model class selection capability of a novel deep convolutional neural network method is examined herein in a simple, yet effective, manner. Specifically, the responses from a unique degree of freedom along with their class information train and validate a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. In doing so, the network selects the model class of new and unlabeled signals without the need of the system input information, or full system identification. An optional physics-based algorithm enhancement is also examined using the Kalman filter to fuse the system response signals using the kinematics constraints of the acceleration and displacement data. Importantly, the method is shown to select the model class in slight signal variations attributed to the damping behavior or hysteresis behavior on both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, as well as on a 3D building finite element model, providing a powerful tool for structural health monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Predictive Compensation in Finite-Horizon LQ Games under Gauss-Markov Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a predictive compensation framework for finite-horizon discrete-time linear quadratic dynamic games in the presence of Gauss-Markov deviations from feedback Nash strategies. One player experiences correlated stochastic deviations, modeled via a first-order autoregressive process, while the other compensates using a predictive strategy that anticipates the effect of future correlation. Closed-form recursions for mean and covariance propagation are derived, and the resulting performance improvement is analyzed through the sensitivity of expected cost.</description>

      <title>InvSim algorithm for pre-computing airplane flight controls in limited-range autonomous missions, and demonstration via double-roll maneuver of Mirage III fighters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we start with a generic mathematical framework for the equations of motion (EOM) in flight mechanics with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) for a general (not necessarily symmetric) fixed-wing aircraft. This mathematical framework incorporates (1) body axes (fixed in the airplane at its center of gravity), (2) inertial axes (fixed in the earth/ground at the take-off point), wind axes (aligned with the flight path/course), (3) spherical flight path angles (azimuth angle measured clockwise from the geographic north, and elevation angle measured above the horizon plane), and (4) spherical flight angles (angle of attack and sideslip angle). We then manipulate these equations of motion to derive a customized version suitable for inverse simulation flight mechanics, where a target flight trajectory is specified while a set of corresponding necessary flight controls to achieve that maneuver are predicted. We then present a numerical procedure for integrating the developed inverse simulation (InvSim) system in time; utilizing (1) symbolic mathematics, (2) explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) numerical integration technique, and (3) expressions based on the finite difference method (FDM); such that the four necessary control variables (engine thrust force, ailerons' deflection angle, elevators' deflection angle, and rudder's deflection angle) are computed as discrete values over the entire maneuver time, and these calculated control values enable the airplane to achieve the desired flight trajectory, which is specified by three inertial Cartesian coordinates of the airplane, in addition to the Euler's roll angle. We finally demonstrate the proposed numerical procedure of flight mechanics inverse simulation (InvSim).</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Recurrent Adjacency Memory Network for Mixed-Generation Power System Stability Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85\%, 99.90\%, and 99.69\% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</description>

      <title>Analytical modelling of a stop-less modular bus service with an application to charging strategies comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buses are a vital component of metropolitan public transport, yet conventional bus services often struggle with inefficiencies including extended dwelling time, which increases in-vehicle travel time for non-alighting passengers. A stop-less autonomous modular (SLAM) bus service has emerged as a solution, enabling dynamic capacity to reduce dwelling time. Meanwhile, the electrification of buses is advancing as a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduces operators' costs, but introduces new operational constraints due to charging requirements. This study develops analytical optimization models for SLAM bus service that integrates vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging technology. By comparing the optimal designs and their feasibility across non-charging case and charging strategies, we identify a sequence of operational stages as ridership grows: from idle capacity under low demand, to full small buses, full large buses, and a proposed frequency-capped regime where only bus capacity expands. Under the mobile charging strategy, this progression further includes an energy-limited regime, in which frequency declines, and ultimately infeasibility under high demand. These findings enable operators to deliver more efficient services.</description>

      <title>Removing Time-Scale Separation in Feedback-Based Optimization via Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback-based optimization (FBO) provides a simple control framework for regulating a stable dynamical system to the solution of a constrained optimization problem in the presence of exogenous disturbances, and does so without full knowledge of the plant dynamics. However, closed-loop stability requires the controller to operate on a sufficiently slower timescale than the plant, significantly constraining achievable closed-loop performance. Motivated by this trade-off, we propose an estimator-based modification of FBO which leverages dynamic plant model information to eliminate the time-scale separation requirement of traditional FBO. Under this design, the convergence rate of the closed-loop system is limited only by the dominant eigenvalue of the open-loop system. We extend the approach to the case of design based on only an approximate plant model when the original system is singularly perturbed. The results are illustrated via an application to fast power system frequency control using inverter-based resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-simulation is a critical approach for the design and analysis of complex cyber-physical systems. It will enhance development efficiency and reduce costs. This paper presents a co-simulation framework integrating ROS 2 and MATLAB/Simulink for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control system design and verification. First, a six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor is derived accurately that based on Newton-Euler equations. Second, within the proposed framework, a hierarchical control architecture was designed and implemented: LQR controller for attitude control to achieve optimal regulation performance, and PID controller for position control to ensure robustness and practical applicability. Third, elaborated the architecture of the framework, including the implementation details of the cross-platform data exchange mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, highlighting its capability to provide an efficient and standardized solution for rapid prototyping and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) validation of UAV control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Optimization-Based Concurrent Execution of Learned Robotic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of executing multiple tasks encoded by value functions, each learned through Reinforcement Learning, using an optimization-based framework. Prior works develop such a framework, but left unanswered a fundamental question of when learned value functions can be concurrently executed. The main contribution of this work is to present theorems which provide necessary and sufficient conditions to concurrently execute sets of learned tasks within subsets of the state space, using a previously proposed min-norm controller. These theorems provide insight into when learned control tasks are possible to be made concurrently executable, when they might already inherently be concurrently executable and when it is not possible at all to make a set of learned tasks concurrently executable using the previously proposed methods. Additional contributions of this work include extending the optimization-based framework to execute multiple tasks encoded by value functions to also account for value functions trained with a discount factor, making the overall framework more compatible with standard RL practices.</description>

      <title>Differential Flatness of Quasi-Static Slider-Pusher Models with Applications in Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic properties of planar slider-pusher systems as a motion primitive in manipulation tasks. To that end, we construct a differential kinematic model deriving from the limit surface approach under the quasi-static assumption and with negligible contact friction. The quasi-static model applies to generic slider shapes and circular pusher geometries, enabling a differential kinematic representation of the system. From this model, we analyze differential flatness - a property advantageous for control synthesis and planning - and find that slider-pusher systems with polygon sliders and circular pushers exhibit flatness with the centre of mass as a flat output. Leveraging this property, we propose two control strategies for trajectory tracking: a cascaded quasi-static feedback strategy and a dynamic feedback linearization approach. We validate these strategies through closed-loop simulations incorporating perturbed models and input noise, as well as experimental results using a physical setup with a finger-like pusher and vision-based state detection. The real-world experiments confirm the applicability of the simulation gains, highlighting the potential of the proposed methods for</description>

      <title>ComEMS4Build: Comfort-Oriented Energy Management System for Residential Buildings using Hydrogen for Seasonal Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating flexible loads and storage systems into the residential sector contributes to the alignment of volatile renewable generation with demand. Besides batteries serving as a short-term storage solution, residential buildings can benefit from a Hydrogen (H2) storage system, allowing seasonal shifting of renewable energy. However, as the initial costs of H2 systems are high, coupling a Fuel Cell (FC) with a Heat Pump (HP) can contribute to the size reduction of the H2 system. The present study develops a Comfort-Oriented Energy Management System for Residential Buildings (ComEMS4Build) comprising Photovoltaics (PV), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and H2 storage, where FC and HP are envisioned as complementary technologies. The fuzzy-logic-based ComEMS4Build is designed and evaluated over a period of 12 weeks in winter for a family household building in Germany using a semi-synthetic modeling approach. The Rule-Based Control (RBC), which serves as a lower benchmark, is a scheduler designed to require minimal inputs for operation. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) is intended as a cost-optimal benchmark with an ideal forecast. The results show that ComEMS4Build, similar to MPC, does not violate the thermal comfort of occupants in 10 out of 12 weeks, while RBC has a slightly higher median discomfort of 0.68 Kh. The ComEMS4Build increases the weekly electricity costs by 12.06 EUR compared to MPC, while RBC increases the weekly costs by 30.14 EUR. The ComEMS4Build improves the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) utilization and energy exchange with the main grid compared to the RBC. However, when it comes to the FC operation, the RBC has an advantage, as it reduces the toggling counts by 3.48% and working hours by 7.59% compared to MPC...</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Photosynthesis Regulation Under Oscillating Light Condition - Part I: In-Silico Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of data-driven system identification techniques in the frequency domain to obtain simplified, control-oriented models of photosynthesis regulation under oscillating light conditions. In-silico datasets are generated using simulations of the physics-based Basic DREAM Model (BDM) Funete et al.[2024], with light intensity signals -- comprising DC (static) and AC (modulated) components as input and chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) as output. Using these data, the Best Linear Approximation (BLA) method is employed to estimate second-order linear time-invariant (LTI) transfer function models across different operating conditions defined by DC levels and modulation frequencies of light intensity. Building on these local models, a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) representation is constructed, in which the scheduling parameter is defined by the DC values of the light intensity, providing a compact state-space representation of the system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Overview and Performance Evaluation of Supervisory Controller Synthesis with Eclipse ESCET v4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervisory controllers control cyber-physical systems to ensure their correct and safe operation. Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what' the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it (design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process, particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024) that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize complex models.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman Economic Model Predictive Control of a Pasteurisation Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for efficient operation of a laboratory-scale pasteurization unit (PU). The method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear system dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of convex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep Koopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from experimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy over conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were employed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs, such as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization, and actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables. The deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear model of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include feed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be pastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a 32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This improvement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy consumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC requires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical advantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic optimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.</description>

      <title>Deep Dictionary-Free Method for Identifying Linear Model of Nonlinear System with Input Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays pose significant challenges for prediction, estimation, and control due to their inherent complexity and the impact of delays on system behavior. Traditional linear control techniques often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.</description>

      <title>Data-driven uncertainty-aware seakeeping prediction of the Delft 372 catamaran using ensemble Hankel dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Phase-Shifted Carrier Optimization for Cascaded Bridge Converters, Modular Multilevel Converters, and Reconfigurable Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-shifted carrier pulse-width modulation (PSC-PWM) is a widely adopted scheduling algorithm in cascaded bridge converters, modular multilevel converters, and reconfigurable batteries. However, non-uniformed pulse widths for the modules with fixed phase shift angles lead to significant ripple current and output-voltage distortion. Voltage uniformity instead would require optimization of the phase shifts of the individual carriers. However, the computational burden for such optimization is beyond the capabilities of any simple embedded controller. This paper proposes a neural network that emulates the behavior of an instantaneous optimizer with significantly reduced computational burden. The proposed method has the advantages of stable performance in predicting the optimum phase-shift angles under balanced battery modules with non-identical modulation indices without requiring extensive lookup tables, slow numerical optimization, or complex controller tuning. With only one (re)training session for any specified number of modules, the proposed method is readily adaptable to different system sizes. Furthermore, the proposed framework also includes a simple scaling strategy that allows a neural network trained for fewer modules to be reused for larger systems by grouping modules and adjusting their phase shifts. The scaling strategy eliminates the need for retraining. Large-scale assessment, simulations, and experiments demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce the current ripple and the weighted total harmonic distortion by up to 50 % in real time and is 100 to 500 thousand times faster than a conventional optimizer (e.g., genetic algorithms), making it the only solution for an online application.</description>

Abstract: Landmark Inertial Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (LI-SLAM) is the problem of estimating the locations of landmarks in the environment and the robot's pose relative to those landmarks using landmark position measurements and measurements from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This paper proposes a nonlinear observer for LI-SLAM posed in continuous time and analyses the observer in a base space that encodes all the observable states of LI-SLAM. The local exponential stability and almost-global asymptotic stability of the error dynamics in base space is established in the proof section and validated using simulations.</description>

      <title>Funnel-Based Online Recovery Control for Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on recovery control of nonlinear systems from attacks or failures. The main challenges of this problem lie in (1) learning the unknown dynamics caused by attacks or failures with formal guarantees, and (2) finding the invariant set of states to formally ensure the state deviations allowed from the nominal trajectory. To solve this problem, we propose to apply the Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) to learn the unknown dynamics using the data from the real-time system states. The input-output property of this REN model is guaranteed by incremental integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). Then, we propose a funnel-based control method to achieve system recovery from the deviated states. In particular, a sufficient condition for nominal trajectory stabilization is derived together with the invariant funnels along the nominal trajectory. Eventually, the effectiveness of our proposed control method is illustrated by a simulation example of a DC microgrid control application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid power plants (HPPs) combine multiple power generators (conventional/variable) and energy storage capabilities to support generation inadequacy and grid demands. This paper introduces a modeling and control design framework for hybrid power plants (HPPs) consisting of a wind farm, solar plant, and battery storage. Specifically, this work adapts established modeling paradigms for wind farms, solar plants and battery models into a control affine form suitable for control design at the supervisory level. In the case of wind and battery models, generator torque and cell current control laws are developed using nonlinear control and control barrier function techniques to track a command from a supervisory control law while maintaining safe and stable operation. The utility of this modeling and control framework is illustrated through a test case using a utility demand signal for tracking, time varying wind and irradiance data, and a rule-based supervisory control law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent cost and schedule deviations remain a major challenge in the U.S. construction industry, revealing the limitations of deterministic CPM and static document-based estimating. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision (CV)-driven progress measurement, Bayesian probabilistic CPM updating, and deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable cost-schedule alignment through a 5D knowledge graph. Findings confirm that integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL enhances forecasting precision, transparency, and control resilience. The validated workflow establishes a practical pathway toward predictive, adaptive, and auditable construction management.</description>

      <title>Friction on Demand: A Generative Framework for the Inverse Design of Metainterfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations, which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.</description>

      <title>Assessing Climate Vulnerability Risk for Substations in Massachusetts Via Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric grid is increasingly vital, supporting essential services such as healthcare, heating and cooling transportation, telecommunications, and water systems. This growing dependence on reliable power underscores the need for enhanced grid resilience. This study presents Eversource's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) for bulk distribution substations in Massachusetts, evaluating risks from storm surge, sea level rise, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The focus is on developing a cost-efficient model to guide targeted resilience investments. This is achieved by overcoming the limitations of single-variable analyses through hazard-specific assessments that integrate spatial, climate, electrical asset, and other relevant data; and applying sensitivity analysis to establish data-driven thresholds for actionable climate risks. By integrating geospatial analysis and data modeling with power engineering principles, this study provides a practical and replicable framework for equitable, data-informed climate adaptation planning. The results indicate that thresholds for certain climate hazards can be highly sensitive and result in significantly larger sets of stations requiring mitigation measures to adequately adapt to climate change, indicating that high-fidelity long-term climate projections are critical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities, represent significant threats to public health, safety, and the environment. This paper introduces a systematic approach for modeling and assessing covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that leverage system identification techniques to inform the attack design. We focus on the attacker's ability to deploy a covert controller, and we evaluate countermeasures based on the Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD) anomaly detection method. Using a second-order linear time-invariant with time delay model, representative of water treatment dynamics, we design and simulate stealthy attacks. Our results highlight how factors such as system noise and inaccuracies in the attacker's plant model influence the attack's stealthiness, underscoring the need for more robust detection strategies in industrial control environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of ensembles of dynamical systems is an intriguing and challenging problem, arising for example in quantum control. We initiate the investigation of optimal control of ensembles of discrete-time systems, focusing on minimising the average finite horizon cost over the ensemble. For very general nonlinear control systems and stage and terminal costs, we establish existence of minimisers under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we provide a $\Gamma$-convergence result which enables consistent approximation of the challenging ensemble optimal control problem, for example, by using empirical probability measures over the ensemble. Our results form a solid foundation for discrete-time optimal control of ensembles, with many interesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>Approximate non-linear model predictive control with safety-augmented neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) achieves stability and constraint satisfaction for general nonlinear systems, but requires computationally expensive online optimization. This paper studies approximations of such MPC controllers via neural networks (NNs) to achieve fast online evaluation. We propose safety augmentation that yields deterministic guarantees for convergence and constraint satisfaction despite approximation inaccuracies. We approximate the entire input sequence of the MPC with NNs, which allows us to verify online if it is a feasible solution to the MPC problem. We replace the NN solution by a safe candidate based on standard MPC techniques whenever it is infeasible or has worse cost. Our method requires a single evaluation of the NN and forward integration of the input sequence online, which is fast to compute on resource-constrained systems. The proposed control framework is illustrated using two numerical non-linear MPC benchmarks of different complexity, demonstrating computational speedups that are orders of magnitude higher than online optimization. In the examples, we achieve deterministic safety through the safety-augmented NNs, where a naive NN implementation fails.</description>

      <title>Robust Nonlinear Data-Driven Predictive Control for Mixed Vehicle Platoons via Koopman Operator and Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed vehicle platoons, comprising connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), hold significant potential for enhancing traffic performance. However, most existing control strategies assume linear system dynamics and often ignore the impact of adverse factors such as noise, disturbances, and attacks, which are inherent to real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Robust Nonlinear Data-Driven Predictive Control (RNDDPC) framework that ensures safe and optimal control under uncertain and adverse conditions. By utilizing Koopman operator theory, we map the system's nonlinear dynamics into a higher-dimensional space, constructing a Koopman-based model that approximates the behavior of the original nonlinear system. To mitigate modeling errors associated with this predictor, we introduce a data-driven reachable set analysis technique that performs secondary learning using matrix zonotope sets, generating a reachable set predictor for over-approximation of the future states of the underlying system. Then, we formulate the RNDDPC optimization problem and solve it in a receding horizon manner for robust control inputs. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in tracking performance under noise, disturbances, and attacks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimators for Robust Backup Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing safe controllers is crucial and notoriously challenging for input-constrained safety-critical control systems. Backup control barrier functions offer an approach for the construction of safe controllers online by considering the flow of the system under a backup controller. However, in the presence of model uncertainties, the flow cannot be accurately computed, making this method insufficient for safety assurance. To tackle this shortcoming, we integrate backup control barrier functions with uncertainty estimators and calculate the flow under a reconstruction of the model uncertainty while refining this estimate over time. We prove that the controllers resulting from the proposed Uncertainty Estimator Backup Control Barrier Function (UE-bCBF) approach guarantee safety, are robust to unknown disturbances, and satisfy input constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, low-order models of the frequency and voltage response of mixed-generation, low-inertia systems are presented. These models are unique in their ability to efficiently and accurately model frequency and voltage dynamics without increasing the computational burden as the share of inverters is increased in a system. The models are validated against industry-grade electromagnetic transient simulation, compared to which the proposed models are several orders of magnitude faster. The accuracy and efficiency of the low-inertia frequency and voltage models makes them well suited for a variety of planning and operational studies, especially for multi-scenario and probabilistic studies, as well as for screening studies to establish impact zones based on the dynamic interactions between inverters and synchronous generators.</description>

      <title>KAN-Therm: A Lightweight Battery Thermal Model Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery management systems (BMSs) rely on real-time estimation of battery temperature distribution in battery cells to ensure safe and optimal operation of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, physical BMS often suffers from memory and computational resource limitations required by highfidelity models. Temperature prediction using physics-based models becomes challenging due to their higher computational time. In contrast, machine learning based approaches offer faster predictions but demand larger memory overhead. In this work, we develop a lightweight and efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) based thermal model, KAN-Therm, to predict the core temperature of a cylindrical battery. We have compared the memory overhead and computation costs of our method with Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long shortterm memory (LSTM) network. Our results show that the proposed KAN-Therm model exhibit the best prediction accuracy with the least memory overhead and computation time.</description>

      <title>MAPS: A Mode-Aware Probabilistic Scheduling Framework for LPV-Based Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes Mode-Aware Probabilistic Scheduling (MAPS), a novel adaptive control framework tailored for DC motor systems experiencing varying friction. MAPS uniquely integrates an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimator with a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) based control strategy, leveraging real-time mode probability estimates to perform probabilistic gain scheduling. A key innovation of MAPS lies in directly using the updated mode probabilities as the interpolation weights for online gain synthesis in the LPV controller, thereby tightly coupling state estimation with adaptive control. This seamless integration enables the controller to dynamically adapt control gains in real time, effectively responding to changes in frictional operating modes without requiring explicit friction model identification. Validation on a Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) environment demonstrates that MAPS significantly enhances both state estimation accuracy and reference tracking performance compared to Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers relying on predefined scheduling variables. These results establish MAPS as a robust, generalizable solution for friction-aware adaptive control in uncertain, time-varying environments, with practical real-time applicability.</description>

      <title>On Structural Properties of Risk-Averse Optimal Stopping Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish structural properties of optimal stopping problems under time-consistent dynamic (coherent) risk measures, focusing on value function monotonicity and the existence of control limit (threshold) optimal policies. While such results are well developed for risk-neutral (expected-value) models, they remain underexplored in risk-averse settings. Coherent risk measures typically lack the tower property and are subadditive rather than additive, complicating structural analysis. We show that value function monotonicity mirrors the risk-neutral case. Moreover, if the risk envelope associated with each coherent risk measure admits a minimal element, the risk-averse optimal stopping problem reduces to an equivalent risk-neutral formulation. We also develop a general procedure for identifying control limit optimal policies and use it to derive practical, verifiable conditions on the risk measures and MDP structure that guarantee their existence. We illustrate the theory and verify these conditions through optimal stopping problems arising in operations, marketing, and finance.</description>

      <title>TIMESAFE: Timing Interruption Monitoring and Security Assessment for Fronthaul Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular systems embrace the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, exemplified by the evolution of the fronthaul (FH) connection between cellular baseband and radio unit equipment. Crucially, synchronization over the FH is pivotal for reliable 5G services. In recent years, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet network topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, TSN standards, such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP), focus on performance with little to no concern for security. This increases the exposure of the open FH to security risks. Attacks targeting synchronization mechanisms pose significant threats, potentially disrupting 5G networks and impairing connectivity.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of successful spoofing and replay attacks against PTP synchronization. We show how a spoofing attack is able to cause a production-ready O-RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular base station to catastrophically fail within 2 seconds of the attack, necessitating manual intervention to restore full network operations. To counter this, we design a Machine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various malicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Mini Wheelbot: A Testbed for Learning-based Balancing, Flips, and Articulated Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mini Wheelbot is a balancing, reaction wheel unicycle robot designed as a testbed for learning-based control. It is an unstable system with highly nonlinear yaw dynamics, non-holonomic driving, and discrete contact switches in a small, powerful, and rugged form factor. The Mini Wheelbot can use its wheels to stand up from any initial orientation - enabling automatic environment resets in repetitive experiments and even challenging half flips. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Mini Wheelbot as a testbed by implementing two popular learning-based control algorithms. First, we showcase Bayesian optimization for tuning the balancing controller. Second, we use imitation learning from an expert nonlinear MPC that uses gyroscopic effects to reorient the robot and can track higher-level velocity and orientation commands. The latter allows the robot to drive around based on user commands - for the first time in this class of robots. The Mini Wheelbot is not only compelling for testing learning-based control algorithms, but it is also just fun to work with, as demonstrated in the video of our experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of continuous-time piecewise linear systems based on piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov functions typically requires continuity of these functions over a partition of the state space. Several conditions for guaranteeing continuity of PWQ functions over state space partitions can be found in the literature. In this technical note, we show that these continuity conditions are equivalent over so-called simplicial conic partitions. As a consequence, the choice of which condition to impose can be based solely on practical considerations such as specific application or numerical aspects, without introducing additional conservatism in the analysis.</description>

Abstract: We study the robustness of an agent decision-making model in finite-population games, with a particular focus on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model. Specifically, we examine how the model's parameters influence the impact of various sources of noise and modeling inaccuracies -- factors commonly encountered in engineering applications of population games -- on agents' decision-making. Our analysis provides insights into how these parameters can be effectively tuned to mitigate such effects. Theoretical results are supported by numerical examples and simulation studies that validate the analysis and illustrate practical strategies for parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Oja's Component Flow for General Square Matrices and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the global convergence properties of the Oja flow, a continuous-time algorithm for principal component extraction, was established for general square matrices. The Oja flow is a matrix differential equation on the Stiefel manifold designed to extract a dominant subspace. Although its analysis has traditionally been restricted to symmetric positive-definite matrices, where it acts as a gradient flow, recent applications have extended its use to general matrices. In this non-symmetric case, the flow extracts the invariant subspace corresponding to the eigenvalues with the largest real parts. However, prior convergence results have been purely local, leaving the global behavior as an open problem. The findings of this study fill this gap by providing a comprehensive global convergence analysis, establishing that the flow converges exponentially for almost all initial conditions. We also propose a modification to the algorithm that enhances its numerical stability. As an application of this theory, we developed novel methods for model reduction of linear dynamical systems and the synthesis of low-rank stabilizing controllers. The study advances the theoretical understanding of the Oja flow and demonstrates its potential as a reliable and versatile tool for analyzing and controlling complex linear systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization via a Control-Centric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05455v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical technologies, where speed and reliability of convergence directly impact performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard: controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control. In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and gradient dynamics. Each realization shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics, and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.</description>

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>When Semantics Connect the Swarm: LLM-Driven Fuzzy Control for Cooperative Multi-Robot Underwater Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to partial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and the lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free conditions.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function for Aligning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source language models, aiming to generate positive text.</description>
