      <title>Scalable platform enabling reservoir computing with nanoporous oxide memristors for image recognition and time series prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical mammal brains have some form of random connectivity between neurons. Reservoir computing, a neural network approach, uses random weights within its processing layer along with built-in recurrent connections and short-term, fading memory, and is shown to be time and training efficient in processing spatiotemporal signals. Here we prepared a niobium oxide-based thin film memristor device with intrinsic structural in-homogeneity in the form of random nanopores and performed computational tasks of XOR operations, image recognition, and time series prediction and reconstruction. For the latter task we chose a complex three-dimensional chaotic Lorenz-63 time series. By applying three temporal voltage waveforms individually across the device and training the readout layer with electrical current signals from a three-output physical reservoir, we achieved satisfactory prediction and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to the case of no reservoir. This work highlights the potential for scalable, on-chip devices using all-oxide reservoir systems, paving the way for energy-efficient neuromorphic electronics dealing with time signals.</description>

      <title>Effect of Local Topological Changes on Resistance in Tunably-Disordered Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered materials occur naturally and also provide a broader design space than ordered or crystalline structures. We investigate a two-dimensional disordered network metamaterial constructed from a Delaunay triangulation of an underlying point cloud. Small perturbations in the point cloud induce discrete topological changes. One such change we identify is a Delaunay flip, in which two neighboring Delaunay triangles that form a convex quadrilateral structure with their common edge being one of the two quadrilateral diagonals exchange this diagonal for the other diagonal. These topological changes can cause substantial jumps in the effective resistance measured diagonally across the network, when the change is located near the source or the sink node. The jumps are explained analytically by showing that the change in effective resistance from edge removal or addition depends on the voltage drop across that edge. However, Delaunay flips have less impact on global resistance measurements and in larger networks. These local topological changes are relevant for finite-sized samples and experimentally-measurable properties such as electrical transport. Global characterizations of the network disorder or topology lack the location-specificity of our observed effects on network transport, and thus may be inadequate for predicting certain experimentally measurable transport properties in disordered network metamaterials, highlighting the importance of localized regions in material design.</description>

      <title>Theory of Optimal Learning Rate Schedules and Scaling Laws for a Random Feature Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Setting the learning rate for a deep learning model is a critical part of successful training, yet choosing this hyperparameter is often done empirically with trial and error. In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $\eta_T^\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $\eta_T^\star(t) \simeq T^{-\xi} (1-t/T)^{\delta}$ where $\xi$ and $\delta$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $\beta(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $\eta_T(t) \sim T^{-\xi}$ (2) optimal power laws $\eta_T(t) \sim T^{-\xi} t^{-\chi}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these. Our theory suggests that learning rate transfer across training horizon depends on the structure of the model and task. We explore these ideas in simple experimental pretraining setups.</description>

      <title>A brief review of evolutionary game dynamics in the reinforcement learning paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation, fairness, trust, and resource coordination are cornerstones of modern civilization, yet their emergence remains inadequately explained by the persistent discrepancies between theoretical predictions and behavioral experiments. Part of this gap may arise from the imitation learning paradigm commonly used in prior theoretical models, which assumes individuals merely copy successful neighbors according to predetermined, fixed rules. This review examines recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics that employ reinforcement learning (RL) as an alternative paradigm. In RL, individuals learn through trial and error and introspectively refine their strategies based on environmental feedback. We begin by introducing key concepts in evolutionary game theory and the two learning paradigms, then synthesize progress in applying RL to elucidate cooperation, trust, fairness, optimal resource coordination, and ecological dynamics. Collectively, these studies indicate that RL offers a promising unified framework for understanding the diverse social and ecological phenomena observed in human and natural systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of the Sub-Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics is a powerful framework for analyzing optimization yielding analytical results for matching, optimal transport, and other combinatorial problems. However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Theory of Speciation Transitions in Diffusion Models with General Class Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Emergent Coherence at the Edge of Magnetism: Low-Doped La2-xSrxCuO4+delta Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The La2-xSrxCuO4+delta (LSCO) system provides a unique experimental setting for exploring how magnetism, superconductivity, and disorder jointly shape charge transport in a doped Mott insulator. Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.</description>

      <title>Disordered harmonic chain with random masses and springs: a combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study harmonic chains with i.i.d. random spring constants $K_n$ and i.i.d. random masses $m_n$. We introduce a new combinatorial approach which allows to derive a compact approximate expression for the complex Lyapunov exponent, in terms of the solutions of two transcendental equations involving the distributions of the spring constants and the masses. Our result makes easy the asymptotic analysis of the low frequency properties of the eigenmodes (spectral density and localization) for arbitrary disorder distribution, as well as their high frequency properties. We apply the method to the case of power-law distributions $p(K)=\mu\,K^{-1+\mu}$ with $0&lt;K&lt;1$ and $q(m)=\nu\,m^{-1-\nu}$ with $m&gt;1$ (with $\mu,\:\nu&gt;0$). At low frequency, the spectral density presents the power law $\varrho(\omega\to0)\sim\omega^{2\eta-1}$, where the exponent $\eta$ exhibits first order phase transitions on the line $\mu=1$ and on the line $\nu=1$. The exponent of the non disordered chain ($\eta=1/2$) is recovered when $\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n\rangle$ are both finite, i.e. $\mu&gt;1$ and $\nu&gt;1$. The Lyapunov exponent (inverse localization length) shows also a power-law behaviour $\gamma(\omega^2\to0)\sim\omega^{2\zeta}$, where the exponent $\zeta$ exhibits several phase transitions~: the exponent is $\zeta=\eta$ for $\mu&lt;1$ or $\nu&lt;1$ ($\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ or $\langle m_n\rangle$ infinite) and $\zeta=1$ when $\mu&gt;2$ and $\nu&gt;2$ ($\langle K_n^{-2}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n^2\rangle$ both finite). In the intermediate region it is given by $\zeta=\mathrm{min}(\mu,\nu)/2$. On the transition lines, $\varrho(\omega)$ and $\gamma(\omega^2)$ receive logarithmic corrections. Finally, we also consider the Anderson model with random couplings (random spring chain for ``Dyson type I'' disorder).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions have recently emerged as a promising framework for describing new dynamical phenomena in heterogeneous contagion processes. However, a fundamental open question is how to understand their contribution from the perspective of the physics of critical phenomena. Based on a mesoscopic field-theoretic Langevin description, we show that: (i) pairwise mechanisms such as facilitation or thresholding are formally equivalent to higher-order ones, (ii) pairwise interactions at coarse-grained scales govern the higher-order contact process and, (iii) the interplay between noise and topology is determined by the network spectral dimension. In short, we demonstrate that classical field theories, rooted on model symmetries and/or network dimensionality, still capture the nature of the phase transition, also predicting finite-size effects in real and synthetic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality. Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective, demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition. This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a geometric breakdown hitherto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal dimensions and unveils hidden LRG flows toward unstable structural fixed points. Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-induced superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of states with long-range correlations in a disordered landscape is rare, as disorder typically suppresses the particle mobility required for long-range coherence. But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>
