      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in linear magnetoelectric material Mn$_{3}$Ta$_{2}$O$_{8}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single crystal samples of a linear magnetoelectric material Mn$_{3}$Ta$_{2}$O$_{8}$, which exhibits a collinear antiferromagnetic order, to reveal the spin dynamics. Numerous modes observed in the neutron spectra were reasonably reproduced by linear spin-wave theory on the basis of the spin Hamiltonian including eight Heisenberg interactions and an easy-plane type single-ion anisotropy. The presence of strong frustration was found in the identified spin Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Anomalous electronic energy relaxation and soft phonons in the Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used a combination of linear response time-domain THz spectroscopy (TDTS) and high-field non-linear THz spectroscopy to separately probe the electronic momentum and energy relaxation rates respectively of the Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$. We find, consistent with prior measurements, that Cd$_3$As$_2$ has an enormous nonlinearities in the THz frequency range. We extract the momentum relaxation rate of Cd$_3$As$_2$ using Drude fits to the optical conductivity. We also conduct THz range 2D coherent spectroscopy. The dominant response is a pump-probe signal, which allow us to separately extract the energy relaxation rate. We find that the rate of energy relaxation decreases down to the lowest measured temperatures. We connect this to Cd$_3$As$_2$ anomalous lattice dynamics, evidence for which is found in its low thermal conductivity and soft phonons in Raman scattering. The lack of a peak in the energy relaxation rate as a function of T can be connected to the linear in T dependence of the current relaxation e.g. the phonon scattering is elastic down to the lowest measured temperatures approximately 120 K.</description>

      <title>Using magnetic dynamics to measure the spin gap in a candidate Kitaev material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials potentially hosting Kitaev spin-liquid states are considered crucial for realizing topological quantum computing. However, the intricate nature of spin interactions within these materials complicates the precise measurement of low-energy spin excitations indicative of fractionalized excitations. Using Na$_{2}$Co$_2$TeO$_{6}$ as an example, we study these low-energy spin excitations using the time-resolved resonant elastic x-ray scattering (tr-REXS). Our observations unveil remarkably slow spin dynamics at the magnetic peak, whose recovery timescale is several nanoseconds. This timescale aligns with the extrapolated spin gap of $\sim$ 1 $\mu$eV, obtained by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in the thermodynamic limit. The consistency demonstrates the efficacy of tr-REXS in discerning low-energy spin gaps inaccessible to conventional spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Strong Symmetry Breaking in Open Systems: Purification Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the landscape of the decoherence effect in mixed-state ensembles from a purification perspective. We analyze the spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) in mixed states triggered by local quantum channels by mapping this decoherence process to unitary operations in the purified state within an extended Hilbert space. Our key finding is that mixed-state long-range order and SSSB can be mapped into symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in the purified state. Notably, the measurement-induced long-range order in the purified SPT state mirrors the long-range order in the mixed state due to SSSB, characterized by the Renyi-2 correlator. We establish a correspondence between fidelity correlators in the mixed state, which serve as a measure of SSSB, and strange correlators in the purification, which signify the SPT order. This purification perspective is further extended to explore intrinsic mixed-state topological order and decoherent symmetry-protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose measurement-producing hierarchy emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <title>Compactification of Determinant Expansions via Transcorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI (FCI) method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. Additionally, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology protected by latent crystalline symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher- order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile optical control of interlayer stacking order in 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonvolatile optical manipulation of material properties on demand is a highly sought-after feature in the advancement of future optoelectronic applications. While the discovery of such metastable transition in various materials holds good promise for achieving this goal, their practical implementation is still in the nascent stage. Here, we unravel the nature of the ultrafast laser-induced hidden state in 1T-TaS2 by systematically characterizing the electronic structure evolution throughout the reversible transition cycle. We identify it as a mixed-stacking state involving two similarly low-energy interlayer orders, which is manifested as the charge density wave phase disruption. Furthermore, our comparative experiments utilizing the single-pulse writing, pulse-train erasing and pulse-pair control explicitly reveal the distinct mechanism of the bidirectional transformations -- the ultrafast formation of the hidden state is initiated by a coherent phonon which triggers a competition of interlayer stacking orders, while its recovery to the initial state is governed by the progressive domain coarsening. Our work highlights the deterministic role of the competing interlayer orders in the nonvolatile phase transition in the layered material 1T-TaS2, and promises the coherent control of the phase transition and switching speed. More importantly, these results establish all-optical engineering of stacking orders in low-dimensional materials as a viable strategy for achieving desirable nonvolatile electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Raman signatures of the strong intra- and inter-molecular charge oscillations in bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene (BEDT-TTF) \k{appa}-phase salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First principle calculations of the Raman intensities of a (BEDT-TTF)^+_2 centrosymmetric dimer lead to a full reconsideration of the assignment of the three C=C stretching phonons in \k{appa}-phase BEDT-TTF salts. In contrast with previous interpretation, it is found that the presence of the out-of-phase coupling of the antisymmetric external C=C stretching mode has also to be taken into account. This mode, infrared-active for a single BEDT-TTF molecule, implies a strong intra-molecular charge oscillation along BEDT-TTF long molecular axis. In the consequent reassignment of the C=C spectral region, a very broad band appearing in the cross polarized Raman spectra is interpreted as due to inter -dimer electron-molecular vibration (e-mv) coupling, to be contrasted with the well known intra-dimer e-mv coupling that induces very strong infrared absorptions. Analysis of the data in term of a properly developed e-mv scheme yields an evaluation of the Hubbard parameters relevant to the so-called effective dimer model often used to interpret the physical properties of \k{appa}-BEDT-TTF salts. Finally the Raman spectra of an asymmetric (BEDT-TTF)^{+0.6} (BEDT-TTF)^{+0.4} dimer have been calculated in order to interpret the Raman spectra of the intriguing charge-ordered (CO), ferroelectric phase of \k{appa}-(BEDT-TTF)_2 Hg(SCN)_2 Cl. It turns out that in the asymmetric dimer the strong intra-dimer the e-mv induced infrared C=C stretching absorption should appear with huge intensity also in Raman. The absence of such band in the spectra of \k{appa}-(BEDT-TTF)_2 Hg(SCN)_2 Cl ferroelectric phase gives clear alternative indications about the possible CO pattern in such a phase.</description>

      <title>Calculated Unconventional Superconductivity via Charge Fluctuations in Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons on Kagome lattice exhibit a wealth of features including Dirac points, van Hove singularities and flatbands. When the Fermi level is placed at the van Hove saddle point, the Fermi surface is perfectly nested and a rich variety of electronic instabilities is known to occur. The material realization of such scenario is a recently discovered Kagome system CsV3Sb5 whose superconductivity near charge-density wave instability at low temperatures points to an unconventional, non-electron-phonon, pairing mechanism. Here we use a recently developed combination of density functional theory with momentum and frequency-resolved self-energies deduced from the so-called fluctuational-exchange-type random phase approximation to study charge fluctuation mediated pairing tendencies in CsV3Sb5. Based on our numerical diagonalization of the BCS gap equation, two competing solutions emerge from these calculations with A_{1g} (anisotropic s-wave-like) and B_{2g} (d_{x2-y2},d_{xy}-like) symmetries of the superconducting order parameter. Our evaluated Eliashberg spectral functions {\alpha}2F({\omega}) are purely due to electronic correlations; they were found to be strongly peaked in the vicinity of frequency 7 meV that sets the scale of charge fluctuations. The superconducting coupling constants for the leading pairing channels are estimated as a function of the nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction V, a well-known prime parameter of the extended Hubbard model. They were found in the range of 0.2-0.4 depending on V. We evaluate the superconducting T_{c} close to the values that are observed experimentally that point to the charge fluctuations to provide a substantial contribution to the pairing mechanism in CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction gauge and low-dimensionalization in four dimensional QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube formation in four-dimensional (4D) QCD, we investigate a possibility of low-dimensionalization in 4D QCD. We propose a new gauge fixing of ``dimensional reduction (DR) gauge" defined so as to minimize $R_{\mathrm{DR}}~\equiv~\int d^{4}s ~ \mathrm{Tr} \left[ A_{x}^{2}(s) + A_{y}^{2}(s) \right]$, which has a residual gauge symmetry for the gauge function $\Omega (t,z)$ like 2D QCD on the $t$-$z$ plane. We investigate low-dimensionalization in the DR gauge in SU(3) lattice QCD at $\beta = 6.0$. The amplitude of $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed in the DR gauge. We consider ``$tz$-projection'' of $A_{x,y}(s) \to 0$ for the gauge configuration generated in the DR gauge, in a similar sense to Abelian projection in the maximally Abelian gauge. By the $tz$-projection in the DR gauge, the interquark potential is not changed, and $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ play a dominant role in quark confinement. In the DR gauge, we calculate a spatial correlation $\langle \mathrm{Tr} A_{\perp}(s) A_{\perp}(s+ra_{\perp}) \rangle ~ (\perp = x,y)$ and estimate the spatial mass of $A_{\perp}(s) ~ (\perp = x,y)$ as $M \simeq 1.7 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. It is conjectured that this large mass makes $A_{\perp}(s)$ inactive and realizes the dominance of $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ in infrared region in the DR gauge. We also calculate the spatial correlation of two temporal link-variables and find that the correlation decreases as $\exp (-mr)$ with $m \simeq 0.6 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. Using a crude approximation, 4D QCD is reduced into an ensemble of 2D QCD systems with the coupling of $g_{\rm 2D} = g m$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the spatially inhomogeneous condensates in the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model via the bosonic two-point function in the infinite-$N$ limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the known phase boundary between the phase with chiral symmetry and the phase of spatially inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in the phase diagram of the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model can be detected from the bosonic two-point function alone and thereby confirms and extends previous results arXiv:hep-th/0008175, arXiv:0807.2571, arXiv:0909.3714, arXiv:1810.03921, arXiv:2203.08503. The analysis is refered to as the stability analysis of the symmetric phase and does not require knowledge about spatial modulations of condensates. We perform this analysis in the infinite-$N$ limit at nonzero temperature and nonzero quark and chiral chemical potentials also inside the inhomogeneous phase. Thereby we observe an interesting relation between the bosonic $1$-particle irreducible two-point vertex function of the chiral Gross-Neveu model and the spinodal line of the Gross-Neveu model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, recently spotlighted in condensed matter physics, presents captivating physical properties and holds promise for spintronics applications. This study delves into the theoretical description and categorization of two-dimensional altermagnetism using spin group theory. Employing spin-group formalism, we establish seven distinct spin layer groups, extending beyond the conventional five spin Laue groups, to describe two-dimensional altermagnetism. Utilizing these findings, we classify previously reported two-dimensional altermagnets and identify novel materials exhibiting altermagnetism. Specifically, monolayer MnTeMoO$_6$ and VP$_2$H$_8$(NO$_4$)$_2$ are predicted to be two-dimensional altermagnets. Furthermore, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristics through symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations, substantiating their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States</title>

Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: strong symmetry, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and weak symmetry, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function $\mathrm{Tr}(O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho)$, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity $F(\rho, O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho O_yO^{\dagger}_x)$, dubbed the fidelity correlator. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher R\'enyi indices.</description>

      <title>Principal deuterium Hugoniot via Quantum Monte Carlo and $\Delta$-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the principal deuterium Hugoniot for pressures up to $150$ GPa, using Machine Learning potentials (MLPs) trained with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) energies, forces and pressures. In particular, we adopted a recently proposed workflow based on the combination of Gaussian kernel regression and $\Delta$-learning. By fully taking advantage of this method, we explicitly considered finite-temperature electrons in the dynamics, whose effects are highly relevant for temperatures above $10$ kK. The Hugoniot curve obtained by our MLPs shows a good agreement with the most recent experiments, particularly in the region below 60 GPa. At larger pressures, our Hugoniot curve is slightly more compressible than the one yielded by experiments, whose uncertainties generally increase, however, with pressure. Our work demonstrates that QMC can be successfully combined with $\Delta$-learning to deploy reliable MLPs for complex extended systems across different thermodynamic conditions, by keeping the QMC precision at the computational cost of a mean-field calculation.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Visualization of a Cascade of Magnetic Orders in the Layered Antiferromagnet $GdTe_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $GdTe_{3}$ is a layered antiferromagnet which has attracted attention due to its exceptionally high mobility, distinctive unidirectional incommensurate charge density wave (CDW), superconductivity under pressure, and a cascade of magnetic transitions between 7 and 12 K, with as yet unknown order parameters. Here, we use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy to directly image the charge and magnetic orders in $GdTe_{3}$. Below 7 K, we find a striped antiferromagnetic phase with twice the periodicity of the Gd lattice and perpendicular to the CDW. As we heat the sample, we discover a spin density wave with the same periodicity as the CDW between 7 and 12 K; the viability of this phase is supported by our Landau free energy model. Our work reveals the order parameters of the magnetic phases in $GdTe_{3}$ and shows how the interplay between charge and spin can generate a cascade of magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>Solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points: Loop soups of 1+1D conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points by attaching 1+1D conformal field theories (CFTs) to fluctuating domain walls forming a ``loop soup''. Specifically, our local Hamiltonian attaches gapless spin chains to the domain walls of a triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet. The macroscopic degeneracy between antiferromagnetic configurations is split by the Casimir energy of each decorating CFT, which is usually negative and thus favors a short loop phase with a finite gap. However, we found a set of 1D CFT Hamiltonians for which the Casimir energy is effectively positive, making it favorable for domain walls to coalesce into a single ``snake'' which is macroscopically long and thus hosts a CFT with a vanishing gap. The snake configurations are geometrical objects also known as fully-packed self-avoiding walks or Hamiltonian walks which are described by an $\mathrm{O}(n=0)$ loop ensemble with a non-unitary 2+0D CFT description. Combining this description with the 1+1D decoration CFT, we obtain a 2+1D theory with unusual critical exponents and entanglement properties. Regarding the latter, we show that the $\log$ contributions from the decoration CFTs conspire with the spatial distribution of loops crossing the entanglement cut to generate a ``non-local area law''. Our predictions are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuation of multipoint correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conceptually, the Matsubara formalism (MF), using imaginary frequencies, and the Keldysh formalism (KF), formulated in real frequencies, give equivalent results for systems in thermal equilibrium. The MF has less complexity and is thus more convenient than the KF. However, computing dynamical observables in the MF requires the analytic continuation from imaginary to real frequencies. The analytic continuation is well-known for two-point correlation functions (having one frequency argument), but, for multipoint correlators, a straightforward recipe for deducing all Keldysh components from the MF correlator had not been formulated yet. Recently, a representation of MF and KF correlators in terms of formalism-independent partial spectral functions and formalism-specific kernels was introduced by Kugler, Lee, and von Delft [Phys. Rev. X 11, 041006 (2021)]. We use this representation to formally elucidate the connection between both formalisms. We show how a multipoint MF correlator can be analytically continued to recover all partial spectral functions and yield all Keldysh components of its KF counterpart. The procedure is illustrated for various correlators of the Hubbard atom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials have recently drawn great attention due to the interplay between nontrivial band topology, electron correlations, and Van Hove singularities related many-body orders. Here we report three new vanadium-based kagome metals, TiV6Sn6, ZrV6Sn6, and HfV6Sn6, and conduct a comprehensive investigation of their structural, magnetic, and electrical transport properties. All three compounds exhibit large unsaturated magnetoresistances and multiband Hall effects at low temperatures, indicating the existence of multiple highly mobile carriers. Both the diagonal and off-diagonal resistivity show quantum oscillations with nontrivial Berry phases and high quantum mobilities. First-principles calculations together with quantum oscillation analyses suggest the Van Hove singularities at the M point for the three compounds all located in close vicinity of the Fermi level, and there also exist multiple topological nontrivial band crossings, including a nodal ring and a massive Dirac cone. Our work extends the kagome AM6X6 family and paves the way for searching possible Van Hove physics in the V kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Transport Property of Spin-1/2 Random Heisenberg Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quenched disorders can strongly influence the physical properties of quantum many-body systems. The real-space strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) analysis has shown that the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain is controlled by the infinite-randomness fixed point (IRFP) and forms a random singlet (RS) ground state. Motivated by recent thermal transport experiments on the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet copper benzoate [B. Y. Pan et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 167201 (2022)], we adapt the SDRG to study the low-temperature properties of the random Heisenberg chain by assuming that its low-energy excited states are captured by the parent Hamiltonian of the RS ground state as well. We find that while the specific heat coefficient and the uniform magnetic susceptibility scale as $C/T\sim T^{-\alpha_{c}}$ and $\chi\sim T^{-\alpha_{s}}$ with $0&lt;\alpha_{c,s}&lt;1$, indicating a divergent low-energy density of states, the thermal and the spin conductivities scale as $\kappa/T\sim T$ and $\sigma_{s}\sim T$, which implies a vanishing density of extended states in the low-energy limit. We believe that such a disparity in the thermodynamic and transport properties is a common feature of random systems controlled by the IRFP.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional correlated electronic multi-orbital systems with either ladder or chain geometries continue attracting considerable interest due to their complex electronic phases arising from the interplay of the hopping matrix, the crystal-fields splitting, the electronic correlations, and strong quantum fluctuations. Recently, the intriguing cobalt zigzag chain system BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$, with electronic density $n = 7$, was prepared experimentally. Here, we systematically study the electronic and magnetic properties of this quasi-one-dimensional compound from the theory perspective. Based on first-principles density functional theory calculations, strongly anisotropic one-dimensional electronic Co $3d$ bands were found near the Fermi level. By evaluating the relevant hopping amplitudes, we provide the magnitude and origin of the nearest-neighbor (NN) and next nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping matrices in BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$. With this information, we constructed a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this zigzag chain system, and studied two cases: with only a NN hopping matrix, and with NN plus NNN hopping matrices. Introducing the Hubbard and Hund couplings and studying the model via the density matrix renormalization group method, we constructed the ground-state phase diagram. A robust staggered antiferromagnetic (AFM) region was found when only the NN hopping matrix in the chain direction was employed. However, for the realistic case where the NNN hopping matrix is also included, the dominant state becomes instead a block AFM order, in agreement with experiments. The system displays Mott insulator characteristics with three half-filled orbitals, when the block AFM order is stable. Our results for BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$ provide guidance to experimentalists and theorists working on this zigzag one-dimensional chain and related materials.</description>

Abstract: We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by ongoing work on pump-probe experiments and Floquet driven magnets, we theoretically study the impact of pumped and driven Einstein phonons with weak dissipation in multipolar Mott insulators. For Mott insulators with pseudospin-$1/2$ non-Kramers doublets hosting octupolar and quadrupolar moments, we show that pumping the ${\cal E}_g$ phonon modes which couple linearly to the quadrupoles leads to characteristic chiral phonon dynamics below the octupolar ordering transition. We also explore steady states in the presence of continuously driven phonons, showing that a coherent two-phonon drive with a suitable phase choice can be used to 'train' octupolar order or even switch its sign. For spin-$1$ magnets, which host dipolar and quadrupolar moments, we show that one-phonon and two-phonon drives can generate Floquet flavor-wave excitations and induce dipolar magnetization. Our results are obtained using a generalized $SU(N)$ Monte Carlo for the multipolar degrees of freedom with numerical integration of the coupled spin-phonon equations of motion. Our work opens up pathways to explore phonon-driven dynamics in multipolar magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments reporting unconventional collective modes in the charge density-wave (CDW) state of rare-earth tritellurides $R$Te$_3$, we derive from a multi-orbital microscopic model on the square net a CDW Ginzburg-Landau theory that allows for non-trivial orbital order. Our analysis reveals unconventional CDWs where order parameters with distinct orbital character coexist due to an approximate symmetry of the low-energy model, which becomes exact in the limit of nearest-neighbor-only hopping and decoupled $p_x$, $p_y$ orbitals. Because of this coexistence, the resulting CDW pattern displays an orbital texture that generally breaks additional symmetries of the lattice besides those explicitly broken by the CDW wave-vector. In particular, we find two competing phases that differ in whether they break or preserve inversion and vertical mirror symmetries. We explain the mechanisms that favor each outcome, and discuss experimental probes that can distinguish the different phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport properties of gapless edge modes at boundaries between topologically distinct domains are of fundamental and technological importance. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of topological edge states and their response to interparticle interactions. Here, we experimentally study long-distance quantised Hall drifts in a harmonically confined topological pump of non-interacting and interacting ultracold fermionic atoms. We find that quantised drifts halt and reverse their direction when the atoms reach a critical slope of the confining potential, revealing the presence of a topological boundary. The drift reversal corresponds to a band transfer between a band with Chern number $C = +1$ and a band with $C = -1$ via a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for non-interacting particles. We establish that a non-zero repulsive Hubbard interaction leads to the emergence of an additional edge in the system, relying on a purely interaction-induced mechanism, in which pairs of fermions are split.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological superconductivity in the Rashba-Hubbard model, describing heavy-atom superlattice and van der Waals materials with broken inversion. We focus in particular on fillings close to the van Hove singularities, where a large density of states enhances the superconducting transition temperature. To determine the topology of the superconducting gaps and to analyze the stability of their surface states in the presence of disorder and residual interactions, we employ an fRG+MFT approach, which combines the unbiased functional renormalization group (fRG) with a real-space mean-field theory (MFT). Our approach uncovers a cascade of topological superconducting states, including $A_1$ and $B_1$ pairings, whose wave functions are of dominant $p$- and $d$-wave character, respectively, as well as a time-reversal breaking $A_1 + i B_1$ pairing. While the $A_1$ and $B_1$ states have first order topology with helical and flat-band Majorana edge states, respectively, the $A_1 + i B_1$ pairing exhibits second-order topology with Majorana corner modes. We investigate the disorder stability of the bulk superconducting states, analyze interaction-induced instabilites of the edge states, and discuss implications for experimental systems.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the profound impact of correlation effects and crystal imperfections is essential for an accurate description of solids. Here we study the role of correlation, disorder, and multi-magnon processes in THz magnons. Our findings reveal that a significant part of the electron self-energy, which goes beyond the adiabatic local spin density approximation, arises from the interaction between electrons and a virtual magnon gas. This interaction leads to a substantial modification of the exchange splitting and a renormalization of magnon energies, in agreement with the experimental data. We establish a quantitative hierarchy of magnon relaxation processes based on first principles.</description>

Abstract: A key issue in both the field of quantum chaos and quantum gravity is an effective description of chaotic conformal field theories (CFTs), that is CFTs that have a quantum ergodic limit. We develop a framework incorporating the constraints of conformal symmetry and locality, allowing the definition of ensembles of `CFT data'. These ensembles take on the same role as the ensembles of random Hamiltonians in more conventional quantum ergodic phases of many-body quantum systems. To describe individual members of the ensembles, we introduce the notion of approximate CFT, defined as a collection of `CFT data' satisfying the usual CFT constraints approximately, i.e. up to small deviations. We show that they generically exist by providing concrete examples. Ensembles of approximate CFTs are very natural in holography, as every member of the ensemble is indistinguishable from a true CFT for low-energy probes that only have access to information from semi-classical gravity. To specify these ensembles, we impose successively higher moments of the CFT constraints. Lastly, we propose a theory of pure gravity in AdS$_3$ as a random matrix/tensor model implementing approximate CFT constraints. This tensor model is the maximum ignorance ensemble compatible with conformal symmetry, crossing invariance, and a primary gap to the black-hole threshold. The resulting theory is a random matrix/tensor model governed by the Virasoro 6j-symbol.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced many-body separability transitions</title>

Abstract: We study quantum many-body mixed states with a symmetry from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) symmetric pure states. We provide evidence for 'symmetry-enforced separability transitions' in a variety of states, where in one regime the mixed state is expressible as a convex sum of symmetric SRE pure states, while in the other regime, such a representation is not feasible. We first discuss Gibbs state of Hamiltonians that exhibit spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry, and argue that the associated thermal phase transition can be thought of as a symmetry-enforced separability transition. Next, we study cluster states in various dimensions subjected to local decoherence, and identify several distinct mixed-state phases and associated separability phase transitions, which also provides an alternate perspective on recently discussed 'average SPT order'. We also study decohered p+ip superconductors, and find that if the decoherence breaks the fermion parity explicitly, then the resulting mixed state can be expressed as a convex sum of non-chiral states, while a fermion-parity preserving decoherence results in a phase transition at a non-zero threshold that corresponds to spontaneous breaking of fermion parity. Finally, we briefly discuss systems that satisfy NLTS (no low-energy trivial state) property, such as the recently discovered good LDPC codes, and argue that the Gibbs state of such systems exhibits a temperature-tuned separability transition.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity induced by a Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effective low-energy fermionic theory of the Kondo-Kitaev model to leading order in the Kondo coupling. Our main goal is to understand the nature of the superconducting instability induced in the proximate metal due to its coupling to spin fluctuations of the spin liquid. The special combination of the low-energy modes of a graphene-like metal and the form of the interaction induced by the Majorana excitations of the spin liquid furnish chiral superconducting order with $p_x + \mathrm{i} p_y$ symmetry. Computing its response to a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field moreover shows that this superconducting state is topologically non-trivial, characterized by a first Chern number of $\pm 2$.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual effective field theory for an SYK model</title>

Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description for an SYK model, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extradimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections given by the Schwarzian action when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extradimension, we observe that the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients RG-flow along the extradimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. To confirm this insulating physics, we investigate thermodynamics. We obtain an effective free energy functional in terms of such bi-local dual order-parameter fields, which satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the holographic dual effective field theory. ...</description>
