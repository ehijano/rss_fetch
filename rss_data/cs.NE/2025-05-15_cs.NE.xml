      <title>A Standardized Benchmark Set of Clustering Problem Instances for Comparing Black-Box Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One key challenge in optimization is the selection of a suitable set of benchmark problems. A common goal is to find functions which are representative of a class of real-world optimization problems in order to ensure findings on the benchmarks will translate to relevant problem domains. While some problem characteristics are well-covered by popular benchmarking suites, others are often overlooked. One example of such a problem characteristic is permutation invariance, where the search space consists of a set of symmetrical search regions. This type of problem occurs e.g. when a set of solutions has to be found, but the ordering within this set does not matter. The data clustering problem, often seen in machine learning contexts, is a clear example of such an optimization landscape, and has thus been proposed as a base from which optimization benchmarks can be created. In addition to the symmetry aspect, these clustering problems also contain potential regions of neutrality, which can provide an additional challenge to optimization algorithms. In this paper, we present a standardized benchmark suite for the evaluation of continuous black-box optimization algorithms, based on data clustering problems. To gain insight into the diversity of the benchmark set, both internally and in comparison to existing suites, we perform a benchmarking study of a set of modular CMA-ES configurations, as well as an analysis using exploratory landscape analysis. Our benchmark set is open-source and integrated with the IOHprofiler benchmarking framework to encourage its use in future research.</description>

      <title>Equilibrio de carga para transformadores de distribuci\'on el\'ectrica mejorando la calidad de servicio en fin de l\'inea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of electrical energy faces global challenges, such as increasing demand, the integration of distributed generation, high energy losses, and the need to improve service quality. In particular, load imbalance-where loads are not evenly distributed across the circuit phase-can reduce efficiency, shorten equipment lifespan, and increase susceptibility to service interruptions. While methods that involve shifting loads from one phase to another can be costly, they are effective when smart meters are available and implemented efficiently. This work proposes the use of genetic algorithms to optimally identify which loads should be reassigned in order to improve both phase balance and voltage quality at the end nodes of the network while minimizing the number of required changes. The algorithm was evaluated through simulations using PandaPower, a power flow analysis tool, modeling simple networks based on real-world characteristics of the electrical system in Tucum\'an.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Recommender Models and the Illusion of Progress: A Concerning Study of Reproducibility and a Conceptual Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Countless new machine learning models are published every year and are reported to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in \emph{top-n} recommendation. However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</description>

      <title>A Bio-Inspired Research Paradigm of Collision Perception Neurons Enabling Neuro-Robotic Integration: The LGMD Case</title>

Abstract: Compared to human vision, locust visual systems excel at rapid and precise collision detection, despite relying on only hundreds of thousands of neurons organized through a few neuropils. This efficiency makes them an attractive model system for developing artificial collision-detecting systems. Specifically, researchers have identified collision-selective neurons in the locust's optic lobe, called lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs), which respond specifically to approaching objects. Research upon LGMD neurons began in the early 1970s. Initially, due to their large size, these neurons were identified as motion detectors, but their role as looming detectors was recognized over time. Since then, progress in neuroscience, computational modeling of LGMD's visual neural circuits, and LGMD-based robotics have advanced in tandem, each field supporting and driving the others. Today, with a deeper understanding of LGMD neurons, LGMD-based models have significantly improved collision-free navigation in mobile robots including ground and aerial robots. This review highlights recent developments in LGMD research from the perspectives of neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. It emphasizes a biologically plausible research paradigm, where insights from neuroscience inform real-world applications, which would in turn validate and advance neuroscience. With strong support from extensive research and growing application demand, this paradigm has reached a mature stage and demonstrates versatility across different areas of neuroscience research, thereby enhancing our understanding of the interconnections between neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. Furthermore, this paradigm would shed light upon the modeling and robotic research into other motion-sensitive neurons or neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an $L_2$ loss on the reconstruction error, and an $L_0$ (or, equivalently, an $L_1$) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we solve the sparse representation QUBOs by solving them both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor using a stochastic Non-equilibrium Boltzmann Machine (NEBM). Second, we deploy Quantum Evolution Monte Carlo with Reverse Annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2 to evolve the solution quality from the respective machines. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. We demonstrate that both quantum annealing and neuromorphic computing are suitable for binary sparse coding QUBOs, and that Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.</description>
