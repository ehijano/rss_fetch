      <title>Genetic diversity of barley accessions and their response under abiotic stresses using different approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this investigation, five separate experiments were carried out. The first experiments were examined the molecular characteristics of 59 barley accessions collected from different regions in Iraq using three different molecular markers (ISSR, CDDP, and Scot). A total of 391 amplified polymorphic bands were generated using forty-four ISSR, nine CDDP, and twelve Scot primers, which they totally observed 255, 35, and 101 polymorphic bands respectively. The mean values of PIC for ISSR, CDDP, and Scot markers were 0.74, 0.63, and 0.80, respectively, indicating the efficiency of the underlying markers in detecting polymorphic status among the studied barley accessions. Based on the respective markers, the barley accessions were classified and clustered into two main groups using the UPGMA and population structure analysis. Results of claustral analyses showed that the variation patterns corresponded with the geographical distribution of barley accessions.</description>

      <title>Integrative Pan-Cancer Analysis of RNMT: a Potential Prognostic and Immunological Biomarker</title>

Abstract: Background: RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT) is one of the main regulators of N7-methylguanosine, and the deregulation of RNMT correlated with tumor development and immune metabolism. However, the specific function of RNMT in pan-cancer remains unclear.
  Methods: RNMT expression in different cancers was analyzed using multiple databases, including Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to estimate the correlation of RNMT expression to prognosis. The data was also used to research the relationship between RNMT expression and common immunoregulators, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR), and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Additionally, the cBioPortal website was used to evaluate the characteristics of RNMT alteration. The TISDB database was used to obtain the expression of different subtypes. The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database was used to analyze the association between RNMT and tumor immune infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify the relevant pathways.
  Results: RNMT was ubiquitously highly expressed across cancers and survival analysis revealed that its expression was highly associated with the clinical prognosis of various cancer types. Remarkably, RNMT participates in immune regulation and plays a crucial part in the tumor microenvironment. A positive association was found between RNMT expression and six immune cell types expression in colon adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, RNMT expression was highly associated with immunoregulators in most cancer types, and correlated to TMB, MSI, MMR, and DNMT. Finally, GSEA indicated that RNMT may correlate with tumor immunity.</description>
