      <title>Model Predictive Control of the Neural Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.</description>

      <title>Community Detection from Multiple Observations: from Product Graph Model to Brain Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multilayer graph model for the community detection from multiple observations. This is a very frequent situation, when different estimators are applied to infer graph edges from signals at its nodes, or when different signal measurements are carried out. The multilayer network stacks the graph observations at the different layers, and it links replica nodes at adjacent layers. This configuration matches the Cartesian product between the ground truth graph and a path graph, where the number of nodes corresponds to the number of the observations. Stemming on the algebraic structure of the Laplacian of the Cartesian multilayer network, we infer a subset of the eigenvectors of the true graph and perform community detection. Experimental results on synthetic graphs prove the accuracy of the method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of ability of correctly detecting graph communities. Finally, we show the application of our method to discriminate different brain networks derived from real EEG data collected during motor imagery experiments. We conclude that our approach appears promising in identifying graph communities when multiple observations of the graph are available and it results promising for EEG-based motor imagery applications.</description>

      <title>Introducing the modularity graph: an application to brain functional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In signal processing, exploring complex systems through network representations has become an area of growing interest. This study introduces the modularity graph, a new graph-based feature, to highlight the relationship across the graph communities. After showing an application to the random graph class known as Stochastic Block Model, we consider the brain functional connectivity network estimated from real EEG data. The modularity graph provides a quantitative framework for examining the interactions between neuron clusters within the brain's network. The modularity graph works alongside multiscale community detection algorithms, thereby enabling the identification of community structures at various scales. After introducing the modularity graph, we apply it to the brain functional connectivity network, estimated from publicly available EEG recordings of motor imagery experiments. Statistical analysis across multiple scales shows that the modularity graph differs for the distinct brain connectivity states associated with various motor imagery tasks. This work emphasizes the application of signal on graph processing techniques to understand brain behavior during specific cognitive tasks, leveraging the novel modularity graph to identify patterns of brain connectivity in different cognitive conditions. This approach sets the stage for further signal on graph analysis to devise brain network modularity, and to gain insights into the motor imagery mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Eight challenges in developing theory of intelligence</title>

Abstract: A good theory of mathematical beauty is more practical than any current observation, as new predictions of physical reality can be verified self-consistently. This belief applies to the current status of understanding deep neural networks including large language models and even the biological intelligence. Toy models provide a metaphor of physical reality, allowing mathematically formulating that reality (i.e., the so-called theory), which can be updated as more conjectures are justified or refuted. One does not need to pack all details into a model, but rather, more abstract models are constructed, as complex systems like brains or deep networks have many sloppy dimensions but much less stiff dimensions that strongly impact macroscopic observables. This kind of bottom-up mechanistic modeling is still promising in the modern era of understanding the natural or artificial intelligence. Here, we shed light on eight challenges in developing theory of intelligence following this theoretical paradigm. Theses challenges are representation learning, generalization, adversarial robustness, continual learning, causal learning, internal model of the brain, next-token prediction, and finally the mechanics of subjective experience.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Bayesian inference emerge from energy efficient synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological synaptic transmission is unreliable, and this unreliability likely degrades neural circuit performance. While there are biophysical mechanisms that can increase reliability, for instance by increasing vesicle release probability, these mechanisms cost energy. We examined four such mechanisms along with the associated scaling of the energetic costs. We then embedded these energetic costs for reliability in artificial neural networks (ANN) with trainable stochastic synapses, and trained these networks on standard image classification tasks. The resulting networks revealed a tradeoff between circuit performance and the energetic cost of synaptic reliability. Additionally, the optimised networks exhibited two testable predictions consistent with pre-existing experimental data. Specifically, synapses with lower variability tended to have 1) higher input firing rates and 2) lower learning rates. Surprisingly, these predictions also arise when synapse statistics are inferred through Bayesian inference. Indeed, we were able to find a formal, theoretical link between the performance-reliability cost tradeoff and Bayesian inference. This connection suggests two incompatible possibilities: evolution may have chanced upon a scheme for implementing Bayesian inference by optimising energy efficiency, or alternatively, energy efficient synapses may display signatures of Bayesian inference without actually using Bayes to reason about uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Large language models surpass human experts in predicting neuroscience results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. To evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs were confident in their predictions, they were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where humans and LLMs team together to make discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience-specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavors.</description>

      <title>Lattice physics approaches for neural networks</title>

Abstract: Modern neuroscience has evolved into a frontier field that draws on numerous disciplines, resulting in the flourishing of novel conceptual frames primarily inspired by physics and complex systems science. Contributing in this direction, we recently introduced a mathematical framework to describe the spatiotemporal interactions of systems of neurons using lattice field theory, the reference paradigm for theoretical particle physics. In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures. This synopsis yields the key concepts needed to describe neural networks using lattice physics. Such classes of methods are attention-worthy in an era of blistering improvements in numerical computations, as they can facilitate relating the observation of neural activity to generative models underpinned by physical principles.</description>

      <title>Geometric Neural Network based on Phase Space for BCI-EEG decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on brain signal analysis is still in its nascent stages compared to their success in fields like Computer Vision, especially in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where the brain activity is decoded to control external devices without requiring muscle control. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely adopted choice for designing BCI systems due to its non-invasive and cost-effective nature and excellent temporal resolution. Still, it comes at the expense of limited training data, poor signal-to-noise, and a large variability across and within-subject recordings. Finally, setting up a BCI system with many electrodes takes a long time, hindering the widespread adoption of reliable DL architectures in BCIs outside research laboratories. To improve adoption, we need to improve user comfort using, for instance, reliable algorithms that operate with few electrodes. Approach: Our research aims to develop a DL algorithm that delivers effective results with a limited number of electrodes. Taking advantage of the Augmented Covariance Method with SPDNet, we propose the SPDNet$_{\psi}$ architecture and analyze its performance and computational impact, as well as the interpretability of the results. The evaluation is conducted on 5-fold cross-validation, using only three electrodes positioned above the Motor Cortex. The methodology was tested on nearly 100 subjects from several open-source datasets using the Mother Of All BCI Benchmark (MOABB) framework. Main results: The results of our SPDNet$_{\psi}$ demonstrate that the augmented approach combined with the SPDNet significantly outperforms all the current state-of-the-art DL architecture in MI decoding. Significance: This new architecture is explainable, with a low number of trainable parameters and a reduced carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Prescribed exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network with delayed feedback: Insights in seizure prevention and neural control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides control-oriented delay-based modelling of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield-type subject to an external input designed as delayed feedback. The specificity of such a model is that it makes the considered neuron less susceptible to seizure caused by its inherent dynamic instability. This modelling exploits a recently set partial pole placement for linear functional differential equations, which relies on the coexistence of real spectral values, allowing the explicit prescription of the closed-loop solution's exponential decay. The proposed framework improves some pioneering and scarce results from the literature on the characterization of the exact solution's exponential decay when a simple real spectral value exists. Indeed, it improves neural stability when the inherent dynamic is stable and provides insights into the design of a one-layer neural network that can be stabilized exponentially with delayed feedback and with a prescribed decay rate regardless of whether the inherent neuron dynamic is stable or unstable.</description>
