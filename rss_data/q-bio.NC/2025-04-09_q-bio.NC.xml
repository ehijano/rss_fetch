      <title>The many roads to dementia: a systems view of Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is not the outcome of a single cause but the convergence of many. This review reframes dementia as a systemic failure, where amyloid plaques and tau tangles are not root causes but late-stage byproducts of the underlying metabolic collapse. We begin by tracing the historical merger of early- and late-onset Alzheimer's into a single disease category, a conceptual error that may have misdirected decades of research. We then synthesize evidence pointing to metabolic dysfunction - especially mitochondrial damage - as a more likely initiating event. Through this lens, we examine diverse contributing factors including type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, infections and neuroinflammation. Finally, we assess current treatment limitations and argue that prevention, grounded in early metabolic and vascular interventions, holds the most promise for altering the course of this complex disease.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Geometry for the classification of brain states with intracortical brain-computer interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Riemannian geometry-based methods for brain decoding using invasive electrophysiological recordings. Although previously employed in non-invasive, the utility of Riemannian geometry for invasive datasets, which are typically smaller and scarcer, remains less explored. Here, we propose a Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) classifier using a Riemannian geometry approach based on covariance matrices extracted from intracortical Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings across various regions during different brain state dynamics. For benchmarking, we evaluated the performance of our approach against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Euclidean MDM classifiers. Our results indicate that the Riemannian geometry-based classification not only achieves a superior mean F1 macro-averaged score across different channel configurations but also requires up to two orders of magnitude less computational training time. Additionally, the geometric framework reveals distinct spatial contributions of brain regions across varying brain states, suggesting a state-dependent organization that traditional time series-based methods often fail to capture. Our findings align with previous studies supporting the efficacy of geometry-based methods and extending their application to invasive brain recordings, highlighting their potential for broader clinical use, such as brain computer interface applications.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Inter-brain Synchronization in Remote Communication: Investigating the Role of Transmission Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-brain synchronization (IBS), the alignment of neural activities between individuals, is a fundamental mechanism underlying effective social interactions and communication. Prior research has demonstrated that IBS can occur during collaborative tasks and is deeply connected to communication effectiveness. Building on these findings, recent investigations reveal that IBS happens during remote interactions, implying that brain activities between individuals can synchronize despite latency and physical separation. However, the conditions under which this synchronization occurs or is disrupted in remote settings, especially the effect of latency, are not fully understood. This study investigates how varying transmission latency affects IBS, in order to identify thresholds where synchronization is disrupted. Using electroencephalography measurements quantified through Phase Locking Value -- a metric that captures synchronization between brainwave phases -- we first confirm synchronization under face-to-face conditions and then observe changes in IBS across remote communication scenarios. Our findings reveal that IBS can occur during remote collaboration, but is critically dependent on transmission delays, with delays exceeding 450 ms significantly disrupting synchronization. These findings suggest that IBS may serve as a key indicator of communication quality in remote interactions, offering insights for improving remote communication systems and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Resting State Functional Connectivity Patterns Associate with Alcohol Use Disorder Characteristics: Insights from the Triple Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prolonged alcohol use results in neuroadaptations that mark more severe and treatment-resistant alcohol use. The goal of this study was to identify functional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed heavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN) networks would reflect self reported recent and lifetime alcohol use, laboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics related to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model (TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized partial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC) patterns and their association with AUD characteristics. We observed three concurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross communication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history density of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii) alcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings demonstrate the utility of combining theory- and data-driven approaches to uncover associations between resting-state functional substrates and AUD-related characteristics that could aid in the identification, development, and testing of novel treatment targets across preclinical and clinical models.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The Mutual information has been broadly applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data, and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information in arbitrary orders in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single binss. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</description>

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major complications in diabetic patients' eyes, potentially leading to permanent blindness if not detected timely. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing DR. The method employed is the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm, applied to identify DR and its severity stages from fundus images using the public dataset "APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection." Literature was reviewed via ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore. Classification results using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) showed the best performance for the binary classes normal (0) and DR (1) with an accuracy of 99.55%, precision of 99.54%, recall of 99.54%, and F1-score of 99.54%. For the multiclass classification No_DR (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), Proliferate_DR (4), the accuracy was 95.26%, precision 95.26%, recall 95.17%, and F1-score 95.23%. Evaluation using the confusion matrix yielded results of 99.68% for binary classification and 96.65% for multiclass. This study highlights the significant potential in enhancing the accuracy of DR diagnosis compared to traditional human analysis</description>

      <title>Retinotopic Mechanics derived using classical physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a cell$'$s receptive field is a bedrock in systems neuroscience, and the classical static description of the receptive field has had enormous success in explaining the fundamental mechanisms underlying visual processing. Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to probe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the introduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics. At its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive fields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent. Specifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that supports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically inspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\propto \sim 1 /\Delta M$). For example, when the retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in space to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with discounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently introduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using retinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any active visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive fields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose that elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive fields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to future post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would otherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal disruptions is transiently blunted.</description>

      <title>Impact of Network Heterogeneity on Neuronal Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization dynamics is a phenomenon of great interest in many fields of science. One of the most important fields is neuron dynamics, as synchronization in certain regions of the brain is related to some of the most common mental illnesses. To study the impact of the network heterogeneity in the neuronal synchronization, we analyze a small-world network of non-identical Chialvo neurons that are electrically coupled. We introduce a mismatch in one of the model parameters to introduce the heterogeneity of the network. Our study examines the effects of this parameter mismatch, the noise intensity in the stochastic model, and the coupling strength between neurons on synchronization and firing frequency. We have identified critical values of noise intensity, parameter mismatch, and rewiring probability that facilitate effective synchronization within the network. Furthermore, we observe that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory connections plays a crucial role in achieving global synchronization. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms driving synchronization dynamics in complex neuron networks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Communication Costs in Neural Networks: The Role of Dendritic Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of biological neuronal networks has profoundly influenced the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, neurons utilized in ANNs differ considerably from their biological counterparts, primarily due to the absence of complex dendritic trees with local nonlinearities. Early studies have suggested that dendritic nonlinearities could substantially improve the learning capabilities of neural network models. In this study, we systematically examined the role of nonlinear dendrites within neural networks. Utilizing machine-learning methodologies, we assessed how dendritic nonlinearities influence neural network performance. Our findings demonstrate that dendritic nonlinearities do not substantially affect learning capacity; rather, their primary benefit lies in enabling network capacity expansion while minimizing communication costs through effective localized feature aggregation. This research provides critical insights with significant implications for designing future neural network accelerators aimed at reducing communication overhead during neural network training and inference.</description>

      <title>When does compositional structure yield compositional generalization? A kernel theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations support this ability; however, the conditions under which they are sufficient for the emergence of compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed, compositionally structured representations. This provides a tractable framework for characterizing the impact of training data statistics on generalization. We find that these models are limited to functions that assign values to each combination of components seen during training, and then sum up these values ("conjunction-wise additivity"). This imposes fundamental restrictions on the set of tasks compositionally structured kernel models can learn, in particular preventing them from transitively generalizing equivalence relations. Even for compositional tasks that they can learn in principle, we identify novel failure modes in compositional generalization (memorization leak and shortcut bias) that arise from biases in the training data. Finally, we empirically validate our theory, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks (convolutional networks, residual networks, and Vision Transformers) trained on a set of compositional tasks with similarly structured data. Ultimately, this work examines how statistical structure in the training data can affect compositional generalization, with implications for how to identify and remedy failure modes in deep learning models.</description>

      <title>STNAGNN: Data-driven Spatio-temporal Brain Connectivity beyond FC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the analysis of brain fMRI, yet defining the connectivity between ROIs remains a challenge in noisy fMRI data. Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning shared structure across environments facilitates rapid learning and adaptive behavior in neural systems. This has been widely demonstrated and applied in machine learning to train models that are capable of generalizing to novel settings. However, there has been limited work exploiting the shared structure in neural activity during similar tasks for learning latent dynamics from neural recordings. Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of related solutions and propose a novel approach for meta-learning this solution space from task-related neural activity of trained animals. Specifically, we capture the variabilities across recordings on a low-dimensional manifold which concisely parametrizes this family of dynamics, thereby facilitating rapid learning of latent dynamics given new recordings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on few-shot reconstruction and forecasting of synthetic dynamical systems, and neural recordings from the motor cortex during different arm reaching tasks.</description>
