      <title>Benchmarking a fading window: electroweak baryogenesis in the C2HDM, LHC constraints after Run 2 and prospects for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe remains one of the most pressing open questions in particle physics and cosmology. Electroweak baryogenesis offers an experimentally testable explanation, requiring new sources of CP violation and a strong first-order electroweak phase transition.The Two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is the simplest scalar extension of the Standard Model that can accommodate both ingredients. We critically assess the viability of the complex 2HDM (C2HDM) (a 2HDM with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and a single source of explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector) as a framework for electroweak baryogenesis, incorporating for the first time a comprehensive set of LHC Run 2 results at 13 TeV. By defining CP-violating benchmark planes tailored for a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, we identify regions of parameter space motivated by electroweak baryogenesis that will be testable at the LHC, and at future space-based gravitational wave experiments. The benchmark planes are intended to guide ongoing efforts in defining representative scenarios for the exploration of CP-violation in extended scalar sectors at the LHC Run 3 and beyond, while also assessing the emerging synergy between the LHC and future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. We also quantify the current tension between the realisation of electroweak baryogenesis and the non-observation of the electron electric dipole moment (EDM), finding that the predicted electron EDMs typically exceed the experimental limits by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Very Heavy Dark Matter in the Earth with Tau Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter accumulates in the center of the Earth as the planet plows through the dark matter halo in the Milky Way. Possible annihilation of dark matter to Standard Model particles can be probed in indirect dark matter searches. Among possible messengers, neutrinos are uniquely ideal as they can escape dense regions. Therefore, neutrino telescopes, with their large volume and broad energy exposures, offer new opportunities to search for dark matter signals from the center of the Earth. However, such studies have been restricted to dark matter masses below $\sim$ PeV as the Earth becomes opaque to very-high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we demonstrate that neutrino telescopes operating at TeV-PeV energies can probe very heavy dark matter particles if they annihilate to tau neutrinos or tau leptons. Here, we report upper limits on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon cross section for masses between $10^5$ GeV and $10^{10}$ GeV by using 7.5 years of IceCube high-energy starting event observations. Our results motivate detailed analyses in IceCube and other upcoming neutrino telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Towards testing $(g-2)_\tau$ in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$: radiative corrections and projections for Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arguably most promising avenue towards testing physics beyond the Standard Model in the anomalous magnetic moment of the $\tau$ proceeds via suitably constructed asymmetries in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ in the presence of a polarized electron beam. Such a program, as could be realized at Belle II assuming a polarization upgrade of the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider, crucially relies on a careful consideration of radiative corrections. In this work, we present the complete one-loop result for the fully polarized $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ process and its implementation in the Monte-Carlo integrator McMule. As an application, we discuss projections relevant for measurements at Belle II, both with and without electron polarization, and outline the necessary steps for a generalization to next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-less double beta decay in the $\nu$ Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the $3+3$ Type-I seesaw model for a broad range of right-handed mass scales (from keV to 10 TeV). We take into account and, in some cases, update the constraints from a large number of high- and low-energy experiments and study the implications on neutrino-less double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. We illustrate our findings through profile likelihood plots for the half-life $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$ and two-dimensional plots correlating $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$ to neutrino masses. We find that in this simple class of models for Majorana neutrino masses, current and next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments have a broad discovery potential in both the normal and inverted orderings of the spectrum of light active neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Precise Standard-Model predictions for polarised Z-boson pair production and decay at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing accurate theoretical predictions in the Standard Model for processes with polarised electroweak bosons is crucial to understand more in-depth the electroweak-symmetry breaking mechanism and to enhance the sensitivity to potential new-physics effects. Motivated by the rapidly increasing number of polarisation analyses of di-boson processes with LHC data, we carry out a comprehensive study of the inclusive production of two polarised Z bosons in the decay channel with four charged leptons. We perform a detailed comparison of fixed-order predictions obtained with various Monte Carlo programs which rely on different signal-definition strategies, assessing non-resonant and interference effects by contrasting polarised results with unpolarised and full off-shell ones. For the first time, we accomplish the combination of NNLO QCD and NLO EW corrections, setting the new state-of-the-art perturbative accuracy for polarised Z-boson pairs at the LHC. The impact of parton-shower matching and multi-jet merging is investigated by scrutinising calculations obtained with event generators that are typically used in experimental analyses. Integrated and differential results are discussed in a realistic fiducial setup and compared to publicly available ATLAS results.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Bosons Driving Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons (ULBs) can form macroscopic superradiant clouds around spinning black holes. We show that for scalar ULB masses $\mu \sim 10^{-22}-10^{-21}$ eV boson cloud dynamical friction drives supermassive black hole (SMBH) final-parsec evolution in $\lesssim 1$ Gyr and suppresses the nanohertz gravitational wave background with turnover. Considering century-monitored OJ287 system, we place novel bounds restricting ULB mass range $\mu \simeq (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV independent of any dark matter assumptions and show ULB drag can also efficiently reconcile any future confirmations of the debated orbital decay excess. Forthcoming pulsar timing array data and precise SMBH orbital timings will decisively test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Violation of energy conditions and the gravitational radius of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using recent lattice QCD results for gravitational form factors, we show that the Wigner-Weyl transform of the QCD energy-momentum tensor is of exotic type IV (in the Hawking-Ellis classification) in the interior of the proton, implying that in this region: (i) it has no causal eigenvectors, (ii) it violates all (linear, point-wise) energy conditions, (iii) there are local Lorentz frames in which its energy density is zero. This occurs because of the nonzero $T^{0i}$ flux associated with the angular momentum form factor $J(t)$. The energy-momentum tensor turns into a type I tensor, characteristic of ``ordinary matter", at radial distances of $1-2$ proton Compton wavelengths. This transition point defines a ``gravitational radius" for the proton, whose precise determination requires accurate knowledge about QCD form factors for momentum transfer beyond $\sqrt{-t}=2$~GeV.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the WIMP quality problem and R-parity violation in natural supersymmetry with all axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supersymmetric models where the mu problem is solved via discrete R-symmetries, then both the global U(1)_{PQ} (Peccei-Quinn, needed to solve the strong CP problem) and R-parity conservation (RPC, needed for proton stability) are expected to arise as accidental, approximate symmetries. Then in some cases, SUSY dark matter is expected to be all axions since the relic lightest SUSY particles (LSPs) can decay away via small R-parity violating (RPV) couplings. We examine several aspects of this {\it all axion} SUSY dark matter scenario. 1. We catalogue the operator suppression which is gained from discrete R-symmetry breaking via four two-extra-field base models. 2. We present exact tree-level LSP decay rates including mixing and phase space effects and compare to results from simple, approximate formulae. 3. Natural SUSY models are characterized by light higgsinos with mass ~100-350 GeV so that the dominant sparticle production cross sections at LHC14 are expected to be higgsino pair production which occurs at the 10^2-10^4 fb level. Assuming nature is natural, the lack of an RPV signal from higgsino pair production in LHC data translates into rather strong upper bounds on nearly all trilinear RPV couplings in order to render the SUSY signal (nearly) invisible. Thus, in natural SUSY models with light higgsinos, the RPV-couplings must be small enough that the LSP has a rather high quality of RPC.</description>

      <title>Quantization Rules in Holographic QCD Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quasinormal modes in holographic QCD models from the perspective of the WKB approximation. We derive the generalized Bohr Sommerfeld quantization rules for quasi-stationary states in holographic QCD models. As a simple application of these formulas, we compute the quasinormal modes of scalar and vector fields in the soft wall model, where an analytic expression for the real part of the frequency can be found in the low temperature regime. Additionally, this study provides useful insights into the dissociation process in holographic QCD models.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum entanglement in $\Lambda \bar{\Lambda}$ pair production via electron-positron annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of quantum entanglement in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pairs produced via electron-positron annihilation, specifically through the decay $J/\psi \to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$. By analyzing the angular correlations of the subsequent weak decays $\Lambda \to p\pi^-$ and $\bar{\Lambda} \to \bar{p}\pi^+$, we derive normalized observables $\mathcal{O}_i~(i=0,1,\ldots,4)$ that distinguish entangled states from separable ones. Theoretical predictions for these observables are established, with violations of separable-state bounds serving as unambiguous signatures of entanglement. Experimental measurements at $\cos\theta_\Lambda = 0$ yield $\mathcal{O}_{1\text{min}}^{\text{Observed}} = -0.7374\pm 0.0011\pm 0.0016$, significantly exceeding the classical limit of $-0.5$ with a statistical significance of 124.9$\sigma$. For $\left|\cos\theta_\Lambda\right|&lt;0.4883$, the observed $\mathcal{O}_{1}^{\text{Observed}}$ consistently exhibits $\mathcal{O}_{1}^{\text{Observed}} &lt; -\frac{1}{2}$ with a statistical significance of at least 5$\sigma$. Since $69.3\%$ of the decay events involving $\Lambda\to p+\pi^-$ and $\bar{\Lambda}\to \bar{p}+\pi^+$ are spacelike-separated, our results confirming the persistence of quantum entanglement in the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ system provide strong support for the non-locality of quantum mechanics. The findings are consistent with theoretical expectations under decoherence-free conditions, highlighting the potential of hyperon pairs as probes for fundamental quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism called sphalerogenesis to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). The BAU is explained by a CP-violating decay of the electroweak sphaleron. We introduce a dimension-six operator constructed from weak gauge fields: $Q_{\widetilde{W}} \sim \Lambda^{-2} \epsilon_{ijk} \widetilde{W}_{\mu \nu}^{i} W^{j \nu \rho} W_{\rho}^{k\mu}$. We find that the BAU can be explained if the cutoff scale satisfies $37.8 \,{\rm TeV} &lt; \Lambda &lt; 38.6\,{\rm TeV}$. This scenario can be tested by electron electric dipole moment measurements in the near future.</description>

      <title>Light Axion-Like Particles at Future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that appear in many new physics scenarios, with masses spanning a broad range. In this work, we systematically study the production and detection prospects of light ALPs at future lepton colliders, including electron-positron and multi-TeV muon colliders. At lepton colliders, light ALPs can be produced in association with a photon or a $Z$ boson. For very light ALPs ($m_a &lt; 1$ MeV), the ALPs are typically long-lived and escape detection, leading to a mono-$V$ ($V = \gamma, Z$) signature. In the long-lived limit, we find that the mono-photon channel at the Tera-$Z$ stage of future electron-positron colliders provides the strongest constraints on ALP couplings to SM gauge bosons, $g_{aVV}$, thanks to the high luminosity, low background, and resonant enhancement from on-shell $Z$ bosons. At higher energies, the mono-photon cross section becomes nearly energy-independent, and the sensitivity is governed by luminosity and background. At multi-TeV muon colliders, the mono-$Z$ channel can yield complementary constraints. For heavier ALPs ($m_a &gt; 100$ MeV) that decay promptly, mono-$V$ signatures are no longer valid. In this case, ALPs can be probed via non-resonant vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, where the ALP is exchanged off-shell, leading to kinematic deviations from SM expectations. We analyze constraints from both light-by-light scattering and electroweak VBS, the latter only accessible at TeV-scale colliders. While generally weaker, these constraints are robust and model-independent. Our combined analysis shows that mono-$V$ and non-resonant VBS channels provide powerful and complementary probes of ALP-gauge boson interactions.</description>

Abstract: A multi-component weakly-interacting dark matter scenario is analyzed, where the candidate dark matter states arise from the $SU(2)_{D}\to Z_{3}^{D}\times Z_{2}^{\text{acc}}$ symmetry breaking triggered by a VEV-developing scalar in the $J=3/2$ representation. While the discrete symmetries guarantee at least two stable states, a closer look at the mass orderings of the contrived dark sector reveals the existence of a third dark matter candidate, whose stability effectively results from the tight phase space in the dark boson sector. Regions of masses and couplings where the three dark states furnish a comparable contribution to the observed relic abundance are determined numerically.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic and weak decay of singly Heavy Baryons (Qqq)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy-to-heavy exclusive semileptonic transitions of singly heavy baryons (SHBs) are investigated within the framework of the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (hCQM). The six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved in the variational approach to calculate the ground state masses of bottom and charmed baryons. The transition magnetic moments and radiative $M1$ decay widths are calculated using the spin-flavour wave function and the effective quark masses of constituent baryon. The Isgur-Wise function (IWF) is determined at zero recoil to compute the $b \rightarrow c$ semileptonic decay. Additionally, the branching ratios, as well as the slope and convexity parameters of IWF are evaluated and compared with results from other studies.</description>

      <title>Quest for a phenomenologically consistent low cutoff theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Randall-Sundrum model with the Higgs localized on the IR brane solves the gauge hierarchy problem. However, the associated low cutoff ($\Lambda \sim 10$ TeV) generically leads to unacceptably rapid nucleon decay and excessively large Majorana neutrino masses. Achieving consistency while simultaneously explaining the Yukawa hierarchy requires either a horizontal symmetry or a discrete gauged symmetry. We demonstrate that eliminating all dangerous operators within a horizontal symmetry framework must come with large and unattractive charge assignments, if possible at all. Hence, we consider an exact discrete gauged $\mathbf{Z}_N$ symmetry, with fermion mass hierarchies generated via wavefunction overlap. We employ this to reproduce the current CKM and PMNS structures. Under minimal assumptions, it predicts Dirac neutrinos with a total mass $\sim 66$ meV. Since the $\mathbf{Z}_N$ charges must be generation-blind, flavor observables serve as key probes.</description>

      <title>$t$-Channel Dark Photon Search at Fixed-Target Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $t$-channel ($e^+ e^- \to \gamma A'$) contribution to the invisible dark photon ($A'$) searches at the electron fixed-target configurations. For illustration, we consider both the disappearing positron track signature at Belle II and the large missing energy search at NA64$e$. When the dark photon has a narrow decay width, the $t$-channel process can dominate over its $s$-channel and bremsstrahlung counterparts around $m_{A'} \simeq 60\,\rm{MeV}$ ($m_{A'} \simeq 200\,\rm{MeV}$) for Belle II (NA64$e$), to enhance the corresponding sensitivity on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ by a factor of up to approximately 3 (1.3). For Belle II, we further perform a multi-bin analysis with the spectrum information to better separate the background and signal channels for significant improvement of the sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the radiative transitions of predicted triple-charm molecular hexaquarks, which play a significant role in understanding their overall spectroscopic properties. As experimentally measurable quantities, the radiative decay widths provide insights into the internal structures of these triple-charm molecular hexaquarks. Additionally, we calculate their corresponding magnetic moments, which, together with the radiative decay widths, offer a comprehensive picture of the electromagnetic properties of these exotic states. This information is valuable for guiding future experimental searches and advancing our understanding of these unique hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Window quantities for the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment in spacelike and timelike domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relations between the window quantities for the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ in spacelike and timelike domains are studied. Two types of window functions (abrupt and smooth) as well as two kinds of kinematic intervals (symmetric and asymmetric with respect to the spacelike/timelike flip) are addressed. It is shown that the evaluations of the window quantities for $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ represented in terms of the hadronic vacuum polarization function, the Adler function, and the $R$-ratio of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons are mutually equivalent only if the additional contributions due to the window edge effects are properly taken into account and the explicit expressions for such contributions are derived. The obtained results enable one to accurately compare the window quantities for $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ based, e.g., on MUonE or lattice data with the ones based on $R$-ratio data, even if the window function covers different kinematic ranges in spacelike and timelike domains.</description>

Abstract: We review the recently published PDF sets MSHT20xNNPDF40_an3lo and MSHT20xNNPDF40_an3lo_qed, which have been obtained by combining the approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) sets of parton distributions (PDFs) from the MSHT20 and NNPDF4.0 series. We investigate the impact of the most recent results on N$^3$LO splitting functions onto the two PDF sets. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of N$^3$LO PDFs on the computation of Higgs production cross-sections at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Invariant-mass threshold resummation for the production of four top quarks at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using invariant-mass threshold resummation, we compute the invariant-mass distribution and the total cross section for $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production at the LHC with centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV at NLL' accuracy. This accuracy includes next-to-leading logarithmic contributions together with relative $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ non-logarithmic terms present in the threshold limit. We match the NLL' results to NLO in QCD and to complete NLO with electroweak corrections. We find that the inclusion of NLL' soft-gluon corrections significantly reduces the size of the theoretical uncertainties and greatly improves the convergence of the predictions when considering various choices of renormalisation and factorisation scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytic expressions for the one-loop QCD helicity amplitudes contributing to top-quark pair production in association with a photon or a jet at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), evaluated through $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the dimensional regularisation parameter, $\epsilon$. These amplitudes are required to construct the two-loop hard functions that enter the NNLO QCD computation. The helicity amplitudes are expressed as linear combinations of algebraically independent components of the $\epsilon$-expanded master integrals, with the corresponding rational coefficients written in terms of momentum-twistor variables. We derive differential equations for the pentagon functions, which enable efficient numerical evaluation via generalised power series expansion method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic decomposition of QCD splitting functions into scalar dipole radiators and pure splitting remainders up to second order in the strong coupling. The individual components contain terms that are formally sub-leading in soft or collinear scaling parameters, but well understood and universal due to their origin in scalar QCD. The multipole radiator functions which we derive share essential features of the known double-soft and one-loop soft gluon currents, and are not based on kinematical approximations.</description>

      <title>Double $\phi$-meson production via $\bar{p}p$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate double $\phi$ production in $\bar{p}p$ reactions near threshold using an effective Lagrangian approach, highlighting a significant OZI rule violation through hadronic processes. Our model includes $t$- and $u$-channel contributions from the nucleon and $s$-wave $N^*$ resonances ($N^*(1535,1650,1895)$), as well as the pentaquark-like state $P_s(2071)$. In the $s$-channel, scalar ($f_0$), tensor ($f_2$), and pseudoscalar ($\eta(2225)$) mesons are incorporated. The $N$, $N^*$, $f_0$, and $f_2$ contributions enhance the cross-section and generate peak structures near $W=2.2$ GeV, consistent with JETSET data, while cusp structures arise from $\bar{\Lambda}\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Sigma}\Sigma$ threshold openings. Polarization observables, such as the spin density matrix element (SDME), further elucidate the underlying hadronic mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interactions facilitate inter-particle redistribution of energy within the dense regions of galactic halos, implying modifications in the density and velocity distribution of dark matter. Simulating dark-matter only isolated halos for a wide range of mass and specific self-scattering cross-sections, we make a systematic study of the impact of self-scattering on the velocity distribution profiles. We report a conservative bound on $\sigma/m$ $\leq 2.7 \rm cm^2/gm$ at $95\%$ C.L. from observations of rotation curves in Milky-Way size galaxies. Sub-leading bounds from LSB galaxy and clusters are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the branching fraction of $B \to D^{(*)} \,\tau \, \nu_{\tau}$ and $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\, \tau\, \nu_{\tau}$ within the Relativistic Independent Quark Model, emphasizing the harmonic potential model-dependent analysis of these decay channels in the precision flavor physics era. Considering the experimental observation of longitudinal $\tau$-polarization and fraction of longitudinal polarization ($F_L$) at LHCb and Belle, we have also investigated these observables within our model framework which are aligning well with the standard model expectations. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the form factors across the whole accessible kinematic range of $q^2$. Our results are consistent and agree well with other theoretical approaches as well as with the experimental measurements. Furthermore, we evaluated the clean ratios of $B_s$ to $B_0$ in the semimuonic mode that are in accordance with the LHCb measurements, and support the validity of the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Although the concept of new physics is facing a significant challenge at the current TeV scale, semileptonic $B$ decays, nevertheless, always serve as a valuable probe to study the decay dynamics.</description>

      <title>A fully relativistic treatment of EMRIs in collisionless environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter provides a pedagogical introduction to theoretical studies of hadrons based on the fundamental theory of strong interactions - Quantum ChromoDynamics. A perturbative expansion in the strong coupling is not applicable at hadronic energy scales. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics is the formulation of the fundamental theory on a discrete space-time grid, which enables first-principles, systematically improvable, numerical simulations of strong interaction physics. This chapter explains how the masses of strongly stable and strongly decaying hadrons are determined. The strongly decaying hadrons have to be inferred from the corresponding scattering processes. Therefore, one of the main aims is to describe how the scattering amplitudes are extracted from a lattice simulation. The examples of spectra, widths, and scattering amplitudes are shown for conventional as well as exotic hadrons.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the production of the as-yet-undetected true muonium within the quark-gluon plasma formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, employing a relativistic Boltzmann transport framework coupled to viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The obtained effective cross sections for central collisions are 1.23~$\mu b$ in AuAu collisions with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$~GeV and 14.2~$\mu b$ in PbPb collisions with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$~TeV, resulting in a yield of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ true muonium per billion $AA$ collisions at RHIC and the LHC, respectively. This establishes heavy-ion collisions as a promising process for detecting true muonium.</description>

Abstract: Formal field theory requires, even in the presence of a Brout-Englert-Higgs effect, to maintain manifest non-perturbative gauge invariance. The Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism allows nonetheless an augmented perturbative treatment. We perform such an augmented tree-level analysis for the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We find that, as for the standard model, corrections to standard perturbation theory are only sub-leading.</description>

      <title>Detectability of the Phase Transition Gravitational Waves in the DFSZ axion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18703v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on using gravitational waves to explore axions and the dynamics of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking at high energy scales in the early universe. To accurately quantify the capability of specific gravitational wave experiments to probe the axion properties, it is crucial to perform precise calculations of gravitational wave signals based on given axion models and to conduct detailed detectability analysis tailored to the experimental configurations. Therefore, in this work, we consider the widely-studied DFSZ axion model and, for the first time, perform precise calculations of the phase transition dynamics parameters and associated gravitational wave signals. Our results demonstrate that the DFSZ model allows a strong first-order phase transition for the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking process at high energy scales exceeding $10^{9}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Moreover, by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational waves and comparing it with the thresholds of the Cosmic Explorer detector, we find that these signals are observable by the Cosmic Explorer with the energy scale range from $10^9~\mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{12}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Notably, through Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that if Cosmic Explorer detectors observe these gravitational waves, the bubble wall velocity will be the first parameter to be determined. This study demonstrates that gravitational wave detection offers a powerful approach to investigating axion dynamics complementary to other experiments.</description>

      <title>Insight into the nature of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related pentaquarks</title>

Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of pentaquark states from different perspectives to better understand their nature, internal structure, and quantum numbers, determine their hadronization processes, and shed light on their true nature. The present study examines the magnetic moments of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related hidden-charm pentaquark states with and without strangeness ($[d d][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd ][s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$ and $[s s][d c] \bar c$), employing a comprehensive analysis that encompasses both the compact pentaquark configuration and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. The present study compares the results regarding the magnetic moment of the $P_{c}(4457)$ pentaquark state with those reported in the existing literature. The numerical results obtained in this study, when considered alongside existing literature, indicate that the magnetic moments of hidden-charm pentaquark states may offer insights into their underlying structures, which in turn can inform the distinction between their spin-parity quantum numbers. It seems that for the future experimental search of the family of hidden-charm pentaquark states, studying the electromagnetic properties of the hidden-charm pentaquark states can provide valuable information.</description>

      <title>Holography and the internal structure of charmonium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic models that consider classical vector fields in a 5-d background provide successful effective descriptions for heavy vector meson spectra. This holds both in the vacuum and in a thermal medium, like the quark gluon plasma. However, it is somehow mysterious the way that these phenomenological models work. In particular, what is the role of the fifth dimension and what is the relation between the holographic 5-d background and the physical (4-d) heavy mesons. Hadrons, in contrast to leptons, are composite particles with some internal structure, that depends on the energy at which they are observed. In this work, a static meson is represented by a heavy quark-antiquark pair with an interaction described by a Nambu Goto string living in the same 5-d background that provides field solutions leading to masses and decay constants of charmonium states. The interaction potential that shows up is linear for large distances with a string tension consistent with the effective Cornell potential. Introducing temperature $T$ in the background it is found, for the $J/\psi$ case, that there is a deconfining transition at some critical value of $T$. The results obtained indicate that the 5-d background is effectively representing the internal structure of the (static) charmonium (quasi) states.</description>

      <title>The nature of $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two decades ago the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ was discovered in the hadron spectrum with two heavy quarks. The discovery fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of so called XYZ exotics states lying outside the conventional quark model, as well as theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, with the potential of disclosing new information about the fundamental strong force. Among the XYZs, the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ stand out for their striking characteristics and unlashed many discussions about their nature. Here, we address this question using the Born--Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory (BOEFT) and show how QCD settles the issue of their composition. Not only we describe well the main features of the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ but obtain also predictions in the bottomonium sector. This opens the way to systematic applications of BOEFT to all XYZs.</description>

      <title>A string loop origin for dark radiation and superheavy dark matter in type IIB compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the significance of string loop corrections, in a perturbative moduli stabilization scenario, focusing on their role in unraveling the origin of dark radiation in the late cosmological epoch and their correlation to dark matter. More specifically, a detailed analysis is provided in which the mass hierarchy of the normalized fields in the K{\"a}hler moduli sector is determined by the scales of the integer fluxes and the quantum corrections. Furthermore, we compute the previously underestimated contributions to the decay rates of moduli to axions, which behave as dark radiation, highlighting their connection to the aforementioned higher-order corrections. Two contrasting reheating scenarios (low-scale and high-scale) are provided, depending on the decay rate of the longest-lived particle into the Standard Model degrees of freedom through a Giudice-Masiero mechanism, while the effective number of neutrino species $\Delta N_{eff}$ remains below the respective bounds. Finally, a non-thermal dark matter scenario is proposed based on the decays of heavy scalar fields, where the main production mechanisms are investigated, leading to a dark matter candidate mass ranging from a few $GeV$ up to $10^{12}\; GeV$.</description>

      <title>An effective field theory for muon conversion and muon decay-in-orbit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon conversion is one of the best probes of charged lepton flavor violation. The experimental limit is soon expected to improve by four orders of magnitude, thus calling for precise predictions of the shape of the signal spectrum. Equally important are precise predictions for muon decay-in-orbit, the main background for muon conversion. While the calculation of electromagnetic corrections to the two processes above the nuclear scale does not involve significant challenges, it becomes substantially more complex below that scale due to multiple scales, bound-state effects and experimental setup. Here, we present a systematic framework that addresses these challenges by resorting to a series of effective field theories. Combining Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), Non-Relativistic QED (NRQED), potential NRQED, Soft-Collinear Effective Theory I and II, and boosted HQET, we derive a factorization theorem and present the renormalization group equations. Our framework allows for the proper calculation of precise predictions for the rates of the two processes, with crucial implications for the upcoming muon conversion searches. We also provide the most accurate prediction of the signal shape for those searches.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

      <title>Prospecting bipartite Dark Matter through Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational wave probes of a two-component dark matter framework, consisting of an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar and a Standard Model singlet fermion. The triplet scalar dark matter typically remains underabundant in the region below $\sim 1.9$ TeV, due to the strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge mediated interactions. We introduce a second dark matter component, an $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like Dirac fermion, to address this deficit in the dark matter relic abundance within a sub-TeV range. A key aspect of the proposed setup is the potential dark matter inter-conversion between the two components, which impacts the dark matter freeze-out dynamics and relic density of individual dark matter components. In such a scenario, we examine the properties of electroweak phase transition and identify the regions of parameter space that exhibit strong first-order phase transition. We estimate the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and its detectability, which could be probed through the conventional power-law-integrated sensitivity limits and the recently proposed peak-integrated sensitivity curves. Our analysis reveals that a novel region of the model's parameter space, compatible with dark matter observables, can generate a detectable gravitational wave spectrum, observable by upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, and DECIGOcorr, while also offering complementary detection prospects in the dark matter and collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking with a massless dark photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dark gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (dark GMSB) in a theory with a new unbroken $U(1)_{D}$ local symmetry and massless dark photon. Messenger fields charged under both Standard Model and dark gauge symmetries produce new soft supersymmetry-breaking terms due to gauge kinetic mixing between $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge and $U(1)_D$. We show that large kinetic mixing induces significant distortions to the superpartner spectra relative to conventional GMSB. Notably, shifts in the Higgs soft masses impact the conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking, lowering the $\mu$ parameter and yielding a relatively light Higgsino that may be accessible at the LHC. Furthermore, for very simple messenger representations, a very light bino-dark photino mixed state is present in the spectrum, which may be probed through exotic Higgs boson decays at future Higgs factories. We also examine the cosmological and phenomenological consequences of the messengers, the lightest of which is absolutely stable and carries fractional electric charge.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the systematic uncertainties and potential biases arising from the inclusion of large-$x$ corrections to proton and deuteron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data in global quantum chromodynamics (QCD) analyses. Using the CTEQ-JLab framework, we examine various approaches to implementing higher-twist corrections in nucleon structure functions and off-shell PDF modifications in deuteron targets. We analyze how these components interact and influence the determination of the $d$-quark PDF and the neutron structure function at large $x$. We find that it is very important to consider isospin-dependent higher-twist corrections in order to minimize implementation biases in the extracted quantities.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Phase Transitions: Why Thermal History of Hidden Sector Matters in Analysis of Pulsar Timing Array Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz frequency range from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations offers new insights into evolution of the early universe. In this work we analyze gravitational wave data from PPTA, EPTA, and NANOGrav, as arising from a supercooled first-order phase transition within a hidden sector, characterized by a broken $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. Several previous works have discussed challenges in producing observable {PTA signal} from supercooled phases transitions. We discuss these challenges and show how they are overcome by inclusion in part of the proper thermal history of the hidden and the visible sectors. The analysis of this work demonstrates that thermal histories of hidden and visible sectors profoundly influence the gravitational wave power spectrum, an aspect not previously explored in the literature. Further, the analysis of this work suggests that supercooled phase transitions not only align with the Pulsar Timing Array observations but also show promise for gravitational wave detection by future gravitational wave detectors. Our analysis shows that the dominant contribution to the gravitational wave power spectrum for PTA signals comes from bubble collision while the sound wave and turbulence contributions are highly suppressed. It is also found that all the PTA events are of detonation type while deflagration and hybrid events are absent. The analysis presented in this work provides a robust framework for further investigations on the origin of gravitational wave power spectrum in the early universe and for their experimental observation in the future.</description>

      <title>Possible origin of the KM3-230213A neutrino event from dark matter decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of the highest energy neutrino event with 220 PeV energy, detected recently by the KM3NeT experiment to be originating from heavy dark matter (DM) decay. Considering a heavy right handed neutrino (RHN) DM for illustrative purpose, we show that DM mass of 440 PeV, can explain the observed flux. The required DM lifetime to produce the best-fit value of the neutrino flux saturates the existing gamma-ray bounds. Due to the large uncertainty in the flux, it is possible to explain the KM3NeT event from RHN DM decay at $3\sigma$ confidence level (CL) while being in agreement with gamma-ray bounds and non-observation of similar events at IceCube. While we consider a gauged $B-L$ scenario where DM relic can be generated due to other interactions, we also briefly discuss some alternate DM possibilities where the gamma-ray bounds can be alleviated compared to the minimal RHN DM discussed here.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Goldstone Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes: Gravitational Wave Signatures and Implications for KM3-230213A Event at KM3NeT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many well-motivated new physics models, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) from U(1) symmetry breaking emerges as a promising dark matter candidate. Its coupling, suppressed by the symmetry breaking scale, prevents thermal equilibrium in the early Universe for high scale symmetry breaking. Thus, pNGB dark matter is predominantly produced via non-thermal mechanisms, such as the freeze-in process through a new portal coupling. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism for the production of pNGB dark matter even with feeble Higgs portal coupling-arising from Hawking radiation or superradiance of primordial black holes. We systematically investigate the production of light and heavy pNGB dark matter, both for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. We also discuss its potential gravitational wave signatures from domain wall collapse, density perturbations, and Hawking radiation. If the ultraviolet (UV) model is considered, the recent $\mathcal{O}$(100) PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A at KM3NeT can be naturally explained.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative heavy quark diffusion coefficients in a weakly magnetized thermal QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the heavy quark (HQ) momentum ($\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients are computed in a weak background magnetic field. The formalism adopted here involves calculation of the in-medium potential of the HQ in a weak magnetic field, which then serves as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator in the calculation of HQ self-energy ($\Sigma$). The self-energy determines the scattering rate of HQs with light thermal partons, which is subsequently used to evaluate $\kappa$ and $D_s$. It is observed that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low temperature. The spatial diffusion coefficient $2\pi T D_s$, exhibits good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be applied to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies. An extension of this formalism to the case of finite HQ momentum has also been attempted.</description>

Abstract: In the context of future electroweak precision measurements at the Future Circular Lepton Collider (FCC-ee), we consider recent proposals aimed at finding signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, we focus on recent novel suggestions for very precise direct measurements of $\alpha_{\rm e m}(M_Z^2)$. It is shown that at a level of precision of order $10^{-5}$, the effects of a dark photon may be very significant.</description>

Abstract: A highly under-looked problem in string models of hadronization is taking into account the mass of the parton system and the conservation of the total angular momentum, as these factors can significantly influence the time-space picture of the fragmentation process. In this paper, I present a method to properly define the Nambu-Goto relativistic string with non-zero mass based on the finite order eigenfunction expansion of the initial conditions of the Cauchy problem for string motion. The principles of the fragmentation process are derived for these strings. 4-momentum and total angular momentum conservation laws are taken into account, along with Virasoro conditions. It is shown that very non-trivial consequences arise for non-zero mass strings, including the discrete spectrum of string spin, the discreteness of the possible string breaking points, the close-to-Regge behavior of the spin-mass relation for the light string fragments and the natural stopping mechanism for fragmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes bridge a gap between introductory quantum field theory (QFT) courses and state-of-the-art research in scattering amplitudes. They cover the path from basic definitions of QFT to amplitudes relevant for processes in the Standard Model of particle physics. The book begins with a concise yet self-contained introduction into QFT, including perturbative quantum gravity. It then presents modern methods for calculating scattering amplitudes, focusing on tree-level amplitudes, loop-level integrands and loop-integration techniques. These methods help reveal intriguing relations between gauge and gravity amplitudes, and are of increasing importance for obtaining high-precision predictions for collider experiments, such as those at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, as well as for foundational mathematical physics studies in QFT, including recent applications to gravitational wave physics. These course-tested lecture notes include numerous exercises with detailed solutions. Requiring only minimal knowledge of QFT, they are well-suited for MSc and PhD students as a preparation for research projects in theoretical particle physics. They can be used as a one-semester graduate level course, or as a self-study guide for researchers interested in fundamental aspects of QFT. Supplementary material, Mathematica notebooks, corrections and further information are provided and maintained at the dedicated website https://scattering-amplitudes.mpp.mpg.de/scattering-amplitudes-in-qft/ .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict that neutrino sources following the matter distribution of the universe result in an anisotropy in the neutrino sky imprinted by the local large-scale structure. We calculate the level of this anisotropy and explore how it depends on the cosmological evolution of neutrino sources. We show how the level of anisotropy can be amplified when a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum is considered, introducing an effective neutrino horizon. This effect might allow for future neutrino detectors to measure a neutrino anisotropy associated with the local large-scale structure. Measurement of the level of this anisotropy along with features of the neutrino spectrum will allow observers to constrain the cosmological evolution of neutrino sources, which at ultrahigh energies (UHEs) are also expected to be the sources of UHE cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing Monte Carlo electromagnetic transport models, finding good agreement within EBL uncertainties.</description>

      <title>On Two Nucleons Near Unitarity with Perturbative Pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of perturbative pions on the Unitarity Expansion in the two-nucleon S-waves of Chiral Effective Field Theory at next-to-next-to leading order. Pion exchange explicitly breaks the nontrivial fixed point's universality and invariance under conformal and Wigner-$\SU(4)$ spin-isospin transformations. This Chiral Effective Field Theory applies tothe Unitarity Window (45deg&lt;delta(k)&lt;135deg,$k\approx m_\pi$) most relevant for low-energy nuclear systems. Its only LO scale is the scattering momentum; NLO adds only scattering length, effective range and non-iterated one-pion exchange (OPE); and N2LO only once-iterated OPE. Agreement in the 1S0 channel is very good. Apparent large discrepancies in the 3S1 channel at k&gt;100MeV are remedied by taking only the central part of the pion's N2LO contribution. In contradistinction to the tensor part, it is invariant under Wigner-SU(4)symmetry and hence identical in 1S0 and 3S1. NLO pions are Wigner-invariant. Both channels describe PWAs and pole parameters well within mutually consistent quantitative theory uncertainty estimates. Pionic effects are small, even for k&gt;mpi. Empirically determined breakdown scales agree well with $\Lambda_{NN}=\frac{16\pi f_\pi^2}{g_A^2M}=300\;$MeV where iterated OPE is not suppressed. We therefore conjecture: The footprint of both scale invariance and Wigner-symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion shows persistence,i.e. both dominate even for k=mpi and are more relevant than chiral symmetry,so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE does not enter before N3LO. We also discuss the potential relevance of entanglement power and possible resolution of a conflict with the strength of the tensor interaction in the large-Nc expansion.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ from lattice QCD: Complete short and intermediate windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present complete results for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ in the short- and intermediate-distance window regions, which account for roughly 10% and 35% of the total HVP contribution to $a_\mu$, respectively. In particular, we perform lattice-QCD calculations for the isospin-symmetric connected and disconnected contributions, as well as corrections due to strong isospin-breaking. For the short-distance window observables, we investigate the so-called log-enhancement effects as well as the significant oscillations associated with staggered quarks in this region. For the dominant, isospin-symmetric light-quark connected contribution, we obtain $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 48.139(11)_{\mathrm{stat}}(91)_{\mathrm{syst}}[92]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 206.90(14)_{\mathrm{stat}}(61)_{\mathrm{syst}}[63]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. We use Bayesian model averaging to fully estimate the covariance matrix between the individual contributions. Our determinations of the complete window contributions are $a^{{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu} = 69.05(1)_{\mathrm{stat}}(21)_{\mathrm{syst}}[21]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu} = 236.45(17)_{\mathrm{stat}}(83)_{\mathrm{syst}}[85]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. This work is part of our ongoing effort to compute all contributions to HVP with an overall uncertainty at the few permille level.</description>

      <title>Probing vector gravitational atoms with eccentric intermediate mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter (DM), are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we examine the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by the future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

Abstract: Domain walls represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of gravitational waves produced by scalar perturbations generated from the gravitational wave network. Our findings indicate that the gravitational wave spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future gravitational wave experiments aimed at exploring the role of domain walls in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Gluon Unpolarized, Polarized, and Transversity GPDs from Lattice QCD: Lorentz-Covariant Parametrization (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the matrix elements necessary to determine the leading-twist gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $H_g,~E_g,~\wt{H}_g,~\wt{E}_g,~H^T_g,~E^T_g, \wt{H}^T_g ,~\wt{E}^T_g$ in lattice QCD calculations. We present a method to achieve a Lorentz-covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of a linearly independent basis of tensor structures. This parameterization is crucial for projecting lattice QCD matrix elements onto light cone distributions. For the first time, we determine the corresponding components that project onto the linear combinations of invariant amplitudes, which reduce to the different gluon GPDs in the light cone limit and enable their separation in a lattice QCD calculation for spin-$0$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadrons. Hence, this work lays the foundation for the numerical determination of the gluon GPDs from first-principle lattice QCD calculations, directly advancing our understanding of the mass and spin structures and mechanical properties of the nucleon, as well as the physics underlying deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production in a range of experimental processes.</description>

      <title>Some insights on the partonic collectivity in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elliptic flow and Number of Constituent Quarks scaling provide crucial insights into the underlying dynamics and degrees of freedom in heavy-ion collisions. This article provides some insights on the transition from hadronic to partonic collectivity, revealing possible key signatures of medium evolution. At low energies around ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \leq 4.0$ GeV), $v_2$ may be negative and NCQ scaling might break down. We expect that as the collision energy rises beyond 4.0 GeV, $v_2$ may become positive and NCQ scaling gradually restores. The transition in $v_2$ behavior, coupled with the breakdown and restoration of NCQ scaling, highlights the increasing significance of partonic interactions at higher energies, marking the onset of partonic collectivity and the emergence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP)-like properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate for the first time the third-order spectrum of gravitational waves sourced by the amplified scalar field perturbations during inflation using the in-in formalism, and discuss the conditions for the third-order spectrum to be smaller than the second-order one. Assuming an exponential growth of the sub-horizon modes of the scalar field perturbations, we find that the third-order spectrum increases faster than the second-order one as the amplification of the field perturbations increases, and thus the third-order spectrum dominates for detectable gravitational waves, which indicates that the perturbation theory breakdowns.</description>

      <title>Semianalytic model for decaying dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semianalytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the Universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent-daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos' inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Antipodal self-duality of square fishnet graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In strongly-deformed planar ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, or fishnet theory, a point-split single-trace correlation function of four dimension-$m$ scalar operators is given by a single Feynman integral, which involves integrating over locations of a $m\times m$ grid of points. We show that for any integer $m$ this square fishnet graph is invariant under the combined action of a kinematic map and the antipode map of the Hopf algebra on multiple polylogarithms, i.e. it possesses an antipodal self-duality.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group approach to the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity: Amplification of the pairing gap from $\ell^4$ to $\ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\ell \neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic origin of primordial fluctuations in the Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a study of the effects of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalisation of stochastic inflation on the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a model-independent single-field context. We demonstrate how the scalar perturbations' Infra-Red (IR) contributions and the emerging Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution characterise the Langevin equations for the ``soft" modes in the quasi-de Sitter background. Both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion-dominated regimes undergo a specific analysis of the distribution function using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which helps us to evade a no-go theorem on the PBH mass. Using the EFT-induced alterations, we evaluate the local non-Gaussian parameters in the drift-dominated limit.</description>

      <title>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH} &gt; {\rm Max}[88 M_{\odot}/m_{\rm PBH}, 10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 M_{\odot})^{-0.09}]$ of DM.</description>

      <title>Realization of all-to-all fermion propagator for the first principle high accuracy strong interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a ``blending" algorithm that projects the all-to-all fermion propagator onto spatial low-frequency modes (LFM) combined with a stochastic estimate of spatial high-frequency modes (SHFM) at each time slice. This approach enables the calculation of arbitrary-point correlation functions for arbitrary hadron states in strongly interacting quantum field theories (QFT) with fermions, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, LFM allows the construction of spatially extended hadron states below a certain energy threshold by diagonalizing multi-fermion interpolation fields. Meanwhile, the local interactions required for N-point correlation functions in QFT can be approximated in an unbiased manner through a reweighted summation of both LFM and SHFM contributions. To demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm, we obtained {\color{black} $g_A^u=0.895(15)$, $g_A^d=-0.338(15)$, $g_A^s=-0.0245(72)$, $g_A^{u+d+s}=0.533(28)$ and $g_A^{u-d}=1.2339(43)$ } for nucleon at $m_{\pi}=300$ MeV and $a=0.077$ fm using 40 configurations. The consistency check of the pion electric form factor and charge radius derived from 3-point and 4-point correlation functions is also provided.</description>
