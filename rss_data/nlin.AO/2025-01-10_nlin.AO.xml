      <title>Frustration Induced Chimeras and Motion in Two Dimensional Swarmalators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarmalators are phase oscillators capable of simultaneous swarming and synchronization, making them potential candidates for replicating complex dynamical states. In this work, we explore the effects of a frustration parameter in the phase interaction functions of a two-dimensional swarmalator model inspired by the solvable Sakaguchi-swarmalators that move in a one-dimensional ring. The impact of the frustration parameter in these models has been a topic of great interest. Real-world coupled systems with frustration exhibit remarkable collective dynamical states, underscoring the relevance of this study. The frustration parameter induces various states exhibiting non-stationarity, chimeric clustering, and global translational motion, where swarmalators move spontaneously in two-dimensional space. We investigate the characteristics of these states and their responses to changes in the frustration parameter. Notably, the emergence of chimeric states suggests the crucial role of non-stationarity in phase interactions for spontaneous population clustering. Additionally, we examine how phase non-stationarity influences the spatial positions of swarmalators and provide a classification of these states based on different order parameters.</description>

      <title>Control of Overpopulated Tails in Kinetic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Adaptive High-Level Tight Control of Prostate Cancer: A Path from From Terminal Disease to Chronic Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastatic prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.</description>
