      <title>Event Camera Demosaicing via Swin Transformer and Pixel-focus Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has highlighted improvements in high-quality imaging guided by event cameras, with most of these efforts concentrating on the RGB domain. However, these advancements frequently neglect the unique challenges introduced by the inherent flaws in the sensor design of event cameras in the RAW domain. Specifically, this sensor design results in the partial loss of pixel values, posing new challenges for RAW domain processes like demosaicing. The challenge intensifies as most research in the RAW domain is based on the premise that each pixel contains a value, making the straightforward adaptation of these methods to event camera demosaicing problematic. To end this, we present a Swin-Transformer-based backbone and a pixel-focus loss function for demosaicing with missing pixel values in RAW domain processing. Our core motivation is to refine a general and widely applicable foundational model from the RGB domain for RAW domain processing, thereby broadening the model's applicability within the entire imaging process. Our method harnesses multi-scale processing and space-to-depth techniques to ensure efficiency and reduce computing complexity. We also proposed the Pixel-focus Loss function for network fine-tuning to improve network convergence based on our discovery of a long-tailed distribution in training loss. Our method has undergone validation on the MIPI Demosaic Challenge dataset, with subsequent analytical experimentation confirming its efficacy.

      <title>DIBS: Enhancing Dense Video Captioning with Unlabeled Videos via Pseudo Boundary Enrichment and Online Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Dive Into the BoundarieS (DIBS), a novel pretraining framework for dense video captioning (DVC), that elaborates on improving the quality of the generated event captions and their associated pseudo event boundaries from unlabeled videos. By leveraging the capabilities of diverse large language models (LLMs), we generate rich DVC-oriented caption candidates and optimize the corresponding pseudo boundaries under several meticulously designed objectives, considering diversity, event-centricity, temporal ordering, and coherence. Moreover, we further introduce a novel online boundary refinement strategy that iteratively improves the quality of pseudo boundaries during training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed technique components. By leveraging a substantial amount of unlabeled video data, such as HowTo100M, we achieve a remarkable advancement on standard DVC datasets like YouCook2 and ActivityNet. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art Vid2Seq across a majority of metrics, achieving this with just 0.4% of the unlabeled video data used for pre-training by Vid2Seq.</description>

      <title>SonicVisionLM: Playing Sound with Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production. However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations. In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision-language models(VLMs). Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful VLMs. When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content. This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models. To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed a time-controlled audio adapter. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, enhancing synchronization with the visuals, and improving alignment between audio and video components.

      <title>Analysis of Video Quality Datasets via Design of Minimalistic Video Quality Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays an indispensable role in monitoring and improving the end-users' viewing experience in various real-world video-enabled media applications. As an experimental field, the improvements of BVQA models have been measured primarily on a few human-rated VQA datasets. Thus, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of existing VQA datasets in order to properly evaluate the current progress in BVQA. Towards this goal, we conduct a first-of-its-kind computational analysis of VQA datasets via designing minimalistic BVQA models. By minimalistic, we restrict our family of BVQA models to build only upon basic blocks: a video preprocessor (for aggressive spatiotemporal downsampling), a spatial quality analyzer, an optional temporal quality analyzer, and a quality regressor, all with the simplest possible instantiations. By comparing the quality prediction performance of different model variants on eight VQA datasets with realistic distortions, we find that nearly all datasets suffer from the easy dataset problem of varying severity, some of which even admit blind image quality assessment (BIQA) solutions. We additionally justify our claims by contrasting our model generalizability on these VQA datasets, and by ablating a dizzying set of BVQA design choices related to the basic building blocks. Our results cast doubt on the current progress in BVQA, and meanwhile shed light on good practices of constructing next-generation VQA datasets and models.</description>
