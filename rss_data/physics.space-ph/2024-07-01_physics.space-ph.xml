      <title>First Results of the Magnetometer (MAG) Payload onboard Aditya-L1 Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aditya-L1 is the first Indian solar mission placed at the first Lagrangian (L1) point to study the Sun. A fluxgate magnetometer (MAG) is one of the seven payloads and one of the three in-situ payloads onboard to measure the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) coming from the Sun towards the Earth. At present, the Aditya-L1 spacecraft is in a halo-orbit around the L1 point and the MAG payload is ON is continuously measuring the IMF. This paper presents the first measurements of the IMF by MAG.</description>

      <title>Oblique Instability of Quasi-Parallel Whistler Waves in the Presence of Cold and Warm Electron Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whistler waves propagating nearly parallel to the ambient magnetic field experience a nonlinear instability that generates oblique electrostatic waves, including whistlers near the resonance cone that resemble oblique chorus in the Earth's magnetosphere. Focusing on the generation of oblique whistlers, earlier analysis of the instability is extended to the case where low-energy background plasma consists of both a "cold" population with energy ~ eV and a "warm" electron component with energy ~100 eV. This is motivated by observations in the Earth's magnetosphere where oblique chorus waves were shown to interact resonantly with the warm electrons. The main results are: i) the instability producing oblique whistlers is sensitive to the shape of the electron distribution at low energies. In the whistler range of frequencies, two distinct peaks in the growth rate are typically present: one at low wavenumbers associated with the warm population and one at high wavenumbers associated with the cold population; ii) the instability producing oblique whistler waves persists in cases where the temperature of the cold population is relatively high, including cases where cold population is absent and only the warm population is included; iii) particle-in-cell simulations show that the instability leads to heating of the background plasma and formation of characteristic resonant plateau and beam features in the electron distribution. The plateau/beam features have been previously detected in spacecraft observations of oblique chorus waves. However, they were attributed to external sources and were proposed to be the mechanism generating oblique chorus. In the present scenario, the causality link is reversed: the instability generating oblique whistler waves is shown to be a possible mechanism to generate the plateau/beam features.</description>

      <title>Spaceborne COTS-Capsule Hodoscope: Detecting and Characterizing Particle Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COTS-Capsule Spaceborne hodoscope was launched into low earth orbit aboard the International Space Station and operated during 2021-2022. The primary objectives of the payload are: measuring and characterizing the radiation environment within the space station; serving as a technology demonstrator for the COTS-Capsule radiation mitigation apparatus; and testing the interaction of high-energy cosmic particles in space with our detectors. The payload features a particle hodoscope equipped with an array of novel detectors based on polyvinyl toluene scintillators and silicon photomultiplier sensors that are used for radiation detection and characterization. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the construction, preflight performance, testing, qualification, and in-orbit calibration of the COTS-Capsule payload. The hodoscope, sensitive to ionizing cosmic particles, facilitates impinging particle track reconstruction, energy deposition estimation, and linear energy transfer estimation. In specific instances, it also provides particle identification and energy deposition estimation.</description>

      <title>Generation of Streaming Beam-Plasma Instability in Variable Lunar Plasma around Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-stream instability (TSI) is studied analytically in the lunar plasma environment. The electrons in the solar wind constitute the electron-beam and the lunar electron plasma constitutes the background plasma with which the electron-beam interacts to trigger the TSI. The lunar plasma is considered to have a variable proportion of the energetic (hot) electrons, 1% to 25% of the total lunar electrons, along with the bulk thermal (cold) population. The analysis shows that the presence of energetic electrons in the lunar plasma environment modify the TSI dispersion relation and can have a significant impact on the triggering of TSI and are capable of triggering nonlinear phenomena by making the lunar plasma system unstable.</description>

      <title>High-order finite-volume integration schemes for subsonic magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient dimension-by-dimension finite-volume method which solves the adiabatic magnetohydrodynamics equations at high discretization order, using the constrained-transport approach on Cartesian grids. Results are presented up to tenth order of accuracy. This method requires only one reconstructed value per face for each computational cell. A passage through high-order point values leads to a modest growth of computational cost with increasing discretization order. At a given resolution, these high-order schemes present significantly less numerical dissipation than commonly employed lower-order approaches. Thus, results of comparable accuracy are achievable at a substantially coarser resolution, yielding overall performance gains. We also present a way to include physical dissipative terms: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity and cooling functions, respecting the finite-volume and constrained-transport frameworks.</description>
