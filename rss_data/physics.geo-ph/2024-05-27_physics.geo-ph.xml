      <title>Application of the heat equation to the study of underground temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling underground temperatures provides a practical application of the one-dimensional heat equation. In this work, the one-dimensional heat equation in surface soil is extended to include heat carried by the vertical flow of rainwater through the soil. Analytical solutions, with and without water flow, illustrate the influence of rainwater circulation on the sub-surface propagation of seasonal temperature variations, an important effect that is generally neglected in textbooks. The surface temperature variations are damped by the soil, and this effect was used by the Troglodytae in Egypt or the Petra in South Jordan to insulate against extreme temperatures. For a realistic case of horizontally layered geology, a finite difference Python code was developed for the same purpose. Subsurface temperatures were also measured over a full year at depths up to 1.8 m and used to estimate the thermal skin depth and thermal wavelength. This study provides students with a practical example of how a textbook physics problem can be modified to extract information of contemporary importance in geophysics and global warming.</description>

      <title>A graph-space optimal transport FWI approach based on \kappa-generalized Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical basis for conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI) approaches is commonly associated with Gaussian statistics. However, errors are rarely Gaussian in non-linear problems like FWI. In this work, we investigate the portability of a new objective function for FWI applications based on the graph-space optimal transport and $\kappa$-generalized Gaussian probability distribution. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed objective function is robust in mitigating two critical problems in FWI, which are associated with cycle skipping issues and non-Gaussian errors. The results reveal that our proposal can mitigate the negative influence of cycle-skipping ambiguity and non-Gaussian noises and reduce the computational runtime for computing the transport plan associated with the optimal transport theory.</description>

      <title>On the theory of earthquakes: Paradoxical contradiction of Omori's law to the law of energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the main shock of an earthquake the aftershocks are observed. According to Omori's law, the frequency of aftershocks decreases hyperbolically over time. We noticed that, strictly speaking, Omori's law paradoxically contradicts the law of energy conservation. The contradiction is that the excitation of each aftershock consumes a finite portion of the source's energy, so that the total energy released by the source tends to infinity over time. The paradox is formally theoretical, but its analysis has proved useful. Eliminating the contradiction between Omori's law and the fundamental law of conservation of energy allowed us to further understand the nature of the phenomenological theory of aftershocks. We used the concept of deactivation of a source after the formation of a main rupture in it. We have based the theory on the original aftershock evolution equation, which has the form of a first-order linear differential equation. Two ways to eliminate the paradoxical situation are indicated. Key words: earthquake source, aftershock, evolution equation, deactivation coefficient, inverse problem, Omori epoch, source bifurcation, logistic equation, Hirano-Utsu formula.</description>

      <title>Dynamic regimes in planetary cores: {\tau}-{\ell} diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary cores are the seat of rich and complex fluid dynamics, in which the effects of rotation and magnetic field combine. The equilibria governing the strength of the magnetic field produced by the dynamo effect, the organisation and amplitude of the flow, and those of the density field, remain debated despite remarkable progress made in their numerical simulation. This paper proposes a new approach based on the explicit consideration of the variation of time scales {\tau} with spatial scales {\ell} for the different physical phenomena involved. The {\tau}-{\ell} diagrams thus constructed constitute a very complete graphic summary of the dynamics of the object under study. We highlight the role of the available convective power in controlling this dynamics, together with the relevant force balance, for which we derive a very telling {\tau}-{\ell} translation. Several scenarios are constructed and discussed for the Earth's core, shedding new light on the width of convective columns and on the force equilibria to be considered. A QG-MAC scenario adapted from Aubert [2019] gives a good account of the observations. A diversion to Venus reveals the subtlety and relativity of the notion of 'fast rotator'. We discuss scaling laws and their validity domain, and illustrate 'path strategies'. A complete toolbox is provided, allowing everyone to construct a {\tau}-{\ell} diagram of a numerical simulation, a laboratory experiment, a theory, or a natural object.
