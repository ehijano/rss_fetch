      <title>Lanczos for lattice QCD matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work found that an analysis formalism based on the Lanczos algorithm allows energy levels to be extracted from Euclidean correlation functions with faster convergence than existing methods, two-sided error bounds, and no apparent signal-to-noise problems. We extend this formalism to the determination of matrix elements from three-point correlation functions. We demonstrate similar advantages over previously available methods in both signal-to-noise and control of excited-state contamination through example applications to noiseless mock-data as well as calculations of (bare) forward matrix elements of the strange scalar current between both ground and excited states with the quantum numbers of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pion from top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions has been calculated from a top-down holographic QCD approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>

      <title>Confronting perturbative QCD with the hardest exclusive reactions: kaon electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among countless channels of hard exclusive reactions, the kaon electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) are of special interest, which have been measured up to $Q^2 \sim 50\;{\rm GeV}^2$ in the timelike domain. The kaon EMFFs thereby serve an ideal platform to critically examine the validity and effectiveness of perturbative QCD (pQCD) in accounting for hard exclusive processes. In this work we confront the pQCD predictions that incorporate the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative corrections, with the available kaon EMFFs data set from experimental measurements and from lattice predictions. The inclusion of the NNLO corrections turns out to have a substantial and positive impact. If the profiles of the kaon light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are taken from the recent lattice QCD prediction by {\tt LPC} Collaboration, the satisfactory agreement between theory and data can be reached for both charged and neutral kaons, in both spacelike and timelike large-$Q^2$ domains.</description>

      <title>Universal Euler-Cartan Circuits for Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently solve problems which are widely believed to lie beyond the reach of classical computers. In the near-term, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which efficiently embed quantum hardware in classical frameworks, are crucial in bridging the vast divide in the performance of the purely-quantum algorithms and their classical counterparts. Here, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is presented for the computation of non-perturbative characteristics of quantum field theories. The presented algorithm relies on a universal parametrized quantum circuit ansatz based on Euler and Cartan's decompositions of single and two-qubit operators. It is benchmarked by computing the energy spectra of lattice realizations of quantum field theories with both short and long range interactions. Low depth circuits are provided for false vacua as well as highly excited states corresponding to mesonic and baryonic excitations occurring in the analyzed models. The described algorithm opens a hitherto-unexplored avenue for the investigation of mass-ratios, scattering amplitudes and false-vacuum decays in quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that our results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the uncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be tested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to pion electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD radiative corrections to the pion electromagnetic form factor with large momentum transfer. We explicitly verify the validity of the collinear factorization to two-loop order for this observable, and obtain the respective IR-finite two-loop hard-scattering kernel in the closed form. The NNLO QCD correction turns to be positive and significant. Incorporating this new ingredient of correction, we then make a comprehensive comparison between the finest theoretical predictions and numerous pion form factor measurements in both space-like and time-like regions. Our phenomenological analysis provides strong constraint on the second Gegenbauer moment of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) obtained from recent lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <title>Dual chiral density wave induced oscillating Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is known to be induced from photon fields confined by a small volume, and also its fermionic counterpart has been predicted in a wide range of quantum systems. Here, we investigate what types of Casimir effects can occur from quark fields in dense and thin quark matter. In particular, in the dual chiral density wave, which is a possible ground state of dense quark matter, we find that the Casimir energy oscillates as a function of the thickness of matter. This oscillating Casimir effect is regarded as an analog of that in Weyl semimetals and is attributed to the Weyl points in the momentum space of quark fields. In addition, we show that an oscillation is also induced from the quark Fermi sea, and the total Casimir energy is composed of multiple oscillations.</description>
