      <title>Large Language Models as Realistic Microservice Trace Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17439v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Workload traces are essential to understand complex computer systems' behavior and manage processing and memory resources. Since real-world traces are hard to obtain, synthetic trace generation is a promising alternative. This paper proposes a first-of-a-kind approach that relies on training a large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic workload traces, specifically microservice call graphs. To capture complex and arbitrary hierarchical structures and implicit constraints in such traces, we show how to fine-tune LLMs to generate recursively, making call graph generation a sequence of easier steps. To further enforce learning constraints in traces and generate uncommon situations, we argue for applying additional instruction tuning steps to align our model with the desired trace features. Our evaluation results show that we can generate diverse realistic traces under various conditions and outperform existing methods in accuracy and validity. We demonstrate that our synthetically generated traces can effectively replace real data to optimize important microservice management tasks. Additionally, our model adapts to downstream trace-related tasks, such as predicting key trace features and infilling missing data.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Training on Low-Power Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training on edge devices poses several challenges as these devices are generally resource-constrained, especially in terms of power. State-of-the-art techniques at the device level reduce the GPU frequency to enforce power constraints, leading to a significant increase in training time. To accelerate training, we propose to jointly adjust the system and application parameters (in our case, the GPU frequency and the batch size of the training task) while adhering to the power constraints on devices. We introduce a novel cross-layer methodology that combines predictions of batch size efficiency and device profiling to achieve the desired optimization. Our evaluation on real hardware shows that our method outperforms the current baselines that depend on state of the art techniques, reducing the training time by $2.4\times$ with results very close to optimal. Our measurements also indicate a substantial reduction in the overall energy used for the training process. These gains are achieved without reduction in the performance of the trained model.</description>
