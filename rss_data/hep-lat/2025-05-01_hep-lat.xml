      <title>A Path to Quantum Simulations of Topological Phases: (2+1)D Wilson Fermions Coupled To U(1) Background Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a powerful approach to studying quantum field theories, particularly (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$), which hosts a rich landscape of physical phenomena. A key challenge in lattice formulations is the proper realization of topological phases and the Chern-Simons terms, where fermion discretization plays a crucial role. In this work, we analyze staggered and Wilson fermions coupled to $\text{U}(1)$ background gauge fields in the Hamiltonian formulation and demonstrate that staggered fermions fail to induce (2+1)D topological phases, while Wilson fermions admit a variety of topological phases including Chern insulator and quantum spin Hall phases. We additionally uncover a rich phase diagram for the two-flavor Wilson fermion model in the presence of a chemical potential. Our findings resolve existing ambiguities in Hamiltonian formulations and provide a theoretical foundation for future quantum simulations of gauge theories with topological phases. We further outline connections to experimental platforms, offering guidance for implementations on near-term quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $p\bar{\Omega}$ states and femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent researches on the $p \Omega$ and $p \bar{\Lambda}$ systems, we investigate the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems within the framework of a quark model. Our results show that the attraction between a nucleon and $\bar{\Omega}$ is slightly stronger than that between a nucleon and $\Omega$, suggesting that the $p \bar{\Omega}$ system is more likely to form bound states. The dynamic calculations indicate that the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems with both $J^{P}=1^{-}$ and $2^{-}$ can form bound states, with binding energies deeper than those of the $p \Omega$ systems with $J^{P}=2^{+}$. The scattering phase shift and scattering parameter calculations also support the existence of $p \bar{\Omega}$ states. Additionally, we discuss the behavior of the femtoscopic correlation function for the $p \bar{\Omega}$ pairs for the first time. Considering the significant progress in experimental measurements of the correlation function of the $p \Omega$ system, the further study of the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems using femtoscopic techniques will be a very valuable work.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Local Tadpole-Improvement in Quantum Simulations of Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new element in quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories, arising from spacetime-dependent quantum corrections in the relation between the link variables defined on the lattice and their continuum counterparts. While in Euclidean spacetime simulations, based on Monte Carlo sampling, the corresponding tadpole improvement leads to a constant rescaled value per gauge configuration, in Minkowski spacetime simulations it requires a state- and time-dependent update of the coefficients of operators involving link variables in the Hamiltonian. To demonstrate this effect, we present the results of numerical simulations of the time evolution of truncated SU(2) plaquette chains and honeycomb lattices in 2+1D, starting from excited states with regions of high energy density, and with and without entanglement.</description>

      <title>Long distance contributions to neutral $D$-meson mixing from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of neutral $D$-meson mixing provides a unique probe of long-distance effects in the charm sector, where Standard Model contributions are dominated by nonperturbative effects. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using spectral reconstruction techniques within lattice QCD to compute the long-distance contributions to $D^0- \bar{D}^0$ mixing. After outlining the general formalism describing neutral meson mixing in the charm sector, we focus on the determination of the mixing amplitudes and the dimensionless parameters $x = \Delta m_D / \Gamma_D$ and $y = \Delta \Gamma_D /(2 \Gamma_D)$, which respectively encode the mass and width differences between the $D$-meson mass eigenstates. We discuss in detail the required theoretical and computational framework, including the definition and renormalization of the four-quark operators entering the $\Delta C = 1$ weak Hamiltonian, and strategies for evaluating the relevant correlation functions employing variance-reduction techniques. To extract the mixing amplitudes, we explore methods for reconstructing the spectral density from lattice correlators, providing preliminary assessments of the data quality required to reach the scaling regime, where the smearing width is small enough to yield physically meaningful results. Our findings lay the groundwork for future precision determinations of long-distance contributions to $D$-meson mixing from first principles.</description>

      <title>QED corrections to meson masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our progress on calculating leading-order QED corrections to meson masses and bare quark masses. As lattice QCD calculations become more precise, these QED corrections are becoming more important. However, one of the challenges in adding QED effects to QCD calculations is avoiding power-law suppressed finite-volume effects. By using the recently introduced infinite-volume reconstruction method for QED, we are able to avoid this problem and perform calculations with exponentially-suppressed finite-volume effects.</description>

      <title>The impact of glasma on heavy flavor azimuthal correlations and spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological impact of the pre-equilibrium glasma initial stage of heavy-ion collisions on heavy quark azimuthal correlations and spectra. Using our numerical solver, we simulate the transport of heavy quark test particles in an SU(3) glasma background field. The glasma field equations are formulated using classical real-time lattice gauge theory, and the heavy quark dynamics are described by classical transport equations numerically solved using the colored particle-in-cell method. For the first time, the effect of the glasma stage on the azimuthal correlations of $c\overline{c}$ and $b\overline{b}$ pairs is studied. The resulting azimuthal width $\sigma_{\Delta\phi}$ exhibits a large and quick decorrelation due to the strong glasma fields. Further, we evaluate how the $p_T$-broadening in the glasma affects heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, which are initialized according to the Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) heavy quark production calculation. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is extracted for $c$ and $b$ quarks in the glasma and additional nuclear PDF effects accounting for gluon shadowing are included.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor angular correlations as a direct probe of the glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use classical equations of motion for heavy quarks to show that the pre-equilibrium glasma phase of a heavy ion collision has an extremely strong effect on heavy quark angular correlations. At the same time, the effect on the single inclusive spectrum is much more moderate. This suggests that $D\overline{D}$ meson angular correlations in future LHC measurements could provide direct experimental access to the physics of the pre-equilibrium stage.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay of Constraints from $B_s$, $D$, and $K$ Meson Mixing in $Z^\prime$ Models with Implications for $b\to s \nu\bar\nu$ Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within $Z^\prime$ models, neutral meson mixing severely constrains beyond the Standard Model (SM) effects in flavour changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. However, in certain regions of the $Z^\prime$ parameter space, the contributions to meson mixing observables become negligibly small even for large $Z^\prime$ couplings. While this a priori allows for significant new physics (NP) effects in FCNC decays, we discuss how large $Z^\prime$ couplings in one neutral meson sector can generate effects in meson mixing observables of other neutral mesons, through correlations stemming from $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge invariance and through Renormalization Group (RG) effects in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). This is illustrated with the example of $B_s^0-\bar B_s^0$ mixing, which in the presence of both left- and right-handed $Z^\prime bs$ couplings $\Delta_L^{bs}$ and $\Delta_R^{bs}$ remains SM-like for $\Delta_R^{bs}\approx 0.1\,\Delta_L^{bs}$. We show that in this case, large $Z^\prime bs$ couplings generate effects in $D$ and $K$ meson mixing observables, but that the $D$ and $K$ mixing constraints and the relation between $\Delta_R^{bs}$ and $\Delta_L^{bs}$ are fully compatible with a lepton flavour universality (LFU) conserving explanation of the most recent $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ experimental data without violating other constraints like $e^+ e^-\to\ell^+\ell^-$ scattering. Assuming LFU, invariance under the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry leads then to correlated effects in $b\to s\nu\bar\nu$ observables presently studied intensively by the Belle II experiment, which allow to probe the $Z^\prime$ parameter space that is opened up by the vanishing NP contributions to $B_s^0-\bar B_s^0$ mixing. In this scenario the suppression of $B\to K(K^*)\mu^+\mu^-$ branching ratios implies uniquely enhancements of $B\to K(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$ branching ratios up to $20\%$.</description>
