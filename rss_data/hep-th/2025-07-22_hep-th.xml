      <title>Cosmological correlators in gravitationally-constrained de Sitter states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmological correlators in de Sitter quantum gravity in the limit where $G_N \to 0$. This limit is distinct from a nongravitational QFT because the gravitational constraints still force states and observables to be de Sitter invariant. We first examine a class of perturbative correlators that, in gauge-fixed form, are represented by the expectation value of a product of elementary fields on the late-time boundary. We formulate Feynman rules for our computations and enumerate some necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that must be imposed on states and operators to avoid group-volume divergences. These correlators are conformally invariant in all allowed perturbative states but never coincide with QFT vacuum-expectation values. For instance, our sample computations yield interesting non-Gaussianities even when the underlying vacuum wavefunction is Gaussian. However, we show that, in the presence of a heavy background state, it is possible to construct a separate class of state-dependent relational observables whose values approximate QFT correlators in the vacuum. This illustrates a key contrast in quantum gravity -- between observables that are microscopically simple and observables whose expectation values in an appropriate background state lead to simple QFT-like correlators.</description>

      <title>On string theory on (deformed) $AdS_3\times \mathbb{T}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the fermionic string theory on $AdS_3\times \mathcal{N}$ with $k=1$, and its single-trace $T\bar T$ deformation, with a focus on the $(2,2)$ superstring on (deformed) $AdS_3\times \mathbb{T}^3$. In a certain limit, it is dual to the symmetric product of the ($T\bar T$-deformed) SCFT$_2$ on $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^3$. We present the winding-one delta-function normalizable worldsheet operators which, in the $k=1$ decoupling limit, correspond to those of $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^3$ in spacetime. We then demonstrate how their properties in string theory reproduce those of $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}^3$, or more generally, of a ($T\bar{T}$-deformed) $\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{N}$ seed of the boundary theory.</description>

      <title>A Partially Massless Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a Higgs mechanism for the partially massless graviton. In order to do so, we first construct a covariant fracton-like effective field theory on de Sitter space that linearly realizes a dipolar shift symmetry. The global symmetry of this theory can be gauged by coupling it to a partially massless spin-2 gauge field. When the fractonic matter condenses, the dipole symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Goldstone mode is a galileon and the partially massless graviton combines with this mode and becomes fully massive. At long distances, the phenomenology of this theory is captured by a quasi-topological field theory and displays many features analogous to those of the superconducting phase in electromagnetism, including gapless edge modes and persistent currents. We also describe the generalization to higher spins.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory is a framework that aims to improve the results of Hamiltonian truncation in a systematic, order-by-order fashion using Effective Field Theory methodology. The result is a truncated effective Hamiltonian with corrections that result from a matching procedure. We establish the rigor of this method by calculating nontrival next-to-leading order corrections in a $1/E_{\rm max}$ expansion, where $E_{\rm max}$ is our effective theory cutoff. We illustrate this explicitly using 1+1D $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, calculating corrections up to order $1/E_{\rm max}^3$. At this order, novel nonlocal contributions to the matching conditions must be incorporated. We show that by including these nonlocal terms, the error scales as $1/E_{\rm max}^4$, as expected from the Effective Field Theory power counting, providing a nontrivial check that this method is consistent and robust. We also estimate the critical coupling at which this theory flows to the 2D Ising conformal field theory and confirm that separation of scales, an essential feature of Effective Field Theory, persists at this order. These results establish Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory as a generic, systematic framework for improving convergence in Hamiltonian truncation and lay the groundwork to apply this method to more complex systems in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Pair production of massive charged vector bosons from the worldline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a worldline formulation for a massive spin-1 particle interacting with an electromagnetic background. Two first-quantized descriptions of the spin degrees of freedom are considered: one based on bosonic oscillators and the other on fermionic oscillators. Focusing initially on the bosonic model -- which can accommodate particles of arbitrary integer spin -- we review how quantization in the spin-1 sector, performed both via Dirac's method and BRST quantization, reproduces the free Proca field theory. We then introduce coupling to an external electromagnetic field and demonstrate that Maxwell's equations for the background emerge as a consistency condition for the nilpotency of the BRST charge on the spin-1 sector. Encouraged by this result, which proves the viability of the particle model, we proceed to construct a path integral quantization of the worldline action for the charged spin-1 particle on the circle. This yields the one-loop effective Lagrangian for a constant electromagnetic field induced by a massive charged vector boson. As expected, the result reveals a vacuum instability, which we quantify by deriving the pair production rate for the vector bosons, recovering previous results obtained in quantum field theory. For comparison, we repeat the analysis using the standard $\mathcal{N}=2$ spinning particle model, which contains fermionic worldline degrees of freedom, finding identical results. Finally, we comment on possible extensions of the worldline models to include effective interactions and briefly explore their implications for pair production.</description>

      <title>Regge Trajectories of N=4 SYM Part I: General Asymptotic Baxter-Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a novel set of equations - the Asymptotic Baxter--Bethe Ansatz - that determine the asymptotic spectrum of Regge trajectories in the BFKL regime of N=4 SYM. In this challenging limit, our method yields multi-loop results in the 't Hooft coupling, with the perturbative accuracy increasing as the quantum numbers grow. Our formalism not only provides a straightforward path to obtain multi-loop perturbative data, as we demonstrate, but also enables the classification of trajectories, paving the way for systematic non-perturbative studies up to the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of baryon symmetry in strongly coupled three-dimensional theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that baryon number symmetry is spontaneously broken in a class of three-dimensional, ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories with a discrete mass spectrum. These models serve as lower-dimensional, less-supersymmetric analogs of the Klebanov-Strassler solution, sharing properties such as the presence of a cascade. The spontaneous symmetry breaking is evidenced by the appearance of a Goldstone mode, which corresponds to a vector fluctuation in the gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Dynamics and Critical Phenomena in the Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black p-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive investigation of the non-linear evolution of the Aretakis instability in extremal black $p$-branes. Building on recent insights into the linear behavior of perturbations in near-horizon AdS$_{p+2} \times S^{D-p-2}$ geometries, we explore the full non-linear regime using a combination of analytical scaling arguments and numerical simulations. We uncover a universal critical behavior governed by scaling exponents that depend only on the spacetime dimension $D$ and the brane worldvolume dimension $p$. Near the threshold of instability, the system exhibits power-law evolution toward dynamically generated extremal attractors, while supercritical perturbations lead to singular growth. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute entanglement entropy, correlation functions, spectral densities, and out-of-time-ordered correlators in the dual field theory, finding universal scaling across all observables. These results establish a deep connection between geometric instability in the bulk and quantum information dynamics on the boundary. The emergence of universal scaling and phase transitions in extremal geometries suggests that non-linear Aretakis dynamics may serve as a general framework for studying holographic criticality and late-time behavior in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>On the One-Loop Exactness of Gravity Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that the two- and three-loop contributions to the partition function of three-dimensional gravity in flat space vanish. This is in agreement with the expected one-loop exactness dictated by the underlying symmetry at the quantum level. To highlight the distinctive nature of the $D=3$ case, we extend the three-loop computation to arbitrary spacetime dimensions $D$. In higher dimensions, the number of contributions increases substantially, reinforcing the view that one-loop exactness is a unique feature of three-dimensional gravity.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in momentum space: restoring CPT invariance of $\kappa$-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The positive and negative energy modes of a field theory in $\kappa$-Minkowski/$\kappa$-Poincar\'e noncommutative spacetime have very different symmetry properties. This can be understood geometrically by considering that they span two distinct sectors of a curved momentum space. It seems that because of this asymmetry, charge conjugation and Poincar\'e invariance are incompatible. However, the structure of momentum space suggests that time reversal could be deformed so that the overall CPT-invariance is restored. We test these features by calculating explicitly the whole set of Noether charges associated with continuous relativistic symmetries within the canonical formalism, and study their transformation properties under deformed discrete symmetries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlators in two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories by interpreting the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional gravity. To demonstrate the utility of the massive gravity framework as a particular realization of the gravitational interpretation, we show how the $T\bar{T}$-deformed correlators at finite coupling can be computed by adopting a judicious parametrization of the 2D metric and a preferred choice of zweibeins. To illustrate how this method works in practice, we compute the leading logarithmic contributions to two- and three-point functions to all orders in the $T\bar{T}$ coupling, reproducing a known result while producing new findings. This framework generalizes the random geometry approach to finite coupling.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative effects in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories: A toy model for Planckian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative completion of two-point correlators in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs), and analyze their behavior at distance scales shorter than the fundamental length scale set by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Building on the interpretation of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional quantum gravity with a unique built-in length scale, we advance the study of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs as a toy model for Planckian physics. As we probe shorter distances, trans-Planckian oscillations are followed by a super-Planckian regime in which correlations are typically suppressed by geometric randomness, in contrast to the power-law growth characteristic of CFTs. Moreover, their dependence on distance becomes exponentially weaker, suggesting that the underlying geometric structure has been largely erased -- a behavior broadly consistent with expectations for quantum spacetime in this regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify new families of duality-invariant theories of electrodynamics. We achieve this in two different ways. On the one hand, we present an algorithm to construct a one-parameter family of exactly duality-invariant theories from a single seed duality-invariant theory. If the seed theory is causal, the theories constructed from this method will also be causal when the parameter is non-negative. On the other hand, we find two additional novel families of duality-invariant theories which include a nonzero term independent of the electromagnetic field. The first of them generalizes Bialynicki-Birula electrodynamics, while the second family of theories features a well-defined Maxwell limit as the term independent of the gauge field strength is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>One Ring to Rule Them All: A Unified Topological Framework for 4D Superconformal Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified topological description of anomalies that generalizes the Chern-Simons formulation of Yang-Mills anomalies to encompass all 4-dimensional superconformal anomalies. The key innovation is our characterization of anomalies through the constraint ideal in the polynomial ring of generalized curvatures and connections of the underlying symmetry (super)-Lie algebra.
  We demonstrate that anomalies in dimension $d$ are captured by the cohomology $H_\delta(W_{d+2})$ of the generalized BRST operator $\delta$ acting on the fermion number $d+2$ component of the constraint ideal $W_{d+2}$. While Yang-Mills anomalies correspond to invariant Chern curvature polynomials (where $W_{d+2}$ reduces to homogeneous curvature polynomials), the constraint ideal for 4D (super)conformal gravity contains additional polynomials mixing curvatures and connections. This richer structure naturally explains the coexistence of both Chern-type ($a$) and non-Chern-type ($c$) anomalies in (super)conformal theories.</description>

      <title>Thermal correction on the Casimir energy in a Horava-Lifshitz Lorentz-violating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is considered a great triumph of Quantum Field Theory. Originally the Casimir energy was investigated considering the vacuum fluctuation associated with electromagnetic field; however it has also been analyzed considering different type of quantum fields. More recently the Casimir energy was studied in the context of Lorentz symmetry violation. In this work we investigate the effect of finite temperature on the Casmir energy considering a Lorenttz violation symmetry in a Horava-Lifshitz scenario. In this sense we consider a massive scalar quantum field confined in a region between two large and parallel plates. So our main objective is to investigate how, in this Lorentz violation scenario (LV), the Casimir energy depends on the temperature. Another point to be analyzed, is influence of the parameter associated with the LV, $\xi$, in the thermal correction.</description>

Abstract: The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a boundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new physics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the formal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge modes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the bulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs with boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be associated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in order to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the prediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall systems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a physical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum Field Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have non-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining symmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the boundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which also appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a possible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton quasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the algebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never proved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter, elasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this Thesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar gauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics in a rotating BTZ black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of the thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector outside a BTZ black hole, from a perspective of quantum thermodynamics. In the context of an open quantum system, we derive the complete dynamics of the detector, which encodes a complicated response to scalar background fields. Using various information theory tools, such as quantum relative entropy, quantum heat, coherence, quantum Fisher information, and quantum speed of evolution, we examined three quantum thermodynamic laws for the UDW detector, where the influences from BTZ angular momentum and Hawking radiation are investigated. In particular, based on information geometry theory, we find an intrinsic asymmetry in the detector's thermolization process as it undergoes Hawking radiation from the BTZ black hole. In particular, we find that the detector consistently heats faster than it cools, analogous to the quantum Mpemba effect for nonequilibrium systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spin of a black hole significantly influences the magnitude of the asymmetry, while preserving the dominance of heating over cooling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Quantum Corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined. We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of $4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.</description>

Abstract: Wheeler's spacetime foams (wormholes) at the Planck length undergo quantum nucleation, oscillation and annihilation. Their collective excitations over foamy spacetime interact with field operators at large distances. We describe such collective excitation and interaction using an effective ``foamon'' field coupled with field operators. The Wilson renormalisation group approach shows that the foamon field theory evolves from an infrared scaling invariant domain to an ultraviolet one, when numerous particles are present. In these domains, the foamon field induces an effective action of field operators, and its correlation length sets a natural scale. Applying this to cosmology, we obtain the effective Einstein action for the Ricci scalar and the cosmological constant (dark energy), including its equation of state and interaction with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I construct a set of master field equations encompassing all possible second-order field equations for spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity. The structure of 2-dimensional Horndeski theory is leveraged to define a spherically symmetric gravitational tensor that is identically conserved and can play an equivalent role as the Einstein tensor in the coupling to spherically symmetric stress-energy tensors. The master field equations provide a framework in which to study a wide variety of previously intractable problems and prove general results across different theories, as illustrated with the example of the Jebsen--Birkhoff theorem that holds generally. This work sets up the stage for the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity and provides powerful tools for the exploration of a new paradigm of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scaling in Energy Correlators Beyond the Confinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD scaling behavior of the small-angle Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC), focusing on the transition between its perturbative pre-confinement and non-perturbative post-confinement regimes. Applying the light-ray Operator Product Expansion (OPE), we develop a formalism that describes the scaling of the EEC with the input energy $Q$ in the transition and the post-confinement region, where the latter quantum scaling is determined by the $J=5$ DGLAP anomalous dimension. A key result of our work is a novel connection between the light-ray OPE and the dihadron fragmentation function (DFF), where we show that the non-perturbative OPE coefficients correspond to moments of the DFF. This finding establishes a new paradigm for studying hadronization. Our theoretical predictions are validated against Monte Carlo simulations for both $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, showing excellent agreement. The potential role of the quantum scaling in the precision determination of $\alpha_s$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetry enriched criticality in (3+1)d</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between two gapped phases: one in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and another where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits this transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Extracting Essential Non-perturbative Information in Jet Invariant Mass via the Bayesian Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new three-dimensional non-perturbative (NP) function to account for and parameterize the NP contributions in the jet invariant mass spectrum, in addition to the conventional NP mass shift parametrization. By implementing Bayesian analysis on experimental data of the jet invariant mass from exclusive $W/Z+$jet events and inclusive jet events in $pp$ collisions at RHIC and LHC, where collisional energy increases by a factor of up to $65$ from RHIC to LHC, we ensure the analysis covers a wide range of data. For the first time, we simultaneously extract NP contributions from hadronization, initial soft-gluon radiation, and underlying events, based on two different NP prescriptions. We find that the contribution from initial soft-gluon radiation is negligible, and the hadronization effect dominates in the small-$R$ region, while underlying events provide the dominant contribution in the large-$R$ region. Moreover, when only hadronization effects are considered, our results successfully describe the jet mass data measured in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where only hadronization effects are expected to be present. Our work offers quantitative insights into understanding the soft hadronic contribution to jet substructure.</description>

      <title>Ultrarelativistic limit of the Kerr theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original Kerr theorem provides the foundation for Kerr-Schild transformations by classifying all shear-free and geodesic null congruences in flat spacetime; the key ingredient of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. However, due to the high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its symmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically significant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example is the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to lead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we propose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the stationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance under null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions, the classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence is covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields an axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave displays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the exterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a special case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild black hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise to a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020 (2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization invariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the latter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar topology. These results emphasize how symmetry-based refinements of the Kerr theorem constitute a powerful tool to constructing physically essential spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Fluid Dynamics in Curved Spacetime: a Novel Effective Hamiltonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Eulerian (Hamiltonian) framework for relativistic fluid dynamics in curved spacetimes, with emphasis on Schwarzschild geometry. The key innovation lies in the consistent use of density and three-velocity fields, all defined in coordinate (Newtonian) time, while fully incorporating relativistic and curvature effects. {\it We stress that the entire dynamics is developed in coordinate (Eulerian) time, from the viewpoint of a static Eulerian observer.} In the non-relativistic regime, it is well known that Poisson brackets between the density $\rho(\vec{x}, t)$ and velocity fields $v^i(\vec{x}, t)$, together with an appropriate Hamiltonian, yield the continuity and Euler equations as Hamiltonian equations of motion. These field-theoretic Poisson brackets can be derived from canonical phase-space brackets defined on Lagrangian variables $(x_i, p_j)$, mapped to Eulerian fields $(\rho, v^i)$. We extend this framework to curved spacetime by constructing a relativistic version of the Eulerian Poisson algebra and proposing a corresponding Hamiltonian. This yields relativistic continuity and Euler equations valid in generic spacetimes, with evolution in coordinate time. Applying this to the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain exact stationary background solutions for radial flows and perform a perturbative stability analysis. We also introduce a generalised vorticity and examine its effect on perturbations over irrotational backgrounds, revealing its role in flow stability. This work offers a unified, first-principles Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics in curved geometries, forming a foundation for further study of astrophysical and cosmological fluid phenomena.</description>

      <title>From a collapsing radiating star to an evaporating black hole: A smooth transition from classical to quantum entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robust mechanism where the geometrical free-gravitational entropy of an isolated astrophysical radiating star undergoing continual gravitational collapse, as measured by an external observer, makes a smooth transition to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the onset of the horizon formation and in the late times of black hole evaporation. It is interesting to note that both in the classical regime and the semi classical evaporating black hole regime, the matter is radiated via the Vaidya exterior surrounding the radiating star, as well as the evaporating black hole. Our result, being independent of the interior matter dynamics of the collapsing star, clearly indicates that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its non-extensive nature indeed originates from the Riemannian geometry, which dictates the free-gravity entropy in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reliability of the large $N_f$ expansion of four-dimensional gauge-fermion quantum field theories, focusing on the structure and scheme dependence of the beta function. While the existence of a nontrivial UV fixed point at leading order in $1/N_f$ suggests the possibility of asymptotic safety, the absence of higher-order terms precludes robust conclusions. We analyze the impact of renormalization scheme transformations and show that higher-order corrections inevitably introduce increasingly singular contributions. We prove that at most one renormalization scheme can preserve the dominance of the leading contribution, rendering the truncation trustworthy; in all other schemes, higher-order terms dominate and the expansion becomes unreliable. This result places strong constraints on the physical interpretation of UV fixed points in large $N_f$ theories and emphasizes the need for resummation or non-perturbative control to establish asymptotic safety.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of an ``odd'' variant of the two-dimensional Ising Fradkin--Shenker model, characterized by a uniform background of static $e$ and $m$ charges. Using large-scale tensor network and exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram, identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic excitations are related by an enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation, translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking. Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond commensurate limits.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Scalar Sector of Grand Unification: Phenomenology &amp; Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) based on groups like $SO(10)$ and $SU(5)$ unify Standard Model (SM) fermions into irreducible representations (irreps), and predict additional scalar fields beyond the SM Higgs. In $SO(10)$ GUTs, the scalar fields can arise from irreps contributing to the Yukawa sector at the renormalisable level, such as $10_{\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\mathrm{H}}$, and $\overline{126}_{\mathrm{H}}$, or from $16_{\mathrm{H}}$ in non-renormalisable interactions. The direct implications of these scalars include the violation of baryon and lepton number, enabling processes such as nucleon decays, neutron-antineutron oscillation, and potentially accounting for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. We systematically analyse their couplings to SM fermions, identifying diquark and leptoquark interactions vertices involving all scalars residing in $10_{\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\mathrm{H}}$, $\overline{126}_{\mathrm{H}}$, and $16_{\mathrm{H}}$ and comprehensively assess their contributions to nucleon decay, neutron-antineutron oscillation, quark flavour violation, and baryogenesis. Constraints on the masses of these scalars, derived from experimental bounds on the aforementioned processes, are also estimated. Conventional GUTs rely on multiple scalar irreps to avoid unrealistic fermion mass relations; for example, minimal $SU(5)$ with $5_{\mathrm{H}}$ predicts degenerate down-quark and charged-lepton masses. We demonstrate that quantum corrections from heavy scalars in a minimally extended $SU(5)$ model can lift this degeneracy, thereby reducing the arbitrariness in the scalar sector, which has been called as indirect impact. This thesis provides a comprehensive examination of the scalar sector's role in GUTs, establishing connections between UV-complete models and observable phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering on Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of gravitational to electromagnetic waves in the presence of background magnetic fields is known as the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, analogous to the Primakoff effect for axions. Rephrasing this conversion as a classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Abelian-Higgs vortices in the background of a coherently oscillating axion field. We show that the electric field is induced in the magnetic core of the vortex due to the axion-photon conversion. Moreover, because the electromagnetic field is confined in the vortex and excluded from the superconducting bulk regions due to the Meissner effect, the vortex tube can be regarded as a cylindrical cavity, and our numerical analysis shows that the resonant cavity mode (TM010 mode) can be efficiently enhanced in this tube. We also focus on the interaction of two vortices in the oscillating axion background, resulting in attractive or repulsive forces, even in the case with the BPS limit. These new features open up a new possibility for the axion dark matter search using superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Weinberg's theorem, phantom crossing and screening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole solution obtained by smearing the point sources with a Gaussian distribution. We show that while the form of the metric function and the physical properties derived from that remain valid, not all the components of Einstein equations are satisfied. We construct an improved energy-momentum tensor that consistently satisfies Einstein equations and show that it leads to a different prediction for the region where the strong energy condition is violated. For certain choice of parameters, our proposal predicts the violation of the energy condition outside the Cauchy horizon, which might be important for observational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism for generating anisotropic enhancements of the curvature perturbation through a vector field is proposed. We find that when the mixing between the inflaton perturbation and the vector-field perturbation is sufficiently strong in the anisotropic inflation, the power spectrum becomes dominated by anisotropic constant modes. This suggests that statistical anisotropy in primordial black hole (PBH) formation may be inevitable if inflation undergoes an anisotropic inflationary phase. Our findings offer a novel approach to probe vector fields during inflation and to test the cosmic no-hair conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We perform a bordism computation to show that the $E_{7(7)}(\mathbb{R})$ U-duality symmetry of 4d $\mathcal N = 8$ supergravity could have an anomaly invisible to perturbative methods; then we show that this anomaly is trivial. We compute the relevant bordism group using the Adams and Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences, and we show the anomaly vanishes by computing $\eta$-invariants on the Wu manifold, which generates the bordism group.</description>

      <title>Celestial Holography Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the prescription commonly used to define holographic correlators on the celestial sphere of Minkowski space as an integral transform of flat space scattering amplitudes, known as celestial amplitudes. We propose a resolution to a discrepancy noted in the computation of celestial amplitudes, which arises from the regularisation and the commutation of a divergent integral in the definition of conformal primary wave functions. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, off-shell, prescription for holographic correlators on the celestial sphere which we refer to as celestial correlators. The latter are defined by the Mellin transform of bulk time-ordered correlators with respect to the radial direction in the hyperbolic slicing of Minkowski space, which are then extrapolated to the celestial sphere along the hyperbolic directions. This prescription is analogous to the extrapolate definition of holographic correlators in AdS/CFT and, like in AdS, is centered on (off-shell) correlation functions as opposed to (on-shell) S-matrix elements. We show that celestial correlators defined in this new way are manifestly recast in terms of corresponding Witten diagrams in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space in perturbation theory. We discuss the possibility of using this definition of celestial correlators in terms of bulk correlation functions to explore the non-perturbative properties of celestial correlators dual to conformal field theories in Minkowski space. We furthermore show that celestial amplitudes can also be defined by a similar extrapolation of S-matrices in position space via a Mellin transformation in the radial direction. This provides the proper regularisation of conformal primary wave functions, which is inherited from the corresponding Wightman functions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and factorization in axion-de Sitter universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Renyi entropies and late-time bulk correlators between a pair of asymptotically de Sitter space universes connected through an Euclidean axion wormhole, in arbitrary dimensions. Assuming the validity of the de Sitter (dS)/conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence, we calculate the holographic Renyi entropy between the pair of universes, anchoring the corresponding extremal surfaces to $\mathcal{I}^+$ in each universe. The results can be recast in terms of a reduced density matrix where one of the asymptotically dS universes is traced out, and where the throat of the Euclidean wormhole is associated with the entanglement between the universes. Later, we evaluate two-point correlation functions for heavy particles detected near $\mathcal{I}^+$. The Euclidean wormhole saddle point is responsible for the late-time saturation of the correlators. The result is compatible with each of the asymptotically de Sitter universes being described by a finite-dimensional quantum dual theory. At last, we dimensionally reduce these geometries in terms of dilaton-gravity theory with conformally coupled matter. Further, we discuss recent puzzles associated to the Euclidean path integral for extended wormhole geometries with multiple throats.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant, Dark Matter and the ElectroWeak Scale meet in the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Swampland program, which looks for low energy theories consistent with quantum gravity, has led to the introduction of a dark dimension stemming from the cosmological constant. We show that the same argument leads to the emergence of the electroweak scale, once the dark dimension is realised in a warped background. A second warped extra dimension at the TeV scale is, therefore, postulated, where the long-standing problem of the hierarchy between the electroweak and the Planck scales can be addressed. Furthermore, standard model contributions to the cosmological constant are tamed, together with the gravitational ones. In the emergent holistic picture of gravity and gauge interactions, both Planck and the electroweak scales are emergent from a theory with two fundamental scales: $10^{-2}$ eV and $10^{10}$ GeV, which are of geometric origin and, following the Distance Conjecture, natural. Hence, a bridge is established between the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>

Abstract: The horizon of black hole is surrounded by the photon sphere and an outside observer cannot easily examine the geometry inside the photon sphere. In this note, we propose a way to investigate the region from dual conformal field theory by making use of AdS/CFT correspondence. We first construct gravastar geometry as an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime, where the region inside the photon sphere is replaced by a horizon-less geometry. It is known that bulk-cone singularities in the retarded Green function in dual conformal field theory can encode the bulk null geodesics. We then compute numerically the retarded Green function from the bulk theory and observe bulk-cone singularities corresponding to null geodesics traveling into the interior region. In this way, we show that it is possible to examine the region inside the photon sphere from bulk-cone singularities of dual conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows, and is fairly generic. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions. For rolling solutions, we observe that the CEB is not always respected, but since these examples lack a cosmic horizon, the application of entropy bounds remains delicate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the marginal deformation of the symmetric-product orbifold theory Sym$_N(T^4)$ which corresponds to introducing a small amount of Ramond-Ramond flux into the dual $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ background. Already at first order in perturbation theory, the dimension of certain single-cycle operators is corrected, indicating that wrapping corrections from integrability must come into play earlier than expected. Our results provide a test for integrability computations from the mirror Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz or Quantum Spectral Curve, akin to the computation of the Konishi anomalous dimension in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. We also discuss a flaw in the original derivation of the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold. Together, these observations suggest that more needs to be done to correctly identify and exploit the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with conventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly large sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by their size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core structure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad class of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence to a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically acts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation rate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are longer lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial radius or more.</description>

Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology and propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric - that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved in time. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior, which gives a straightforward quantum representation of global de Sitter space. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity. The problem is equivalent to an $s$-wave scattering off a central power-law potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. Such a potential admits bound states, so the system is stable and the wavepacket undergoes unitary scattering. The radiation bounce, as opposed to the no-boundary bounce, does not have a classical counterpart as the corresponding classical solutions are singular. During the radiation bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

      <title>Observers seeing gravitational Hilbert spaces: abstract sources for an abstract path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral suggests a striking result: the Hilbert space of closed universes in each superselection sector, a so-called $\alpha$-sector, is one-dimensional. We develop an abstract formalism encapsulating recent proposals that modify the gravitational path integral in the presence of observers and allow larger Hilbert spaces to be associated with closed universes. Our formalism regards the gravitational path integral as a map from abstract objects called sources to complex numbers, and introduces additional objects called partial sources, which form sources when glued together. We apply this formalism to treat, on equal footing, universes with spatial boundaries, closed universes with prescribed observer worldlines, and closed universes containing observers entangled with external systems. In these contexts, the relevant gravitational Hilbert spaces contain states prepared by partial sources and can consequently have nontrivial $\alpha$-sectors supporting noncommuting operators. Within our general framework, the positivity of the gravitational inner product implies a bound on the Hilbert space trace of certain positive operators over each $\alpha$-sector. The trace of such operators, in turn, quantifies the effective size of this Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instantons, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why a recent attempt to compute the quenched entropy using one-eigenvalue instantons is unreliable due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.</description>

Abstract: According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff $\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the Minkowski limit should be approached.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce configuration space path integrals for quantum fields interacting with classical fields. We show that this can be done consistently by proving that the dynamics are completely positive directly, without resorting to master equation methods. These path integrals allow one to readily impose space-time symmetries, including Lorentz invariance or diffeomorphism invariance. They generalize and combine the Feynman-Vernon path integral of open quantum systems and the stochastic path integral of classical stochastic dynamics while respecting symmetry principles. We introduce a path integral formulation of general relativity where the space-time metric is treated classically. The theory is a candidate for a fundamental theory that reconciles general relativity with quantum mechanics. The theory is manifestly covariant, and may be inequivalent to the theory derived using master-equation methods. We prove that entanglement cannot be created via the classical field, reinforcing proposals to test the quantum nature of gravity via entanglement generation.</description>

Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the counterintuitive possibility of extracting entangled quantum states from a reference state of an auxiliary system (the "embezzler") via local quantum operations while hardly perturbing the latter. We uncover a deep connection between the operational task of embezzling entanglement and the mathematical classification of von Neumann algebras. Our result implies that relativistic quantum fields are universal embezzlers: Any entangled state of any dimension can be embezzled from them with arbitrary precision. This provides an operational characterization of the infinite amount of entanglement present in the vacuum state of relativistic quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We study the boundary criticality enriched by boundary fermions, which ubiquitously emerge in topological phases of matter, with a focus on topological insulators and topological superconductors. By employing dimensional regularization and bosonization techniques, we uncover several unprecedented boundary universality classes. These include the boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point and the special Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, both resulting from the interplay between edge modes and bulk bosons. We present a comprehensive sketch of the phase diagram that accommodates these boundary criticalities and delineate their critical exponents. Additionally, we explore a 1+1D conformal defect decorated with fermions, where a defect BKT transition is highlighted. We conclude with a discussion on potential experimental realizations of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high-density matter blobs that developed due to these fluctuations. We study here such a collapse, which are seeded by a scalar field $\phi$ associated to a non-trivial potential function $V(\phi)$, minimally coupled to gravity. Such a continual collapse is presumed to form a black hole always and is named a primordial black hole (PBH). Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the scalar field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) falls within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.</description>

      <title>A Majorana Relativistic Quantum Spectral Approach to the Riemann Hypothesis in (1+1)-Dimensional Rindler Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Hilbert-P\'olya approach to the Riemann Hypothesis, we present an exact spectral realization of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(z)$ with a Mellin-Barnes integral that explicitly contains it. This integral defines the spectrum of the real-valued energy eigenvalues $E_n$ of a Majorana particle in a $(1+1)$-dimensional Rindler spacetime or equivalent Kaluza-Klein reductions of $(n+1)$-dimensional geometries. We show that the Hamiltonian $H_M$ describing the particle is hermitian and the spectrum of energy eigenvalues $\{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is countably infinite in number in a bijective correspondence with the imaginary part of the nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(z)$ having the same cardinality as required by Hardy-Littlewood's theorem from number theory. The correspondence between the two spectra with the essential self-adjointness of $H_M$, confirmed with deficiency index analysis, boundary triplet theory and Krein's extension theorem, imply that all nontrivial zeros have real part $\Re ( z )=1/2$, i.e., lie on the ``critical line''. In the framework of noncommutative geometry, $H_M$ is interpreted as a Dirac operator $D$ in a spectral triple $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D)$, linking these results to Connes' program for the Riemann Hypothesis. The algebra $\mathcal{A}$ encodes the modular symmetries underlying the spectral realization of $\zeta (z)$ in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of Majorana wavefunctions, integrating concepts from quantum mechanics, general relativity, and number theory. This analysis offers a promising Hilbert-P\'olya-inspired path to prove the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Rotating Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Black Hole as a Particle Accelerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similar to particle accelerators, black holes also have the ability to accelerate particles, generating significant amounts of energy through particle collisions. In this study, we examine the horizon and spacetime structures of a rotating black hole within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity. Additionally, we extend the analysis to explore particle collisions and energy extraction near this black hole using the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. Our findings reveal that the mass and angular momentum of the colliding particles significantly influence the center of mass energy, more so than the parameters of the black hole itself. Furthermore, we apply the Banados-Silk-West mechanism to massless particles, particularly photons, while disregarding their intrinsic spin in plasma; an aspect that has not been previously explored. The Banados-Silk-West mechanism cannot be directly applied, as the refractive index condition only permits photon propagation, meaning that massive particles in vacuum cannot be included in this study. We derive the propagation conditions for photons and analyze photon collisions by treating them as massive particles in a dispersive medium. The impact of the plasma parameter on the extracted center of mass energy is also examined. Our results show that the plasma parameter has a relatively weak and unchanged effect on the center of mass energy across all cases, indicating that energy losses due to friction within the medium are a contributing factor.</description>

      <title>Radiative properties of a nonsingular black hole: Hawking radiation and gray-body factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the radiative properties of a spherical and singularity-free black-hole geometry recently proposed in the literature. Contrary to the Schwarzschild spacetime, this geometry is geodesically complete and regular, and, instead of the singularity, it presents a minimal surface that connects a trapped (black-hole) with an antitrapped (white-hole) region. The geometry is characterized by two parameters: the Schwarzschild radius and another parameter that measures the area of the minimal surface. This parameter is related to certain corrections expected in the context of loop quantum gravity to the classical general-relativistic dynamics. We explicitly compute the spectrum of the Hawking radiation and the gray-body factor. Since the gravitational potential is shallower than in Schwarzschild, the emission spectrum turns out to be colder and purer (less gray). From this, we sketch the evaporation history of this geometry and conclude that, under certain assumptions, instead of completely evaporating, the black hole naturally leads to a remnant, which provides a possible resolution to the information-loss issue.</description>

      <title>Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a charge operator supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher order conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian chiral kinetic theory with self-consistent semiclassical expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the chiral kinetic theory in a non-Abelian gauge field using a self-consistent semiclassical expansion. Within this new expansion scheme, we disentangle the Wigner equations up to second order and demonstrate that they do not introduce additional constraint equations. By integrating the covariant chiral kinetic equations in eight-dimensional phase space, we obtain the corresponding equations in seven-dimensional phase space. This reduction facilitates numerical simulations and practical applications.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to the physics of mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>
