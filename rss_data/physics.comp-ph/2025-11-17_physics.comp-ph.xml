      <title>BOA Constrictor: A Mamba-based lossless compressor for High Energy Physics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The petabyte-scale data generated annually by High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider present a significant data storage challenge. Whilst traditional algorithms like LZMA and ZLIB are widely used, they often fail to exploit the deep structure inherent in scientific data. We investigate the application of modern state space models (SSMs) to this problem, which have shown promise for capturing long-range dependencies in sequences. We present the Bytewise Online Autoregressive (BOA) Constrictor, a novel, streaming-capable lossless compressor built upon the Mamba architecture. BOA combines an autoregressive Mamba model for next-byte prediction with a parallelised streaming range coder. We evaluate our method on three distinct structured datasets in HEP, demonstrating state-of-the-art compression ratios, improving upon LZMA-9 across all datasets. These improvements range from 2.21$\times$ (vs. 1.69$\times$) on the ATLAS dataset to a substantial 44.14$\times$ (vs. 27.14$\times$) on the highly-structured CMS dataset, with a modest $\sim 4.5$MB model size. However, this gain in compression ratio comes with a trade-off in throughput; the Storage-Saving Rate ($\sigma_{SSR}$) of our prototype currently lags behind highly-optimised CPU-based algorithms like ZLIB. We conclude that while this Mamba-based approach is a highly promising proof-of-principle, significant future work on performance optimisation and hardware portability is required to develop it into a production-ready tool for the HEP community.</description>

      <title>Beyond quantum mean-field approximation: Phase-space formulation of many-body time-dependent density functional theory and efficient spectral approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a universal quantum mechanical approach to the dynamical many-body problem, the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) might be inadequate to describe crucial observables that rely on two-body evolution behavior, like the double-excitation probability and two-body dynamic correlation. One promising remedy is to utilize the time-dependent 2-reduced density matrix (2-RDM) that directly represents two-body observables in an N-particle system, and resort to the extended TDDFT for multibody densities to break the confines of spatial local on one-body density [Phys. Rev. Lett. 26(6) (2024) 263001]. However, the usage of 2-RDM is prohibitive due to the augmented dimensionality, e.g., 4-D space for unidimensional 2-RDM. This work addresses the high-dimensional numerical challenges by using an equivalent Wigner phase-space formulation of 2-RDM and seeking efficient spectral approximations to nonlocal quantum potentials. For spatial periodic case, a pseudo-difference operator approach is derived for both the Hartree-exchange-correlation term and two-body collision operator, while the discretization via the Chebyshev spectral element method is provided for non-periodic case. A massively parallel numerical scheme, which integrates these spectral approximations with a distributed characteristics method, allows us to make the first attempt for real simulations of 2-RDM dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the two-body correction to the quantum kinetic theory, and show the increase in the system's entropy induced by the two-bdoy interaction. Thus it may pave the way for an accurate description of 2-RDM dynamics and advance to a practical application of many-body TDDFT.</description>

      <title>Power law attention biases for molecular transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are the go-to architecture for most data modalities due to their scalability. While they have been applied extensively to molecular property prediction, they do not dominate the field as they do elsewhere. One cause may be the lack of structural biases that effectively capture the relationships between atoms. Here, we investigate attention biases as a simple and natural way to encode structure. Motivated by physical power laws, we propose a family of low-complexity attention biases $b_{ij} = p \log|| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j||$ which weigh attention probabilities according to interatomic distances. On the QM9 and SPICE datasets, this approach outperforms positional encodings and graph attention while remaining competitive with more complex Gaussian kernel biases. We also show that good attention biases can compensate for a complete ablation of scaled dot-product attention, suggesting a low-cost path toward interpretable molecular transformers.</description>

      <title>Correlated Purification for Restoring $N$-Representability in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography offers a scalable route to estimating properties of quantum states, but the resulting reduced density matrices (RDMs) often violate constraints that ensure they represent $N$-electron states -- known as $N$-representability conditions -- because of statistical and hardware noise. We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>SCULPT: An Interactive Machine Learning Platform for Analyzing Multi-Particle Coincidence Data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SCULPT (Supervised Clustering and Uncovering Latent Patterns with Training), a comprehensive software platform for analyzing tabulated high-dimensional multi-particle coincidence data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) experiments. The software addresses critical challenges in modern momentum spectroscopy by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with physics-informed analysis in an interactive web-based environment. SCULPT implements Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for non-linear dimensionality reduction to reveal correlations in highly dimensional data. We also discuss potential extensions to deep autoencoders for feature learning, and genetic programming for automated discovery of physically meaningful observables. A novel adaptive confidence scoring system provides quantitative reliability assessments by evaluating user-selected clustering quality metrics with predefined weights that reflect each metric's robustness. The platform features configurable molecular profiles for different experimental systems, interactive visualization with selection tools, and comprehensive data filtering capabilities. Utilizing a subset of SCULPT's capabilities, we analyze photo double ionization data measured using the COLTRIMS method for 3-body dissociation of the D2O molecule, revealing distinct fragmentation channels and their correlations with physics parameters. The software's modular architecture and web-based implementation make it accessible to the broader atomic and molecular physics community, significantly reducing the time required for complex multi-dimensional analyses. This opens the door to finding and isolating rare events exhibiting non-linear correlations on the fly during experimental measurements, which can help steer exploration and improve the efficiency of experiments.</description>

      <title>Counterintuitive Potential-Barrier Affinity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Improving conditional generative adversarial networks for inverse design of plasmonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a key tool for designing nanophotonic structures that manipulate light at sub-wavelength scales. We investigate how to inversely design plasmonic nanostructures using conditional generative adversarial networks. Although a conventional approach of measuring the optical properties of a given nanostructure is conceptually straightforward, inverse design remains difficult because the existence and uniqueness of an acceptable design cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the design space is often large, and simulation-based methods become quickly intractable. Deep learning methods are well-suited to tackle this problem because they can handle effectively high-dimensional input data. We train a conditional generative adversarial network model and use it for inverse design of plasmonic nanostructures based on their extinction cross section spectra. Our main result shows that adding label projection and a novel embedding network to the conditional generative adversarial network model, improves performance in terms of error estimates and convergence speed for the training algorithm. The mean absolute error is reduced by an order of magnitude in the best case, and the training algorithm converges more than three times faster on average. This is shown for two network architectures, a simpler one using a fully connected neural network architecture, and a more complex one using convolutional layers. We pre-train a convolutional neural network and use it as surrogate model to evaluate the performance of our inverse design model. The surrogate model evaluates the extinction cross sections of the design predictions, and we show that our modifications lead to equally good or better predictions of the original design compared to a baseline model. This provides an important step towards more efficient and precise inverse design methods for optical elements.</description>

      <title>Interpretable descriptors enable prediction of hydrogen-based superconductors at moderate pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room temperature superconductivity remains elusive, and hydrogen-base compounds despite remarkable transition temperatures(Tc) typically require extreme pressures that hinder application. To accelerate discovery under moderate pressures, an interpretable framework based on symbolic regression is developed to predict Tc in hydrogen-based superconductors. A key descriptor is an integrated density of states (IDOS) within 1 eV of the Fermi level (EF), which exhibits greater robustness than conventional single-point DOS features. The resulting analytic model links electronic-structure characteristics to superconducting performance, achieves high accuracy (RMSEtrain = 20.15 K), and generalizes well to external datasets. By relying solely on electronic structure calculations, the approach greatly accelerates materials screening. Guided by this model, four hydrogen-based candidates are identified and validated via calculation: Na2GaCuH6 with Tc =42.04 K at ambient pressure (exceeding MgB2), and NaCaH12, NaSrH12, and KSrH12 with Tc up to 162.35 K, 86.32 K, and 55.13 K at 100 GPa, 25 GPa, and 25 GPa, respectively. Beyond rapid screening, the interpretable form clarifies how hydrogen-projected electronic weight near EF and related features govern Tc in hydrides, offering a mechanism-aware route to stabilize high-Tc phases at reduced pressures.</description>

      <title>Comparative study and critical assessment of phase-field lattice Boltzmann models for laminar and turbulent two-phase flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase field lattice Boltzmann (LB) models have undergone continuous development, resulting in multiple variants widely used for simulating multiphase flows. However, direct performance comparisons remain limited, especially for three-dimensional cases. In this study, we present a systematic comparative analysis of several recent and representative phase-field LB models, covering four major categories: conservative Allen-Cahn, nonlocal Allen-Cahn, hybrid Allen-Cahn, and Cahn-Hilliard models. Their accuracy, numerical stability and mass/volume conservation are assessed through a series of canonical two-phase flow problems. Beyond the commonly tested two-dimensional laminar cases, we extend the evaluation to three-dimensional droplet-laden turbulent flows, which expose more critical limitations of the existing models. The results show that while all models perform satisfactorily in two dimensions, they still suffer from substantial droplet volume loss in turbulence, particularly at high Weber numbers. Overall, conservative Allen-Cahn-based LB models exhibit the most favorable balance of numerical stability, accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Differentiation Strategies for Acoustic Inverse Problems: Admittance Estimation and Shape Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.</description>

      <title>Assessment of a Nonlinear Unsteady Vortex Lattice-Vortex Particle Method for Predicting Helicopter Rotor/Multirotor Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a nonlinear unsteady vortex lattice-vortex particle method (NL-UVLM-VPM) for the efficient prediction of helicopter rotor aerodynamics. The approach couples a nonlinear unsteady vortex lattice method for aerodynamic modeling with a mesh-free vortex particle method for wake evolution. Nonlinear viscous effects, derived from two-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) sectional data, are incorporated through a low-cost viscous-inviscid alpha-coupling algorithm. To stabilize wake development, the Vreman eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model is integrated with the particle strength exchange (PSE) method within a large eddy simulation (LES) framework, enabling robust and accurate resolution of the wake coherent, transient, and turbulent breakdown regions. The solver further includes a novel adaptive particle conversion technique, reducing computational wall-clock time by nearly 70%, and a multiple-reference-frame kinematics formulation, allowing simulations of complex flight conditions such as forward flight and multi-rotor interactions. Validation against experimental and unsteady RANS (URANS) data for three representative benchmark cases shows good agreement in aerodynamic loads and wake structures. Moreover, the NL-UVLM-VPM achieves comparable accuracy to URANS, with over two orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost, demonstrating its potential as a reliable and efficient tool for rotorcraft aerodynamic studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is essential in many scientific and engineering domains. Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to deliver high simulation rate or high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads. This paper introduces the novel \algorithmpropernoun{} algorithm, designed to overcome these limitations. We apply this method and show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second and simulations achieving 84 PFLOP/s. Our implementation can achieve 90\% of peak performance in both single-node and clustered environments. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale running on a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems.</description>

Abstract: Digital Memcomputing machines (DMMs) are dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality) that have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Their corresponding ordinary differential equations depend on a few hyper-parameters that define both the system's relevant time scales and its phase-space geometry. Using numerical simulations on a prototypical DMM, we analyze the role of these physical parameters in engineering the phase space to either help or hinder the solution search by DMMs. We find that the DMM explores its phase space efficiently for a wide range of parameters, aided by the system-wide correlations in their fast degrees of freedom that emerge dynamically due to coupling with the (slow) memory degrees of freedom. In this regime, the time it takes for the system to find a solution scales well as the number of variables increases. When these hyper-parameters are chosen poorly, the system navigates its phase space far less efficiently. However, we find that, in many cases, collective behavior persists even when the phase-space exploration process is inefficient. This behavior only disappears if the memories are made to evolve as quickly as the fast degrees of freedom. This study points to the important role of memory and hyper-parameters in engineering the DMMs' phase space for optimal computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>

      <title>The advent of fully variational quantum eigensolvers using a hybrid multiresolution approach</title>

Abstract: In electronic structure theory, variational methods offer a valuable paradigm for approximating electronic ground states. However, for historical reasons, this principle is mostly restricted to model chemistries in pre-defined fixed basis sets. Especially in quantum computation, these model chemistries are far from an accurate description of the initial electronic Hamiltonian. This work demonstrates a \textit{fully} variational approach to the electronic structure problem by optimizing the orbitals that represent the second-quantized Hamiltonian, alongside a quantum circuit that generates the many-electron wavefunction. To this end, the orbitals are represented within an adaptive multi-wavelet format, guaranteeing numerical precision. We then present explicit numerical protocols and highlight the quantum circuit's role in determining the optimal orbital basis.</description>

Abstract: In signal processing, resampling algorithms can modify the number of resources encoding a collection of data points. Downsampling reduces the cost of storage and communication, while upsampling interpolates new data from limited one, e.g. when resizing a digital image. We present a toolset of quantum algorithms to resample data encoded in the probabilities of a quantum register, using the quantum Fourier transform to adjust the number of high-frequency encoding qubits. We discuss advantage over classical resampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Real-fluid behavior in rapid compression machines: Does it matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15887</link>

Abstract: Rapid compression machines (RCMs) have been extensively used to quantify fuel autoignition chemistry and validate chemical kinetic models. Historically, the analyses of experimental and modeling RCM autoignition data have been conducted based on the adiabatic core hypothesis where real-fluid behavior has been completely overlooked, though this might be significant at common RCM test conditions. This work presents a first-of-its-kind study that addresses two significant questions for autoignition studies within RCMs in the fundamental combustion community: (i) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect interpretation and analysis of RCM experimental data? and (ii) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect RCM autoignition modeling and the validation of chemical kinetic models? To this end, theories for real-fluid isentropic change are newly proposed and derived based on high-order Virial EoS, and are further incorporated into an effective-volume real-fluid autoignition modeling framework newly developed for RCMs. With detailed analyses, the strong real-fluid behavior in common RCM tests is confirmed, which can greatly influence the interpretation of RCM autoignition experiments, particularly the determination of end-of-compression temperature and evolution of the adiabatic core in the reaction chamber. Furthermore, real-fluid RCM modeling results reveal that considerable error can be introduced into simulating RCM autoignition experiments when assuming ideal-gas behavior, leading to contradictory validation results of chemical kinetic models. Therefore, we recommend the community adopt frameworks with real-fluid behavior fully accounted for to analyze and simulate past and future RCM experiments, so as to avoid misinterpretation of RCM autoignition experiments and eliminate the errors that can be introduced into the simulation results with the existing RCM modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Twist and higher modes of a complex scalar field at the threshold of collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the threshold of collapse of a massless complex scalar field in axisymmetric spacetimes under the ansatz of Choptuik et al. 2004, in which a symmetry depending on the azimuthal parameter $m$ is imposed on the scalar field. This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend earlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code bamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon, and a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve near-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest nontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete self-similarity with echoing period $\Delta\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling with exponent $\gamma\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we find that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry class but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\Delta\simeq0.09$ and $\gamma\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical solution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular momentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation, $J_{\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum is minimal at the threshold, with $\chi_{\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\mathrm{AH}}^2\to0$, and, therefore, excludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results demonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the critical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor bifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families considered here.</description>
