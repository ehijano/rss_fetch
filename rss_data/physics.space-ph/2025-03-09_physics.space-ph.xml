      <title>Cosmic Rays and the Askaryan Effect Reveal Subsurface Structure and Buried Ice on the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first full-wavelength numerical simulations of the electric field generated by cosmic ray impacts into the Moon. Billions of cosmic rays fall onto the Moon every year. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray impacts produce secondary particle cascades within the regolith and subsequent coherent, widebandwidth, linearly-polarized radio pulses by the Askaryan Effect. Observations of the cosmic ray particle shower radio emissions can reveal subsurface structure on the Moon and enable the broad and deep prospecting necessary to confirm or refute the existence of polar ice deposits. Our simulations show that the radio emissions and reflections could reveal ice layers as thin as 10 cm and buried under regolith as deep as 9 m. The Askaryan Effect presents a novel and untapped opportunity for characterizing buried lunar ice at unprecedented depths and spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. Characterization of Dark UAPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high-tech observations of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) class objects to evaluate their characteristics. We present data in three cases. (1) Multi-side daytime observations of UAPs over Kiev. (2) Night observations of a group of objects in the vicinity of the Moon. (3) UAP observations in the combat zone in Ukraine. Dark UAPs in the visible wavelength range are observed only during the day. At night they can only be seen in the infrared wavelength range. We note large sizes of UAPs, from three to six kilometers.They exhibit large velocities, from 2.5 Mach and much larger. They have low albedo, from three percent and below, that is, they actually exhibit features of a completely black body.</description>

      <title>Design of a low-thrust gravity-assisted rendezvous trajectory to Halley's comet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comets are the most pristine planetesimals left from the formation of the Solar System. They carry unique information on the materials and the physical processes which led to the presence of planets and moons. Many important questions about cometary physics, such as origin, constituents and mechanism of cometary activity, remain unanswered. The next perihelion of comet 1P/Halley, in 2061, is an excellent opportunity to revisit this object of outstanding scientific and cultural relevance. In 1986, during its latest approach to the Sun, several flyby targeted Halley's comet to observe its nucleus and shed light on its properties, origin, and evolution. However, due to its retrograde orbit and high ecliptic inclination, the quality of data was limited by the large relative velocity and short time spent by the spacecraft inside the coma of the comet. A rendezvous mission like ESA/Rosetta would overcome such limitations, but the trajectory design is extremely challenging due to the shortcomings of current propulsion technology. Given the considerable lead times of spacecraft development and the long duration of the interplanetary transfer required to reach the comet, it is imperative to start mission planning several decades in advance. This study presents a low-thrust rendezvous strategy to reach the comet before the phase of intense activity during the close approach to the Sun. The trajectory design combines a gravity-assist maneuver with electric propulsion arcs to maximize scientific payload mass while constraining transfer duration. A propulsive plane change maneuver would be prohibitive. To keep the propellant budget within reasonable limits, most of the plane change maneuver is achieved via either a Jupiter or a Saturn flyby. The interplanetary low-thrust gravity-assisted trajectory design strategy is described, followed by the presentation of multiple proof-of-concept solutions.</description>
