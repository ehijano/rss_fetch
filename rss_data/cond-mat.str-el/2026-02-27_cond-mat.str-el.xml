      <title>Tuning the magnetic properties of Kitaev materials via the antiferromagnetic proximity effect: Novel phases and application to an $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/MnPS$_3$ bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the increasing level of control over van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has opened new routes to tune the properties of quantum materials. Motivated by these developments, we examine the potential consequences of interfacing a Kitaev honeycomb magnet, such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, with a nearly lattice-matched vdW antiferromagnet. By combining perturbation theory, exact diagonalization, and a classical energy-minimization method, we show that an effective staggered magnetic field originating from the vdW antiferromagnet can drive a monolayer of a Kitaev material into various novel phases, including an antichiral Kitaev spin liquid, a nonmagnetic nematic phase, and different types of skyrmion crystals. We then apply first-principle simulations to assess the prospect of concretely realizing this setup in a heterobilayer of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and the easy-axis antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$.</description>

      <title>Hidden $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ subspace symmetry protection for quantum scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the paradigmatic spin-1 XY chain under open boundary conditions, which hosts exact quantum many-body scars generated by an emergent Spectrum Generating Algebra (SGA). We show that the scar subspace possesses a symmetry-protected trivial (SPt) character that we attribute to a hidden $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry of another model, namely the commutant Hamiltonian, for which the scars are the ground states. We construct a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type twist operator, which, for scar states, takes the value $-1,$ and, for ergodic states, approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit. A complementary understanding of the stability of the scars under different perturbations is obtained by analyzing the Loschmidt echo and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the scars. Finite-size scaling analysis of the QFI reveals that the scars are much more sensitive to perturbations as compared to the nearby thermal states. Based on the analysis of QFI and different LSM twist operators, we obtain a classification of different SGA-preserving and SGA-breaking perturbations.</description>

      <title>Kondo Reshapes Multiple Orders in a $5f$ van der Waals Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron interactions can drive magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $\beta$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $\beta$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $\beta$-UTe$_3$. Our expansion of the Kondo phase diagram beyond spin-mediated competition opens new possibilities for proximity-induced phase engineering in correlated van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometry-driven Mott transitions and magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the single-particle Bloch wavefunction changes in phase and amplitude across the Brillouin Zone. In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced agreement of Kohn--Sham and many-body Berry phases in the SSH--Hubbard chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $\theta$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(\theta,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $\theta$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $\theta$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $\theta$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.</description>

      <title>Memory-Dominated Quantum Criticality as a Universal Route to High-Temperature Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical origin of high--temperature superconductivity remains a central challenge of strongly correlated quantum matter. Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the metal-insulator crossover in the square-lattice Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction-driven evolution from a Fermi liquid to a Mott insulator is a hallmark of strongly correlated fermion systems. In this work, we present a {\it numerically unbiased} study of such metal-to-insulator crossover in the half-filled square-lattice Hubbard model at finite temperatures, employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. By jointly analyzing thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish the crossover diagram of the model in the temperature-interaction ($T$-$U$) plane. With increasing $U$, our numerical results reveal an extended crossover regime, which we refer to as the {\it Bad Metal}, that separates the Fermi liquid and Mott insulator. During the crossover, we also examine the antiferromagnetic spin correlations and observe pronounced nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral functions. Furthermore, we investigate the temperature dependence of several commonly used observables in the model. As representative results, we achieve an accurate map of the thermal entropy across the crossover diagram, and identify the parameter regions in which the model exhibits the Pomeranchuk cooling, characterized by an adiabatic cooling with increasing $U$. Beyond offering a more refined understanding of the crossover phenomenon, our work also provides valuable benchmark and guideline for future optical lattice experiments on the square-lattice Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Phonons reflect dynamic spin-state order in LaCoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate lattice dynamics in LaCoO$_3$ using inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering over $T = 2\mbox{-}650\,\mathrm{K}$, spanning the spin-state crossover at $T_{1} \approx 100\,\mathrm{K}$ and the insulator--metal transition at $T_{2} \approx 550\,\mathrm{K}$. Comparison with quasi-harmonic $ab-initio$ lattice-dynamical calculations helps reveal anomalous softening of a $\approx 10\,\mathrm{meV}$ oxygen phonon, confined to the temperature interval $T_{1} \leq T \leq T_{2}$ and localized in momentum space at $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{SSO}} = \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right)_{c}$. This wave vector corresponds to the spin-state ordering originally proposed by Goodenough [J. Phys. Chem. Solids 6, 287-297 (1958)]. Our results therefore provide momentum-resolved evidence for dynamic correlations of high-spin and low-spin Co$^{3+}$ states in LaCoO$_{3}$, linking spin-state fluctuations to anomalous phonon renormalization.</description>

      <title>Quantum magnetic phase transitions in a Kugel-Khomskii model including spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the formalism of pseudospin and isospin operators the Hamiltonian of an effective Kugel-Khomskii model with spin-orbit coupling is derived with an exact account of the $t_{2g}$ multiplet splitting by the crystal field. An analytical solution is obtained for an arbitrary relation between the Hubbard repulsion and crystal field splitting, i.e., interpolating the cases of Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer insulators. A description of orbital orders is given in terms of octupole moments. The ground-state phase diagram is constructed in the parameter space spanned by spin-orbit coupling, Hund's exchange, and Hubbard interaction. We investigate a quantum phase transition between a state exhibiting hidden magnetic and orbital long-range order and a ferromagnetic state with a reduced magnetic moment accompanied by antiferroorbital order. It is shown that the cooperative effect of Hund's and spin-orbit interactions gives rise to an easy-plane-type anisotropy.</description>

      <title>$Z_3$ confined and deconfined Coulomb liquids in $S_{\rm eff} = 3/2$ pyrochlore magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an interesting regime in the physics of pyrochlore magnets in which spin-orbit and crystal field effects lead to {\em two} low-lying magnetic doublets that can be modeled as an effective spin $S=3/2$ degree of freedom that sees a dominant easy-axis antiferromagnetic exchange $J&gt;0$ favoring the local $[111]$ axes, which competes with a comparably strong single-ion anisotropy $\Delta = J+\mu/2$ (with $|\mu| \ll J$) favoring the perpendicular planes. For a precise analysis, we study the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit in which $w \equiv \exp(-\mu/T)$ is the control variable. In this limit, we find {\em two topologically distinct} zero-field Coulomb phases separated by a first-order $Z_3$ confinement transition at $w_c \approx 2.02$. Both Coulomb phases admit a description in terms of the fluctuations of a coarse-grained divergence-free polarization field. However, the flux of this polarization field is restricted to integer multiples of $3$, and only charges that are multiples of 3 are deconfined in one of these phases, while all integer fluxes are allowed and all integer charges are deconfined in the other phase. Experimental systems with small negative $\mu$ ({\em i.e.}, $-J \ll \mu &lt; 0$) are therefore predicted to exhibit signatures of this topological transition when cooled below $T_c \approx 1.42|\mu|$.</description>

      <title>Extended Ashkin-Teller transition in two coupled frustrated Haldane chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an extremely rich ground state phase diagram of two spin-1 Haldane chains frustrated with a three-site exchange and coupled by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction on a zig-zag ladder. A particular feature of the phase diagram is the extended quantum phase transition in the Ashkin-Teller universality class that separates the plaquette phase, which spontaneously breaks translation symmetry, and the uniform disordered phase. The former is connected to the Haldane phase, stabilized by large inter-chain coupling, via the topological Gaussian transition. Upon decreasing the inter-chain interactions, this intermediate disorder phase vanishes, giving place to a dimerized phase separated from the plaquette phase on one side via a non-magnetic Ising transition and from the Haldane phase on the other side by a topological weak first-order transition. Finally, in the limit of two decoupled chains, we recover a quantum critical point that corresponds to two copies of the Wess-Zumino-Witten $\mathrm{SU(2)}_2$ criticality with a total central charge $c=3$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order and excitations in Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ and Ce$_3$ZrBi$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R3MBi5 rare-earth intermetallics (R = rare earth, M = Ti, Zr, Sc) provide a versatile platform to explore how Kondo hybridization, RKKY exchange, magnetic frustration, and broken inversion symmetry may cooperate to generate unusual magnetic behavior. We present a comprehensive neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic structure, crystal electric field (CEF), and low-energy excitations in the locally noncentrosymmetric Kondo-lattice compounds Ce3TiBi5 and Ce3ZrBi5. Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic order in Ce3TiBi5 with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.388) and a reduced ordered moment of m = 0.53(3)$\mu_{B}$. Ce3ZrBi5 exhibits a qualitatively similar magnetic diffraction profile, with k $\simeq$ (0, 0, 0.37). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolve two clear, well-separated CEF excitations in both compounds with nearly the same profile, confirming a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state. At low energies, a broad, quasi-elastic magnetic response is observed at T $\simeq$ TN, whose momentum-dependence is inconsistent with that expected from conventional collective excitations of localized moments. This discrepancy, along with a Kondo temperature estimate TK ~ 3--5 K -- comparable to TN -- indicates sizable Kondo hybridization, which accounts for the moment reduction and the spiral magnetic order that appears to involve the magnetic hard direction. Our results place these compounds in a regime where local inversion symmetry breaking, anisotropic CEF effects, and competing Kondo and RKKY interactions collectively give rise to unconventional magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Arrested Relaxation in a Disorder-Free Coulomb Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Coulomb spin liquids in classical spin-3/2 ice and show that the enlarged on-site Hilbert space gives rise to a qualitatively new class of such phases. Beyond the conventional magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare example of dynamical arrest in a short-range interacting, disorder-free system. We demonstrate that the arrested dynamics originate from novel composite excitation structures unique to spin-3/2 ice and from kinetically constrained relaxation pathways that require activated processes. Our results establish higher-spin ice as a fertile platform for realising unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and dynamical arrest without quenched disorder.</description>

      <title>Phononic enhancement and detection of hidden spin-nematicity and dynamics in quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin nematic phase, characterized by long-range order of spin quadrupole moments in the absence of dipolar magnetism, presents a significant challenge for conventional experimental detection. We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering. Our formalism offers a direct and powerful method to uncover the hidden spin nematicity, opening a new pathway for diagnosing multipolar orders in quantum magnets.</description>

Abstract: Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) operations such as matrix product operator contractions are prohibitively expensive for large bond dimensions. We propose an adaptive patching scheme that exploits block-sparse QTT structures to reduce costs through divide-and-conquer, adaptively partitioning tensors into smaller patches with reduced bond dimensions. We demonstrate substantial improvements for sharply localized functions and show efficient computation of bubble diagrams and Bethe-Salpeter equations, opening the door to practical large-scale QTT-based computations previously beyond reach.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity by disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale disorder is conventionally regarded as detrimental to superconductivity; however, under specific conditions, it can enhance superconducting properties. Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$.
  Both $T_c^\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state.
  To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of chiral $p$-wave and $d$-wave states in $g$-wave altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets emerge as a novel platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity through their exotic momentum-dependent spin-splitting of electronic band structures. Recent experiments have uncovered a novel form of altermagnetism with distinctive $g$-wave symmetry in CrSb. However, the potential for unconventional superconductivity arising from $g$-wave altermagnetism in such systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries. These findings underscore the potential of $g$-wave altermagnets to host sought-after chiral and gapless superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Interaction and disorder effects on Cooper instability in two-dimensional fractional Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing a renormalization group analysis that allows for an unbiased treatment of competing physical ingredients, we systematically trace how the interplay between Cooper pairing and disorder scatterings governs the emergence or suppression of Cooper instability in the low-energy regime of fractional Dirac semimetals.In the clean limit, we find that the emergence of Cooper instability requires surpassing a finite interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$, and depends sensitively on both the fractional exponent $\alpha$ and the transfer momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(Q,\phi)$. Specifically, bigger values of $\alpha$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $\alpha\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,\phi)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed. In the presence of disorders, we demonstrate that they can either promote or suppress Cooper instability. Disorder of type $\Delta_1$ or $\Delta_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|\lambda_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$), the suppressive influence of $\Delta_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $\Delta_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interference phenomena in superconductors, such as Josephson interference and Little-Parks oscillations, serve as powerful probes of phase coherence, symmetry breaking and vortex dynamics. However, they are typically observed in well-defined mesoscopic structures, and their behavior in the two-dimensional limit remains largely unexplored. Here, we report periodic magnetoresistance oscillations, superconducting interference patterns, and interfering diode effect in unpatterned few-layer NbSe2. These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops. Our results reveal that the observed interference phenomena originate from the lost of global phase coherence, providing a new route to accessing interference effects in unpatterned superconductors.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation via Multicriticality in a 3D Lattice Gross-Neveu Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional lattice model of two flavors of massless staggered fermions coupled through two independent four-fermion interactions, $U_I$ and $U_B$. Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present an analytical framework for studying antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating states in the Hubbard model. We first derive an analytical solution for the single-particle Green's functions in the atomic limit. Within a second-order perturbation approach, we compute the ground state energy and show that the ground state is antiferromagnetically ordered. Then we derive an analytical solution for single-particle Green's functions when effects of the hopping term are considered in the N\'{e}el state. With the analytical solution, we compute the spectral functions and explain various properties of the AFM Mott insulating state as observed both experimentally and numerically: i) magnetic blueshift of the Mott gap; ii) the low energy part in the parental compounds of cuprate high \(T_c\) superconductors, which corresponds to a single band Hubbard model description. This work comprehends the electronic properties of antiferromagnetic Mott states analytically and provides a foundation for future investigations of doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, aiming for the mechanism of cuprates high-\(T_c\) superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Interaction robustness of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and Luttinger liquids from a mixed anomaly approach</title>

Abstract: The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets. However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$ whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems, this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transient spectral function during the photoinduced melting of charge order in a correlated electron system, to unravel the dynamical processes triggered by different initial excitations. We employ a one-dimensional interacting spinless fermion model introducing a pulsed laser light, and perform a comparative study by the Hartree-Fock approximation and by the exact diagonalization method to numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We find characteristic behavior in the transient spectral function, whose features strongly depend on the pump light frequency $\omega_p$. When $\omega_p$ is resonant with the collective phase mode of frequency $\Omega_c\simeq \Delta_{\rm CO}/2$, where $\Delta_{\rm CO}$ is the charge gap, the transient spectral function exhibits a photoinduced in-gap weight which triggers large responses. With increasing the laser intensity, the development of in-gap weight directly turns into the collapse of the gap. This charge-order destabilization process is in sharp contrast to the case of $\omega_p&gt;\Delta_{\rm CO}$, where the photoirradiation induces interband electron-hole excitations giving rise to a shrinkage of the gap. The impact of quantum fluctuations and spatial inhomogeneity on the photoinduced dynamics is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of fully spin-compensated magnetic materials that nevertheless have spin-split electronic bands, offering novel perspectives for spintronics applications. Based on a rigorous analysis of altermagnetic many-body models and their symmetry we establish the important role of two fundamental types of polarizations in altermagnetic insulators: the charge and the spinetic one, where the latter corresponds to a macroscopic spin-displacement field. First principles calculations confirm and quantify their presence in real materials. The two polarizations are directly coupled and emerge in orthogonal directions when inversion symmetry is broken, either by the system developing a spontaneously ferroelectric polarization (in ferroelectric altermagnets), or by a charge displacement induced by an external electric field (for inversion invariant altermagnetic insulators). This presence of large and switchable spin accumulations constitute an attractive fundamental feature of altermagnetic insulators.</description>

Abstract: Fabricating room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this Letter, we report on the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films created through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling. This enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new ferromagnetic insulating phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the ferromagnetic insulating phase can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our Letter reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $\nu$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $\nu$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Crystallography-driven molecularization of a two-dimensional spin-$3/2$ magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-spin two-dimensional magnets are generally expected to develop conventional long-range order once the dominant exchange scale becomes appreciable. The layered spin-$3/2$ maple-leaf compound Na$_2$Mn$_3$O$_7$ defies this expectation: despite sizable antiferromagnetic interactions and no evident disorder, it exhibits no magnetic ordering and displays two well-separated thermodynamic crossover scales. We show that this behavior originates from a crystallography-driven molecularization of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The low-symmetry structure partitions the Mn sublattice into inequivalent exchange pathways, generating a pronounced hierarchy that nearly isolates antiferromagnetic hexagons. Magnetic correlations therefore develop in two stages: first within individual hexagons at a scale set by the dominant exchange, and only at much lower temperatures do frustrated inter-hexagon couplings attempt to establish coherence across the lattice. While isolated hexagons reproduce the two-step thermodynamic structure, the experimentally relevant temperature scales emerge only once the hexagons are embedded in the frustrated two-dimensional network. The resulting quantum ground state is magnetically disordered, characterized by strong intra-hexagon correlations and rapidly decaying inter-hexagon correlations. These results identify crystallographic inequivalence as a materials-level mechanism for stabilizing molecularized and quantum-disordered states even in large-spin two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Free and Interacting Fermionic Conformal Field Theories on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>

Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free-Majorana-fermion CFT on a set-up with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch and allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we observe two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm the emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum and the two-point correlation function of the local Majorana fermion. We further establish a correspondence between the fuzzy-sphere models and the field-theory Lagrangians, and extend it to an interacting fermionic CFT -- the super-Ising theory with emergent super-conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity in Rule-Based Constrained Many-Body Models: Scars, Fragmentation, and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic constraints in quantum many-body systems strongly restrict the accessible Hilbert space, giving rise to highly nontrivial dynamical behavior. In recent years, such systems have attracted growing interest as they provide insight into mechanisms of thermalization and into regimes where thermalization fails. In this work, we study a family of rule-based kinetically constrained models, including the celebrated Quantum Game of Life, from the perspective of quantum complexity, with a focus on entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and quantum chaos. Using spectral diagnostics such as level statistics and spectral form factors, we show that these models exhibit robust chaotic behavior while simultaneously supporting both strong and weak Hilbert-space fragmentation and quantum many-body scar states. To further elucidate the structure of these fragmented subspaces, we characterize them through their ability to generate quantum resources. In particular, we show that resource-generation capacity does not necessarily correlate with the dimensionality of a fragmented sector, and that entanglement structure and the ability to generate nonstabilizerness provide effective diagnostics for distinguishing dynamically disconnected sectors. Our work therefore explores kinetically constrained models in a general framework that is not restricted to Rydberg blockade-based constraints alone.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates: itinerant perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates from an itinerant perspective. Starting from a tight binding fit to recent ARPES measurements on compressively strained thin films, we incorporate the standard set of onsite repulsive interactions among partially filled $e_g$ orbitals: intra-orbital $U$, inter-orbital $U'$, Hund's coupling $J_H$ and a pair hopping $J_P$. We obtain the effective pairing interaction by dressing these bare interactions with particle-hole fluctuations via the RPA. In the strong Hund's coupling regime, we find that $s$-wave superconductivity and $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ SDW order are the favored ground states. With weaker Hund's coupling, we find that $d$-wave pairing and $(\pi, \pi)$ SDW are the leading ground states. Our results are qualitatively consistent with earlier DMRG studies, and point to the key role played by Hund's coupling in determining the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in this system.</description>
