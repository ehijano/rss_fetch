      <title>Simpler and More General Distributed Coloring Based on Simple List Defective Coloring Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give list coloring variants of simple iterative defective coloring algorithms. Formally, in a list defective coloring instance, each node $v$ of a graph is given a list $L_v$ of colors and a list of allowed defects $d_v(x)$ for the colors. Each node $v$ needs to be colored with a color $x\in L_v$ such that at most $d_v(x)$ neighbors of $v$ also pick the same color $x$. For a defect parameter $d$, it is known that by making two sweeps in opposite order over the nodes of an edge-oriented graph with maximum outdegree $\beta$, one can compute a coloring with $O(\beta^2/d^2)$ colors such that every node has at most $d$ outneighbors of the same color. We generalize this and show that if all nodes have lists of size $p^2$ and $\forall v:\sum_{x\in L_v}(d_v(x)+1)&gt;p\cdot\beta$, we can make two sweeps of the nodes such that at the end, each node $v$ has chosen a color $x\in L_v$ for which at most $d_v(x)$ outneighbors of $v$ are colored with color $x$. Our algorithm is simpler and computationally significantly more efficient than existing algorithms for similar list defective coloring problems. We show that the above result can in particular be used to obtain an alternative $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\Delta})+O(\log^* n)$-round algorithm for the $(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem in the CONGEST model. The neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. It is known that by doing a single sweep over the nodes of a graph of neighborhood independence $\theta$, one can compute a $d$-defective coloring with $O(\theta\cdot \Delta/d)$ colors. We extend this approach to the list defective coloring setting and use it to obtain an efficient recursive coloring algorithm for graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$. In particular, if $\theta=O(1)$, we get an $(\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$-round algorithm.</description>

      <title>On linear-combinatorial problems associated with subspaces spanned by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete answer to the question about subspaces generated by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors, which arose in the work of I.Kanter and H.Sompolinsky on associative memories, is given. More precisely, let vectors $v_1, \ldots , v_p,$ $p\leq n-1,$ be chosen at random uniformly and independently from $\{\pm 1\}^n \subset {\bf R}^n.$ Then the probability ${\mathbb P}(p, n)$ that $$span \ \langle v_1, \ldots , v_p \rangle \cap \left\{ \{\pm 1\}^n \setminus \{\pm v_1, \ldots , \pm v_p\}\right\} \ne \emptyset \ $$ is shown to be $$4{p \choose 3}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n + O\left(\left(\frac{5}{8} + o_n(1)\right)^n\right) \quad \mbox{as} \quad n\to \infty,$$ where the constant implied by the $O$-notation does not depend on $p$. The main term in this estimate is the probability that some 3 vectors $v_{j_1}, v_{j_2}, v_{j_3}$ of $v_j$, $j= 1, \ldots , p,$ have a linear combination that is a $\{\pm 1\}$-vector different from $\pm v_{j_1}, \pm v_{j_2}, \pm v_{j_3}. $</description>

      <title>Trail Trap: a variant of Partizan Edge Geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-player game played on undirected graphs called Trail Trap, which is a variant of a game known as Partizan Edge Geography. One player starts by choosing any edge and moving a token from one endpoint to the other; the other player then chooses a different edge and does the same. Alternating turns, each player moves their token along an unused edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex, until one player cannot move and loses. We present an algorithm to determine which player has a winning strategy when the graph is a tree, and partially characterize the trees on which a given player wins. Additionally, we show that Trail Trap is NP-hard, even for connected bipartite planar graphs with maximum degree $4$ as well as for disconnected graphs. We determine which player has a winning strategy for certain subclasses of complete bipartite graphs and grid graphs, and we propose several open problems for further study.</description>

      <title>Guided Combinatorial Algorithms for Submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For constrained, not necessarily monotone submodular maximization, guiding the measured continuous greedy algorithm with a local search algorithm currently obtains the state-of-the-art approximation factor of 0.401 \citep{buchbinder2023constrained}. These algorithms rely upon the multilinear extension and the Lovasz extension of a submodular set function. However, the state-of-the-art approximation factor of combinatorial algorithms has remained $1/e \approx 0.367$ \citep{buchbinder2014submodular}. In this work, we develop combinatorial analogues of the guided measured continuous greedy algorithm and obtain approximation ratio of $0.385$ in $\oh{ kn }$ queries to the submodular set function for size constraint, and $0.305$ for a general matroid constraint. Further, we derandomize these algorithms, maintaining the same ratio and asymptotic time complexity. Finally, we develop a deterministic, nearly linear time algorithm with ratio $0.377$.</description>

      <title>Isolated Suborders and their Application to Counting Closure Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13081v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the interplay between isolated suborders and closures. Isolated suborders are a special kind of suborders and can be used to diminish the number of elements of an ordered set by means of a quotient construction. The decisive point is that there are simple formulae establishing relationships between the number of closures in the original ordered set and the quotient thereof induced by isolated suborders. We show how these connections can be used to derive a recursive algorithm for counting closures, provided the ordered set under consideration contains suitable isolated suborders.</description>

      <title>On RAC Drawings of Graphs with Two Bends per Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that every $n$-vertex graph that admits a 2-bend RAC drawing in the plane, where the edges are polylines with two bends per edge and any pair of edges can only cross at a right angle, has at most $20n-24$ edges for $n\geq 3$. This improves upon the previous upper bound of $74.2n$; this is the first improvement in more than 12 years. A crucial ingredient of the proof is an upper bound on the size of plane multigraphs with polyline edges in which the first and last segments are either parallel or orthogonal.</description>

      <title>Cliquewidth and dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every poset with bounded cliquewidth and with sufficiently large dimension contains the standard example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. This applies in particular to posets whose cover graphs have bounded treewidth, as the cliquewidth of a poset is bounded in terms of the treewidth of the cover graph. For the latter posets, we prove a stronger statement: every such poset with sufficiently large dimension contains the Kelly example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. Using this result, we obtain a full characterization of the minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{C}$ such that posets with cover graphs in $\mathcal{C}$ have bounded dimension: they are exactly the classes excluding the cover graph of some Kelly example. Finally, we consider a variant of poset dimension called Boolean dimension, and we prove that posets with bounded cliquewidth have bounded Boolean dimension.
  The proofs rely on Colcombet's deterministic version of Simon's factorization theorem, which is a fundamental tool in formal language and automata theory, and which we believe deserves a wider recognition in structural and algorithmic graph theory.</description>

Abstract: We revisit and generalize inequalities for the summatory function of the sum of digits in a given integer base. We prove that several known results can be deduced from a theorem in a 2023 paper by Mohanty, Greenbury, Sarkany, Narayanan, Dingle, Ahnert, and Louis, whose primary scope is the maximum mutational robustness in genotype-phenotype maps.</description>

      <title>Diameter of the inversion graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an oriented graph $\vec{G}$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both endvertices in $X$. The inversion graph of a labelled graph $G$, denoted by ${\mathcal{I}}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the labelled orientations of $G$ in which two labelled orientations $\vec{G}_1$ and $\vec{G}_2$ of $G$ are adjacent if and only if there is an inversion $X$ transforming $\vec{G}_1$ into $\vec{G}_2$. In this paper, we study the inversion diameter of a graph which is the diameter of its inversion graph denoted by $diam(\mathcal{I}(G))$. We show that the inversion diameter is tied to the star chromatic number, the acyclic chromatic number and the oriented chromatic number. Thus a graph class has bounded inversion diameter if and only if it also has bounded star chromatic number, acyclic chromatic number and oriented chromatic number. We give some upper bounds on the inversion diameter of a graph $G$ contained in one of the following graph classes: planar graphs ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 12$), planar graphs of girth 8 ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 3$), graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2\Delta -1$), graphs with treewidth at mots $t$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2t$).
  We also show that determining the inversion diameter of a given graph is NP-hard.</description>
