      <title>Percolation connectivity in deposits obtained using competitive random sequential adsorption of binary disk mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectedness percolation phenomena in the two-dimensional (2D) packing of binary mixtures of disks with different diameters were studied numerically. The packings were produced using random sequential adsorption (RSA) model with simultaneous deposition of disks. The ratio of the particle diameters was varied within the range $D=1$-$10$, and the selection probability of the small disks was varied within the range 0-1. A core-shell structure of the particles was assumed for the analysis of connectivity. The packing coverages in a jamming state for different components, connectivities through small, large and both types of disks, the behavior of electrical conductivity were analyzed. The observed complex effects were explained accounting for the formation of conductive "bridges" from small disks in pores between large disks.</description>

      <title>Effects of charge and size on the coadsorption of counterionic colloids in Gibbs monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses a coarse-grained Monte Carlo algorithm to model and simulate the coadsorption of a binary mixture of counterionic colloids in Gibbs monolayers. These monolayers form at a idealized air-water interface, with one non-soluble species confined at the interface and the second one partially soluble in the aqueous phase. The investigation focuses on the effect of colloidal size and charge on the thermodynamics and microstructure of the monolayer. We find that the composition of the monolayer evolves non-trivially with surface coverage, depending on the balance of steric and electrostatic forces. When the electrostatic interactions are weak, the soluble species is expelled from the monolayer upon compression, yielding a phase behaviour particularly sensitive to the relative size of the soluble and non-soluble colloids. By contrast, strong electrostatic interactions favour the stabilization of the soluble particles in the monolayer and the formation of quasi-equimolar fluids, with only a weak dependence on particle size. The combination of these phenomena results in the formation of a number of two-dimensional mesoscopic arrangements in the monolayer, ranging from diluted gas-phase behaviour to domains of aggregates and percolates, and to incipient crystalline structures.</description>

      <title>Shape changes of a single hairy particle with mobile ligands at a liquid-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate rearrangements of a single hairy particle at a liquid-liquid interface using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We consider the particles with the same (symmetrical interactions) and different (asymmetrical interactions) affinity to the liquids. We show how ligand mobility affects the behavior of the hairy particle at the liquid-liquid interface. We found that such a hairy particle can take various shapes at the interface. For example, a Janus-like snowman consisting of a segment cluster and a bare part of the core, Saturn-like structures, and the core with a wide ``plume'' on one side. A configuration of the particle at the interface is characterized by the vertical displacement distance and the orientation of the particle relative to the phase boundary. The selected descriptors are used to characterize the shape of the segment cloud. We found that the shape of a particle and its localization at the interface can be determined by tuning the interactions with the liquids.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the wetting behavior of solid surfaces by water-like models within a density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the analysis of predictions of a classical density functional theory for associating fluids with different association strength concerned with wetting of solid surfaces. The four associating sites water-like models with non-associative square-well attraction parametrized by Clark et al. [Mol. Phys., 2006, 104, 3561] are considered. The fluid-solid potential is assumed to have a 10-4-3 functional form. The growth of water film on the substrate upon changing the chemical potential is described. The wetting and prewetting critical temperatures, as well as the prewetting phase diagram are evaluated for different fluid-solid attraction strength from the analysis of the adsorption isotherms. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the contact angle is obtained from the Young equation. It yields estimates for the wetting temperature as well. Theoretical findings are compared with experimental results and in a few cases with data from computer simulations. The theory is successful and quite accurate in describing the wetting temperature and contact angle changes with temperature for different values of fluid-substrate attraction. Moreover, the method provides an easy tool to study other associating fluids on solids of importance for chemical engineering, in comparison with laboratory experiments and computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Active microrheology of fluids with orientational order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven spherical colloidal particle moving in a fluid with a broken rotational symmetry. Using a nematic liquid crystal as a model, we demonstrate that when the applied force is not aligned along or perpendicular to the orientational order, the colloidal velocity does not align with the force, but forms an angle with respect to the pulling direction. This leads to blue an anisotropic hydrodynamic drag tensor which depends on the material parameters. In the case of nematic liquid crystal, we give an analytical expression and discuss the resulting implications for active microrheology experiments on fluids with broken rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Toward a realistic model of multilayered bacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria are prolific at colonizing diverse surfaces under a widerange of environmental conditions, and exhibit fascinating examples of self-organization across scales. Though it has recently attracted considerable interest, the role of mechanical forces in the collective behavior of bacterial colonies is not yet fully understood. Here, we construct a model of growing rod-like bacteria, such as Escherichia coli based purely on mechanical forces. We perform overdamped molecular dynamics simulations of the colony starting from a few cells in contact with a surface. As the colony grows, microdomains of strongly aligned cells grow and proliferate. Our model captures both the initial growth of a bacterial colony and also shows characteristic signs of capturing the experimentally observed transition to multilayered colonies over longer timescales. We compare our results with experiments on E. coli cells and analyze the statistics of microdomains.</description>

      <title>Description of CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ ferrielectrics in a mixed Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of spontaneous polarization in CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ ferrielectrics is related to the second order Jahn-Teller effect for copper cations located in a double-well local potential, the stereoactivity of indium cations located in a three-well local potential, as well as the valence fluctuations of phosphorus cations. The paraelectric to ferrielectric phase transition is primarily determined by the coupling of indium cations with their surroundings. This transition can be analyzed using the mixed Ising model with spins $s = 1/2$ and $S = 1$. The spectrum of pseudospin fluctuations at different temperatures was calculated using a mean-field approach for a set of quantum anharmonic oscillators. The results were then compared with Raman spectroscopy data for CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ crystal. The analysis indicates that the lattice anharmonicity below 150 K, is mainly determined by the indium sublattice, leading to the coexistence of the glassy state and ferrielectric phase. Above 150 K, the anharmonicity of the copper sublattice activates the ionic conductivity and results in the existence of a long-ranged fluctuated cluster of spontaneous polarization in a temperature interval of the paraelectric phase above $T_{{C}}$.</description>

      <title>A numerical framework for phoretic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical a framework to study phoretic particle dynamics in two dimensions. The particles are modeled as chemically active rigid circles, which can emit or absorb a solute into surrounding fluid. The interaction between particles and solute induces a slip flow on particle surfaces, and the solute is advected by the fluid flow and diffuses with a constant diffusivity. The fluid-structure interaction is resolved by a boundary integral method accelerated by Ewald-like decomposition. The sharp resolution of moving boundaries for solute kinetics is performed thanks to an overlapping mesh method. The framework is validated separately for the Stokes problem and the advection--diffusion problem, reaching relatively high order of accuracy. Moreover, we employ the framework to more general problems, including particles in nearly infinite domain and straight channels, and multiparticle motions.</description>

      <title>Rheo-SINDy: Finding a Constitutive Model from Rheological Data for Complex Fluids Using Sparse Identification for Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rheology plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting material behavior by discovering governing equations that relate deformation and stress, known as constitutive equations. Despite the critical importance of constitutive equations in predicting dynamics of complex fluids, a systematic methodology for deriving these equations from available data has remained a significant challenge in the field. To overcome the problem, we propose a novel method named Rheo-SINDy, which employs the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for discovering constitutive models from rheological data. Rheo-SINDy was applied to five distinct scenarios, including four cases with well-established constitutive equations and one without predefined equations. Our results demonstrate that Rheo-SINDy successfully identifies accurate models for the known constitutive equations and derives physically plausible approximate models for the scenario with the unknown one. These findings validate the robustness of Rheo-SINDy in handling real-world data complexities and underscore its efficacy as a powerful tool for advancing the development of data-driven approaches in rheology.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Free-Energy Functionals with Pair-Correlation Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic Helmholtz free-energy functional, the centerpiece of classical density functional theory (cDFT), is at best only known approximately for 3D systems, which hampers the use of cDFT as a powerful tool for describing the intricate thermodynamic equilibrium properties and structural aspects of classical many-body systems. Here we introduce a method for learning a quasi-exact neural-network approximation of this functional by exclusively training on a dataset of radial distribution functions. This method based on pair-correlation matching circumvents the need to sample costly heterogeneous density profiles in a wide variety of external potentials and hence offers a pathway to significantly ease the computational demands for future approaches to extend machine learning for cDFT to arbitrary three-dimensional systems. For a supercritical 3D Lennard-Jones system we demonstrate that the learned neural free-energy functional accurately predicts planar inhomogeneous density profiles under various complex external potentials obtained from simulations, while simultaneously offering precise thermodynamic predictions far outside the training regime.</description>

      <title>Growth of membranes formed by associating polymers at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer association at liquid-liquid interfaces is a promising way to spontaneously obtain soft self-healing membranes. In the case of reversible bonding between two polymers, the macromolecules are mobile everywhere within the membrane and they can be absorbed into it at both boundaries due to binding to macromolecules of the other type. In this work, we develop the theoretical model of membrane growth based on these assumptions. The asymptotic dependence of membrane thickness on time as h ~ t^(1/2), as typically observed in experiments in a stationary regime, reveals an interdiffusion-controlled process, where the polymer fluxes sustain the polymer absorption at the membrane boundaries. The membrane growth rate is mainly determined by the difference in equilibrium compositions at the boundaries, the association constant, the polymer lengths and mobilities. This model is further used to describe the growth of hydrogel membranes formed via H-bonding of polymers at the interface between a solution of poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) in isopropyl myristate and an aqueous solution of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA). The film thickness is measured by reflectometric methods. The dependence of thickness on time can be approximated by the power law t^(beta), where beta= 1/2 for the PMAA solution at pH=3 and decreases with increasing pH and, hence, ionization degree. The growth rate slows down about 25 times for 500-nm-thick films at pH = 5.1 compared to the case of pH = 3. The ionization degree of PMAA solutions was studied by potentiometric methods. Even a small change in ionization was found to influence the growth rate of the film. A slowdown of the film growth for the ionized polymer can be explained by a drop in the composition gradient in the membrane, as is predicted by the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Crystals and Quasicrystals in a Non-Additive Binary Mixture of Hard Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new materials typically involves a process of trial and error, guided by insights from past experimental and theoretical findings. The inverse design approach for soft-matter systems has the potential to optimize specific physical parameters such as particle interactions, particle shape, or composition and packing fraction. This optimization aims to facilitate the spontaneous formation of specific target structures through self-assembly. In this study, we expand upon a recently introduced inverse design protocol for monodisperse systems to identify the required conditions and interactions for assembling crystal and quasicrystal phases within a binary mixture of two distinct species. This method utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to identify the optimal state point and interaction parameters, enabling the self-assembly of the desired structure. Additionally, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies different phases based on their diffraction patterns, serving as a fitness function for the desired structure. Using our protocol, we successfully inverse design two-dimensional crystalline structures, including a hexagonal lattice, and a dodecagonal quasicrystal, within a non-additive binary mixture of hard disks. Finally, we introduce a symmetry-based order parameter that leverages the encoded symmetry within the diffraction pattern. This order parameter circumvents the need for training a CNN, and is used as a fitness function to inverse design an octagonal quasicrystal.</description>

      <title>Torsional parallel plate flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluids with wall slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of wall slip on the apparent flow curves of viscoplastic materials obtained using torsional parallel plate rheometers is analysed by considering Herschel-Bulkley fluids and assuming that slip occurs above a critical wall shear stress, the slip yield stress {\tau}_c, taken to be lower than the yield stress, {\tau}_0. Thus, different flow regimes are encountered as the angular velocity of the experiment is increased. When the rim shear stress {\tau}_R is below the slip yield stress, the exerted torque is not sufficient to rotate the disk and the material remains still. When {\tau}_c&lt;{\tau}_R&lt;{\tau}_0 the material is still unyielded but exhibits wall slip and rotates as a solid at half the angular velocity of the rotating disk. Finally, when {\tau}_R&gt;{\tau}_0, the material exhibits slip everywhere and yields only in the annulus r_0&lt;r&lt;R, where r_0 is the critical radius at which the shear stress is equal to the yield stress and R is the radius of the disks. In the general case, the slip velocity, which varies with the radial distance, can be calculated numerically and then all quantities of interest, such as the true shear rate, and the two branches of the apparent flow curve can be computed by means of closed form expressions. Analytical solutions have also been obtained for certain values of the power-law exponent. In order to illustrate the effect of wall slip on the apparent flow curve and on the torque, results have been obtained for different gap sizes between the disks choosing the values of the rheological and slip parameters to be similar to reported values for certain colloidal suspensions. The computed apparent flow curves reproduce the patterns observed in the experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many materials exhibit a complex, hysteretic response to external driving, there has been a surge of interest in how the complex dynamics of internal materials states can be understood and designed to process and store information. We consider a system of connected rubber balloons that can be described by a Preisach model of non-interacting hysterons under pressure control, but for which the hysterons become coupled under volume control. We study this system by exploring the possible transition graphs, as well as by introducing a configuration space approach which tracks the volumes of each balloon. Changes in the transition graphs turn out to be related to changes in the topology of the configuration space of the balloons, providing a particularly geometric view of how transition graphs can be designed, as well as additional information on the existence of hidden metastable states. This class of systems is more general than just balloons.</description>

      <title>Active Nematic Ratchet in Asymmetric Obstacle Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of a periodic array of asymmetric obstacles in a two-dimensional active nematic. We find that activity in conjunction with the asymmetry leads to a ratchet effect or unidirectional flow of the fluid along the asymmetry direction. The directional flow is still present even in the active turbulent phase when the gap between obstacles is sufficiently small. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the topological defects transition from flow-mirroring to smectic-like as the gap between obstacles is made smaller, and explain this transition in terms of the pinning of negative winding number defects between obstacles. This also leads to a non-monotonic ratchet effect magnitude as a function of obstacle size, so that there is an optimal obstacle size for ratcheting at fixed activity.</description>

Abstract: Modern detector technology and highly brilliant fourth-generation synchrotrons allow to improve the temporal resolution in time-resolved diffraction studies. Profiting from this, we applied temperature scanning X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a Pt-based metallic glass former in the glass, glass transition region, and supercooled liquid, covering up to six orders of magnitude in time scales. Our data demonstrates that the structural alpha-relaxation process is still observable in the glass, although it is partially masked by a faster source of decorrelation observed at atomic scale. We present an approach that interprets these findings as the superposition of heterogeneous liquid-like and stress-driven ballistic-like atomic motions. This work not only extends the dynamical range probed by standard isothermal XPCS, but also clarifies the fate of the alpha-relaxation across the glass transition and provides a new perception on the anomalous, compressed temporal decay of the density-density correlation functions observed in metallic glasses and many out-of-equilibrium soft materials.</description>

      <title>Triboelectrically mediated self-assembly and manipulation of drops at an interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fluid-fluid interface is a complex environment for a floating object where the statics and dynamics may be governed by capillarity, gravity, inertia, and other external body forces. Yet, the alignment of these forces in intricate ways might result in beautiful pattern formation and self-assembly of these objects, as in the case of bubble rafts or colloidal particles. While interfacial self-assembly has been explored widely, controlled manipulation of floating objects, e.g. drops, at the fluid-fluid interface still remains a challenge largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal the self-assembly and manipulation of water drops floating at an oil-air interface. We show that the assembly occurs due to electrostatic interactions between the drops and their environment. We highlight the role of the boundary surrounding the system by showing that even drops with a net zero electric charge can self-assemble under certain conditions. Using experiments and theory, we show that the depth of the oil bath plays an important role in setting the distance between the self-assembled drops. Furthermore, we demonstrate ways to manipulate the drops actively and passively at the interface.</description>
