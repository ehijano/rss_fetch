      <title>When Support Hides Progress: Insights from a Physics Tutorial on Solving Laplace's Equation Using Separation of Variables in Cartesian Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrostatic potential in certain types of boundary value problems can be found by solving Laplace's Equation (LE). To develop students' ability for solving problems that can be solved effectively using Laplace's equation in an upper-level electricity and magnetism course, we developed and validated a tutorial focused on finding electrostatic potential in a Cartesian coordinate system. The tutorial was implemented across three instructors' classes, accompanied by scaffolded pretest and posttest. We also conducted think-aloud interviews with advanced students using both unscaffolded and scaffolded versions of the pretest and posttest. Findings reveal common student difficulties that were included in the tutorial as a guide to help address them. The difference in the performance of students from the pretest to the posttest was similar on the scaffolded version of the tests for all three instructors' classes and interviewed students. Equally importantly, interviewed students demonstrated greater differences in scores from the pretest and posttest on the unscaffolded versions, suggesting that the scaffolded version of the tests may have obscured evidence of actual learning from the tutorial. While a scaffolded test is typically intended to guide students through complex reasoning by breaking a problem into sub-problems and offering structured support, it can limit opportunities to demonstrate independent problem-solving and evidence of learning from the tutorial. Additionally, one instructor's class underperformed relative to others even on the pretest. This instructor had mentioned that the tests and tutorial were not relevant to their current course syllabus and offered a small amount of extra credit for attempting to help education researchers, highlighting how this type of instructor framing of instructional tasks can negatively impact student engagement and performance.</description>

      <title>Becoming a physicist: Major educational transition points impact women's physics self-efficacy and sense of belonging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this investigation, we analyzed individual interviews with six female undergraduate physics majors at a large, public, research university in the US to understand their progression at different transition points to becoming physicists. Following the frameworks of standpoint theory, Schlossberg's transition theory, and domains of power, we focused our analysis on how these women initially developed an interest in physics before coming to college and how important transition points in college impacted their physics self-efficacy and sense of belonging. We find that the transitions from high school to college introductory courses and then into the physics major were bottlenecks at which women faced new challenges. Our findings suggest that although women develop initial fascinations with physics in a myriad of unique and interesting ways, they tend to follow a similar trajectory that harms their physics self-efficacy and sense of belonging over time. Finally, although we focused on women who had persisted in pursuing a physics degree thus far, their accounts point to an unsupportive physics culture that could drive other women and students from marginalized demographic groups out of the discipline.</description>
