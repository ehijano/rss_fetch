      <title>Numerical investigation on solids settling in a non-Newtonian slurry inside a horizontal flume</title>

Abstract: Slurry transportation is always crucial for many industrial processes. This study numerically investigates the settling behavior of multisize solid particles in a non-newtonian slurry inside a semicircular open channel (flume). The non-newtonian slurry is modelled using a three-dimensional (3D) unsteady Eulerian-Eulerian (E-E) model coupled with the Hershel-Bulkley (HB) rheological model. A detailed sensitivity analysis of drag models is performed to establish the solid-fluid interaction in the slurry flow. The numerical model is validated with the experimental data from the literature and shows a fair agreement. The validated model is used to simulate the settling behavior of the slurry in the flume. The mean particle diameter of the solid particles in the slurry is in the range of 75-296 $\mu$m with a median diameter of 188 $\mu$m. The effect of particle size distributions (PSDs), flume inclination, bubble size and bubble volume fraction on the particle settling inside the flume is investigated in the parametric study. The analysis of our results revealed that the settling of solids is significantly affected by PSDs in the open channel system. In particular, the increase in flume inclination progresses the settling and dissipation of fine and coarse particles, respectively. Additional simulations showed that the inception of bubbles influences the settling velocity of solids, which changes the settling behavior of multisize solids inside the flume. The presented study can be used as a valuable guideline for the optimisation of intermediate exclusion of water from thickened slurry in order to ensure the stability of tailing storage facility.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>

Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>
