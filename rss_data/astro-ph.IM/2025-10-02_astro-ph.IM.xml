      <title>AstroMMBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models Capabilities in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical image interpretation presents a significant challenge for applying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specialized scientific tasks. Existing benchmarks focus on general multimodal capabilities but fail to capture the complexity of astronomical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in astronomical image understanding. AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice questions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain experts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25 diverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using AstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall accuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong closed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six astrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like cosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively better in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These findings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like AstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their targeted development for scientific applications. AstroMMBench provides a foundational resource and a dynamic tool to catalyze advancements at the intersection of AI and astronomy.</description>

      <title>Technosignatures of Self-Replicating Probes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a much-neglected area of SETI: solar system techno-signatures. As our cursory solar system exploration consolidates into commercial industrialisation, it is crucial that we determine what to look for and where. We first consider the rationale for interstellar self-replicating probes and their implications for the Fermi paradox. Whether for defensive or exploratory reasons, self-replicating probes are a rational strategy for Galactic investigation. We determine that self-replicating probes will systematically explore the Galaxy by tracking resources of sufficient metallicity. We focus on the resource requirements of a self-replicating interstellar probe that may have visited our solar system. After considering asteroid resources, we suggest that evidence of asteroidal processing will be difficult to discern from natural processes given the constraints imposed by self-replication. We further determine that the Moon is an ideal base of manufacturing operations. We suggest that nuclear reactors, such as the Magnox reactor model, can feasibly be constructed from lunar resources which will have left isotopic ratio signatures of Th-232/Nd-144 and/or Th-232/Ba-137. We further suggest that in anticipatory economic trade for resources, a self-replicating probe may have left artefacts buried with asteroidal resources on the Moon. Such gifts would be detectable and accessible only once a threshold of technological sophistication has been achieved. An obvious gift in trade for the resources utilised would be a universal constructor.</description>

      <title>Architecturally Constrained Solutions to Ill-Conditioned Problems in QUBIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a new physics-guided Machine Learning framework, with which we solve the generally non-invertible, ill-conditioned problems through an analytical approach and constrain the solution to the approximate inverse with the architecture of Neural Networks. By informing the networks of the underlying physical processes, the method optimizes data usage and enables interpretability of the model while simultaneously allowing estimation of detector properties and the propagation of their corresponding uncertainties. The method is applied in reconstructing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps observed with the novel interferometric QUBIC experiment aimed at measuring the tensor-to-scalar ratio r.</description>

      <title>Updates to the WFC3/UVIS Saturation Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calwf3 software for WFC3/UVIS utilizes a reference file to flag pixels that are saturated beyond their full-well depth. Previously, this was accomplished using a constant threshold of 65,500 e$^{-}$ across the entire detector. In this study, we retrieved $\sim$1 million stars from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) to determine the flux level at which the Point Spread Function begins to flatten, which occurs as the central pixel saturates. We quantified the saturation limit as a function of position on the detector in 1,024 discrete regions, and interpolated to a pixel-by-pixel saturation map to construct a spatially-variable saturation map reference file that is now implemented in the calwf3 calibration pipeline. We find the saturation varies by 13% across the UVIS detectors, from 63,465 e$^{-}$ to 72,356 e$^{-}$. These values agree well with earlier studies using sparser datasets, with the current analysis leading to improved characterization on small scales. Critically, the revised saturation values are larger than the previous constant threshold over 87% of the UVIS detector, leading to the recovery of usable science pixels near bright sources. This update greatly improves the robustness of saturation flags in the Data Quality arrays of observations obtained with WFC3/UVIS, and users are encouraged to redownload their data from MAST to benefit from the improved flags.</description>

      <title>Automated Modeling with AAP-Imfit: Astrometry and Photometry via CASA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution radio intensity maps, crucial for detailed studies of compact sources like active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their relativistic jets. Analyzing jet components in these maps traditionally involves manual Gaussian fitting, a time-consuming bottleneck for large datasets. To address this, we present an automated batch-processing tool, based on the Gaussian fitting capabilities of CASA, designed to streamline VLBI jet component characterization (AAP-Imfit). Our algorithm sets a detection limit, performs automatic 2D Gaussian fitting, and removes model artifacts, efficiently extracting component flux densities and positions. This method enables systematic and reproducible analysis, significantly reducing the time required for fitting extensive VLBI datasets. We validated AAP-Imfit by using VLBI observations of the blazars 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, comparing our results with published fits. The close agreement in residual root mean square (RMS) values and model/residual-to-map RMS ratios confirms the accuracy of our automated approach in reproducing original flux distributions. While visual inspection remains important for complex or faint features, this routine significantly accelerates VLBI component fitting, paving the way for large-scale statistical studies of jet dynamics.</description>

      <title>ADARI: Visualizing the quality of VLT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ADARI (Astronomical DAta Reporting Infrastructure) is a system designed for creating graphical reports of astronomical data so that the quality of these products can be assessed. It has been designed from the ground up to be backend-agnostic, meaning the same ADARI code can be sent to a web plotting API, or a code-based plotting API, with no alteration.
  Quick data inspection is an important feature in data reduction systems. The use cases range from quality control at the telescope, advance quality checks prior to delivering data to the scientists as well as data inspection for users running the pipelines at their home institutes. The goal of ADARI is to deliver the same experience and code for data visualization for all the environments, either running automatically in the Paranal Observatory environment or at the PI premises.
  ADARI contains a library that can be used to develop the creation of reports as well as a command line tool (genreport) to execute such reports. Most of the time the reports are generated as part of the execution of a data reduction workflow implemented with EDPS, the new ESO system for automatically organising data from ESO instruments and for running the reduction pipelines on them.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Characterization of All DC/RF Routing Wafers for Detector Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background experiment with over 67,000 polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors currently installed for use in observations and plans to increase the total detector count to ${\sim}$98,000 detectors with the Advanced SO upgrade. The TES arrays are packaged into Universal Focal-Plane Modules (UFMs), which also contain the multiplexing readout circuit. Within a readout module, a DC/RF routing wafer provides a cold interface between the detectors and the readout multiplexing chips. Each routing wafer hosts twelve bias lines, which contain the ${\sim}$400 ${\mu}{\Omega}$ shunt resistors that are part of the TES bias circuitry. More than 70 routing wafers have been fabricated and tested both at room temperature and 100 mK before integration into UFMs. The lab measurements for all screened wafers have been compiled to show the distribution of measured average shunt resistance Rsh for each bias line, both across bias lines on a single routing wafer and across all routing wafers. The mean average shunt resistance for all wafers was found to be 396 ${\mu}{\Omega}$ with a standard deviation of 16 ${\mu}{\Omega}$, or ${\sim}$4%. For each wafer, we note good uniformity of average Rsh between bias lines, with a slight downward trend with increasing distance from the center of the wafer. The fabrication data collected at room temperature shows agreement with the cryogenic measurements of Rsh distribution.</description>

      <title>Progress towards stereo observation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the most energetic particles ever detected. Cosmic rays that achieve the highest energies are rare, and their flux at Earth is extremely low. As a result, next-generation experiments with large effective areas are required and under development. The Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes (FAST) is one such project. Although observation time is limited compared with ground particle detectors, it enables direct measurements of $X_\mathrm{max}$, a crucial parameter sensitive to the primary cosmic-ray composition. FAST will achieve large-area coverage by significantly reducing the cost of telescopes. This necessitates a simplified telescope compared to conventional designs. Demonstrating the feasibility of our telescope and observational method is essential. To validate the FAST concept, prototype telescopes have been deployed at the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array experiment.</description>

      <title>The trigger design for AdvCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdvCam is a next-generation camera for the Large-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, based on silicon photomultipliers. Its fully digital readout system enables the design of new, sophisticated trigger logic. The Large-Sized Telescopes aim to cover the low-energy range of the cosmic gamma-ray spectrum, with a threshold starting at about 20 GeV, using the existing photomultiplier tube camera. The AdvCam, along with the new trigger logic, as shown by simulations, lowers the detectable energy threshold to 13 GeV. The proposed trigger logic has a multilevel structure. The first level involves fast coincidences among small pixel regions at a rate of approximately 1 GHz, while the second level processes all camera pixels within an approximately 10-nanosecond time window. Different families of machine learning algorithms optimized for FPGAs form the second-level trigger. In this work, we consider two main approaches: Deep Neural Networks and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, both running with latencies below 1 microsecond at a 1 MHz rate. This work provides a detailed description of the trigger chain and its performance, as studied through simulation.</description>

      <title>The Silicon Strip Detector Subsystem for the Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder for the International Space Station (TIGERISS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder for the International Space Station (TIGERISS) is under construction and is planned for launch in 2027 and will be attached at the SOX location on the Columbus module on the ISS. TIGERISS will make the first definitive measurements of Ultra-Heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays (UHGCRs; Z &gt;29) on an individual element basis past barium ($^{56}$Ba), through the lanthinides, and to lead ($^{82}$Pb). TIGERISS has a geometry factor of 1.06 m$^2$ sr and is comprised of four planes of single-sided silicon strip detectors (SSDs) arranged in orthogonal X-Y layers with an X-Y pair above and an X-Y pair below two large-area Cherenkov detectors. The top Cherenkov detector is comprised of a mosaic of aerogel radiators (n =1.05) while the bottom Cherenkov detector has an acrylic radiator (n = 1.49). The combination of the Cherenkov velocity measurements with the precise measurements of the ionization and trajectory of the traversing cosmic rays leads to highly accurate charge measurements of $&lt;$ 0.25 c.u. over the entire elemental range of $^5$B through $^{82}$Pb. These TIGERISS measurements are highly sensitive in determining the strength of s-process, r-process, and rp-processes of Galactic nucleosynthesis while providing critical data needed for multi-messenger studies to determine the contributions of extreme phenomena, including supernovae (SN) and Neutron Star Mergers (NSMs), in the production of galactic matter. The science goals of TIGERISS, mission status, instrument design and performance of the TIGERISS SSD subsystem in relation to the measurements and science goals of TIGERISS are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>What's in Your Transit? Towards Reliably Getting $5\times$ More Science from Exoplanet Transit Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanetary science heavily relies on transit depth ($D$) measurements. Yet, as instrumental precision increases, the uncertainty on $D$ appears to increasingly drift from expectations driven solely by photon-noise. Here we characterize this shortfall (the Transit-Depth Precision Problem, TDPP), by defining an amplification factor, $A$, quantifying the discrepancy between the measured transit-depth uncertainty and the measured baseline scatter on a same time bin size. While in theory $A$ should be $\sim\sqrt{3}$, we find that it can reach values $\gtrsim$10 notably due to correlations between $D$ and the limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs). This means that (1) the performance of transit-based exoplanet studies (e.g., atmospheric studies) can be substantially improved with reliable priors on LDCs and (2) low-fidelity priors on the LDCs can yield substantial biases on $D$--potentially affecting atmospheric studies due to the wavelength-dependence of such biases. For the same reason, biases may emerge on stellar-density and planet-shape/limb-asymmetry measurements. With current photometric precisions, we recommend using a 3$^{\rm rd}$-order polynomial law and a 4$^{\rm th}$-order non-linear law, as they provide an optimal compromise between bias and $A$, while testing the fidelity for each parametrization. While their use combined with existing LDC priors (10-20% uncertainty) currently implies $A\sim10$, we show that targeted improvements to limb-darkening models can bring $A$ down to $\sim2$. Improving stellar models and transit-fitting practices is thus essential to fully exploit transit datasets, and reliably increasing their scientific yield by $5\times$, thereby enabling the same science with up to $25\times$ fewer transits.</description>

      <title>Accelerating SED Modeling of Astrophysical Objects Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of astrophysical objects with physically motivated models is computationally expensive. These models require solving coupled differential equations in high-dimensional parameter spaces, making traditional fitting techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling prohibitive. A key example is modeling non-thermal emission from blazar jets - relativistic outflows from supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei that are among the most powerful emitters in the Universe. To address this challenge, we employ machine learning to accelerate SED evaluations, enabling efficient Bayesian inference. We generate a large sample of lepto-hadronic blazar emission models and train a neural network (NN) to predict the photon spectrum with strongly reduced run time while preserving accuracy. As a proof of concept, we present an NN-based tool for blazar SED modeling, laying the groundwork for future extensions and for providing an open-access resource for the astrophysics community.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Comparison and Significance: Widespread Errors and how to Correct Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayes factors have become a popular tool in exoplanet spectroscopy for testing atmosphere models against one another. We show that the commonly used method for converting these values into significance "sigmas" is invalid. The formula is neither justified nor recommended by its original paper, and overestimates the confidence of results. We use simple examples to demonstrate the invalidity and prior sensitivity of this approach. We review the standard Bayesian interpretation of the Bayes factor as an odds ratio and recommend its use in conjunction with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion Simplified (BPICS) in future analyses (Python implementations are included) . As a concrete example, we refit the WASP-39 b NIRSpec transmission spectrum to test for the presence of SO$_2$. The prevalent, incorrect significance calculation gives $3.67\sigma$ whereas the standard Bayesian interpretation yields a null model probability $p(\mathcal{B}|y)=0.0044$. Surveying the exoplanet atmosphere literature, we find widespread use of the erroneous formula. In order to avoid overstating observational results and estimating observation times too low, the community should return to the standard Bayesian interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, offering insights into stellar collapse, extreme matter behavior, and cosmic evolution. The advent of multi-messenger astronomy, combining electromagnetic, gravitational wave, and neutrino observations, alongside advances in high-energy polarimetry, is revolutionizing GRB research, enabling deeper exploration of their physical mechanisms.
  This manuscript summarizes how upcoming and proposed space-based missions will tackle key challenges in GRB science, focusing on four areas: (i) identifying high-redshift GRBs to probe the early universe, (ii) enhancing multi-messenger detection and localization, (iii) improving multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB afterglows, and (iv) studying prompt emission polarization to understand jet dynamics and magnetic fields. Highlighting planned missions and their advancements, this work provides a snapshot of current GRB research frontiers, with updates on the evolving status of these missions.</description>

Abstract: This brief study focuses on the application of autoencoders to improve the quality of low-amplitude signals, such as gravitational events. A pre-existing autoencoder was trained using cosmic event data, optimizing its architecture and parameters. The results show a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of the processed signals, demonstrating the potential of autoencoders in the analysis of small signals with multiple sources of interference.</description>

      <title>Toward a Robust R2D2 Paradigm for Radio-interferometric Imaging: Revisiting Deep Neural Network Training and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02554</link>

Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalizability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. First, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomizing Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multiscan multinoise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Second, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Third, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense skip connections, weight normalization, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: an Assessment of Current Acceleration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of CBC source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require at least billions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to less than millions of core hours, which is as high as the cost of analyzing GW events in the past 10 years. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Impact of Detector Calibration Accuracy on Black Hole Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematic errors in detector calibration can bias signal analyses and potentially lead to incorrect interpretations suggesting violations of general relativity. In this study, we investigate how calibration systematics affect black hole (BH) spectroscopy, a technique that uses the quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted during the ringdown phase of gravitational waves (GWs) to study remnant BHs formed in compact binary coalescences. We simulate a series of physically motivated, tunable calibration errors and use them to intentionally miscalibrate numerical relativity waveforms. We then apply a QNM extraction method -- the rational QNM filter -- to quantify the impact of these calibration errors. We find that current calibration standards (errors within $10\%$ in magnitude and $10^\circ$ in phase across the most sensitive frequency range of 20--2000 Hz) are adequate for BH ringdown analyses with existing observations, but insufficient for the accuracy goals of future upgraded and next-generation observatories. Specifically, we show that for events with a high ringdown signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 120$, calibration errors must remain $\lesssim 4\%$ in magnitude and $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in phase to avoid introducing biases. While this analysis focuses on a particular aspect of BH spectroscopy, the results offer quantitative benchmarks for calibration standards crucial to fully realize the potential of precision tests of general relativity in the next-generation detector era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) experiments have transformed our understanding of the Universe by enabling direct observations of compact object mergers and other astrophysical phenomena. This chapter reviews the concepts of GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and describes their operating principles, data acquisition and analysis techniques, and some of the methods used to extract source properties. The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as well, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and cosmology. We also examine the role of multimessenger astronomy and the complementarity between different GW detectors and with other astroparticle experiments. Finally, we outline future prospects with next-generation detectors, like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and space-based missions.</description>
