      <title>Stability and Time-Step Constraints of Exponential Time Differencing Runge--Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Advection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability and time-step constraints for solving advection-diffusion equations using exponential time differencing (ETD) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods in time and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods in space. We demonstrate that the resulting fully discrete scheme is stable when the time-step size is upper bounded by a constant. More specifically, when central fluxes are used for the advection term, the schemes are stable under the time-step constraint tau &lt;= tau_0 * d / a^2, while when upwind fluxes are used, the schemes are stable if tau &lt;= max{tau_0 * d / a^2, c_0 * h / a}. Here, tau is the time-step size, h is the spatial mesh size, and a and d are constants for the advection and diffusion coefficients, respectively. The constant c_0 is the CFL constant for the explicit RK method for the purely advection equation, and tau_0 is a constant that depends on the order of the ETD-RK method. These stability conditions are consistent with those of the implicit-explicit RKDG method. The time-step constraints are rigorously proved for the lowest-order case and are validated through Fourier analysis for higher-order cases. Notably, the constant tau_0 in the fully discrete ETD-RKDG schemes appears to be determined by the stability condition of their semi-discrete (continuous in space, discrete in time) ETD-RK counterparts and is insensitive to the polynomial degree and the specific choice of the DG method. Numerical examples, including problems with nonlinear convection in one and two dimensions, are provided to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ray- and Pixel-Driven Discretization Frameworks in the Strong Operator Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomography is a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to investigate patients' interior features. The Radon transform is commonly used to model the corresponding measurement process. Since in any practical application one can only obtain and process finitely many measurements, suitable discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the backprojection) is crucial. The most commonly used discretization approach combines the ray-driven Radon transform with the pixel-driven backprojection, as anecdotal reports describe these as showing the best approximation performance. However, there is little rigorous understanding of induced approximation errors. These methods involve three discretization parameters: the spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. Most commonly, balanced resolutions are used, i.e., the same (or similar) spatial- and detector resolutions. We present a novel interpretation of ray- and pixel-driven discretizations as `convolutional methods'. This allows for a structured analysis that can explain observed behavior. In particular, we prove convergence in the strong operator topology of the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection under suitable choice of discretization parameters. Notably, said suitable parameter choices include the combination of the ray-driven Radon transform with the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions, thus theoretically justifying this approach. Our theoretical investigations are complemented by numerical experiments that show behavior in simulations that the theory predicted or suggested.</description>

      <title>Finite element form-valued forms (I): Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a finite element discretization of $\ell$-form-valued $k$-forms on triangulation in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for general $k$, $\ell$ and $n$ and any polynomial degree. The construction generalizes finite element Whitney forms for the de~Rham complex and their higher-order and distributional versions, the Regge finite elements and the Christiansen--Regge elasticity complex, the TDNNS element for symmetric stress tensors, the MCS element for traceless matrix fields, the Hellan--Herrmann--Johnson (HHJ) elements for biharmonic equations, and discrete divdiv and Hessian complexes in [Hu, Lin, and Zhang, 2025]. The construction discretizes the Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand (BGG) diagrams. Applications of the construction include discretization of strain and stress tensors in continuum mechanics and metric and curvature tensors in differential geometry in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Preserving Finite-Difference Schemes and Auto-B\"acklund Transformations for the Schwarz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that one of the equations from the Lie classification list of second-order ODEs is a first integral of the Schwarz equation. As symmetry-preserving finite-difference schemes have been previously constructed for both equations, the preservation of a similar connection between these schemes is studied. It is shown that the schemes for the Schwarz equation and the second-order ODE can be related through a B\"acklund-type difference transformation. In addition, previously unexamined aspects of the difference scheme for the second-order ODE are discussed, including its singular solution and the complete set of difference first integrals.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision algorithms for solving the Sylvester matrix equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the solution of the general Sylvester equation $AX+XB=C$ in mixed precision. First, we investigate the use of GMRES-based iterative refinement (GMRES-IR) to solve the equation using implicitly its Kronecker product form: we propose an efficient scheme to use the Schur factors of the coefficient matrices as preconditioners, but we demonstrate that this approach is not suitable in the case of the Sylvester equation. By revisiting a stationary iteration for linear systems, we therefore derive a new iterative refinement scheme for the quasi-triangular Sylvester equation, and our rounding error analysis provides sufficient conditions for convergence and a bound on the attainable relative residual. We leverage this iterative scheme to solve the general Sylvester equation in mixed precision. The new algorithms compute the Schur decomposition of the matrix coefficients in low precision, use the low-precision Schur factors to obtain an approximate solution to the quasi-triangular equation, and iteratively refine it to obtain a working-precision solution to the quasi-triangular equation. However, being only orthonormal to low precision, the unitary Schur factors of $A$ and $B$ cannot be used to recover the solution to the original equation. We propose two effective approaches to address this issue: one is based on re-orthonormalization in the working precision, and the other on explicit inversion of the almost-unitary factors. We test these mixed-precision algorithms on various Sylvester and Lyapunov equations from the literature. Our numerical experiments show that, for both classes of equations, the new algorithms are at least as accurate as existing ones. Our cost analysis, on the other hand, suggests that they would typically be faster than mono-precision alternatives if implemented on hardware that natively supports low precision.</description>

      <title>Discretization error analysis for a radially symmetric harmonic map heat flow problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the harmonic map heat flow problem for a radially symmetric case. The corresponding partial dfferential equation plays a key role in many analyses of harmonic map heat flow problems. We consider a basic discretization method for this problem, namely a second order finite difference discretization in space combined with a semi-implicit Euler method in time. The semi-implicit Euler method results in a linear problem in each time step. We restrict to the regime of smooth solutions of the continuous problem and present an error analysis of this discretization method. This results in optimal order discretization error bounds (apart from a logarithmic term). We also present discrete energy estimates that mimic the decrease of the energy of the continuous solution.</description>

      <title>Equilibrated Averaging Residual Method: A General Approach to Conservative Flux Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many equilibrated flux recovery methods for finite element solutions rely on ad hoc or method-specific techniques, limiting their generalizability and efficiency. In this work, we introduce the Equilibrated Averaging Residual Method (EARM), a unified framework for flux recovery that not only reproduces state-of-the-art locally conservative fluxes but also enables the derivation of new equilibrated fluxes with improved properties. In this paper, EARM is applied to conforming, nonconforming, and discontinuous Galerkin methods, ensuring local conservation and robust a posteriori error estimation. Despite the unified nature of the variational problem, the framework retains the flexibility to fully leverage the inherent properties of finite element spaces. Moreover, EARM offers explicit and computationally efficient flux reconstructions for all methods in two dimensions. In three dimensions, only simple local problems need to be solved for the conforming finite element methods.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit for Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20373v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems with different particle species are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian learning in hybrid spin-boson systems can achieve the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown hybrid Hamiltonian system, our algorithm can estimate the Hamiltonian coupling parameters up to root mean square error (RMSE) $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time scaling as $T \sim \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only $\mathcal{O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. Furthermore, it remains robust against small state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. In addition, we also provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the maximum evolution time per measurement. To validate our method, we apply it to the generalized Dicke model for Hamiltonian learning and the spin-boson model for spectrum learning, demonstrating its efficiency in practical quantum systems. These results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision quantum sensing and Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Computer-aided shape features extraction and regression models for predicting the ascending aortic aneurysm growth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: ascending aortic aneurysm growth prediction is still challenging in clinics. In this study, we evaluate and compare the ability of local and global shape features to predict ascending aortic aneurysm growth.
  Material and methods: 70 patients with aneurysm, for which two 3D acquisitions were available, are included. Following segmentation, three local shape features are computed: (1) the ratio between maximum diameter and length of the ascending aorta centerline, (2) the ratio between the length of external and internal lines on the ascending aorta and (3) the tortuosity of the ascending tract. By exploiting longitudinal data, the aneurysm growth rate is derived. Using radial basis function mesh morphing, iso-topological surface meshes are created. Statistical shape analysis is performed through unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares (PLS). Two types of global shape features are identified: three PCA-derived and three PLS-based shape modes. Three regression models are set for growth prediction: two based on gaussian support vector machine using local and PCA-derived global shape features; the third is a PLS linear regression model based on the related global shape features. The prediction results are assessed and the aortic shapes most prone to growth are identified.
  Results: the prediction root mean square error from leave-one-out cross-validation is: 0.112 mm/month, 0.083 mm/month and 0.066 mm/month for local, PCA-based and PLS-derived shape features, respectively. Aneurysms close to the root with a large initial diameter report faster growth.
  Conclusion: global shape features might provide an important contribution for predicting the aneurysm growth.</description>

      <title>A parallel-in-time method based on the Parareal algorithm and High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition with applications to fluid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high cost of sequential time integration is one major constraint that limits the speedup of a time-parallel algorithm like the Parareal algorithm due to the difficulty of coarsening time steps in a stiff numerical problem. To address this challenge, we develop a parallel-in-time approach based on the Parareal algorithm, in which we construct a novel coarse solver using a data-driven method based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition in place of a classic time marching scheme. The proposed solver computes an approximation of the solution using two numerical schemes of different accuracies in parallel, and apply High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to reduce the cost of sequential computations. Compared to the original Parareal algorithm, the proposed approach allows for the construction of low-cost coarse solvers for many complicated stiff problems. We demonstrate through several numerical examples in fluid dynamics that the proposed method can effectively reduce the serial computation cost and improve the parallel speedup of long-time simulations which are hard to accelerate using the original Parareal algorithm.</description>

      <title>Weighted balanced truncation method for approximating kernel functions by exponentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel approximation with exponentials is useful in many problems with convolution quadrature and particle interactions such as integral-differential equations, molecular dynamics and machine learning. This paper proposes a weighted balanced truncation to construct an optimal model reduction method for compressing the number of exponentials in the sum-of-exponentials approximation of kernel functions. This method shows great promise in approximating long-range kernels, achieving over 4 digits of accuracy improvement for the Ewald-splitting and inverse power kernels in comparison with the classical balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate its excellent performance and attractive features for practical applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing parallels with the way biological networks are studied, we adapt the treatment--control paradigm to explainable artificial intelligence research and enrich it through multi-parametric input alterations. In this study, we propose a framework for investigating the internal inference impacted by input data augmentations. The internal changes in network operation are reflected in activation changes measured by variance, which can be decomposed into components related to each augmentation, employing Sobol indices and Shapley values. These quantities enable one to visualize sensitivity to different variables and use them for guided masking of activations. In addition, we introduce a way of single-class sensitivity analysis where the candidates are filtered according to their matching to prediction bias generated by targeted damaging of the activations. Relying on the observed parallels, we assume that the developed framework can potentially be transferred to studying biological neural networks in complex environments.</description>

Abstract: We compute the rate of decay of the persistence probabilities of spherical fractional Brownian motion, which was defined by L\'evy (1965) and Istas (2005). The rate resembles the Euclidean case treated in Molchan (1999).
  As a by-product we consider the coefficients of series representations of functions with algebraic endpoint singularities in terms of re-scaled Gegenbauer polynomials, which partly generalises Sidi (2009).</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional varying-order NURBS discretization method for enhanced IGA of large deformation frictional contact problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a varying-order (VO) NURBS discretization method to enhance the performance of the IGA technique for three-dimensional large deformation frictional contact problems. Based on the promising results obtained with the previous work on the 2D isogeometric contact analysis, the present work extends the capability of the method for tri-variate NURBS discretization. The proposed method enables independent employment of the user-defined higher-order NURBS for the discretization of the contact surface and the minimum order of NURBS for the remaining solid volume. Such a method provides the possibility to refine a NURBS solid with the controllable order elevation-based approach while preserving its volume parametrization at a fixed mesh. The advantages of the method are twofold. First, the higher-order NURBS for the evaluation of contact integral enhances the accuracy of the contact responses at a fixed mesh, hence fully exploiting the advantage of higher-order NURBS specifically for contact computations. Second, the minimum order of NURBS for the computations in the remaining volume considerably reduces the computational cost associated with the uniform order NURBS-based isogeometric contact analyses.
  The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated using various contact problems with or without considering friction between deformable solids. The results with the standard uniform order of NURBS-based discretization are also included to provide a comparative assessment. We show that to attain similar accuracy results, the VO NURBS discretization uses a much coarser mesh resolution than the standard NURBS-based discretization, leading to a major gain in computational efficiency for isogeometric contact analysis. The convergence study demonstrates the consistent performance of the method for efficient IGA of three-dimensional (3D) frictional contact problems.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Bayesian filtering for high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering for high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems is a fundamental yet challenging problem in many fields of science and engineering. Existing methods face significant obstacles: Gaussian-based filters struggle with non-Gaussian distributions, while sequential Monte Carlo methods are computationally intensive and prone to particle degeneracy in high dimensions. Although generative models in machine learning have made significant progress in modeling high-dimensional non-Gaussian distributions, their inefficiency in online updating limits their applicability to filtering problems. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-based Bayesian filter (FBF) that integrates normalizing flows to construct a novel latent linear state-space model with Gaussian filtering distributions. This framework facilitates efficient density estimation and sampling using invertible transformations provided by normalizing flows, and it enables the construction of filters in a data-driven manner, without requiring prior knowledge of system dynamics or observation models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of FBF.</description>

      <title>Stable algorithms for general linear systems by preconditioning the normal equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the solution of nonsymmetric linear systems by preconditioned Krylov methods based on the normal equations, LSQR in particular. On some examples, preconditioned LSQR is seen to produce errors many orders of magnitude larger than classical direct methods; this paper demonstrates that the attainable accuracy of preconditioned LSQR can be greatly improved by applying iterative refinement or restarting when the accuracy stalls. This observation is supported by rigorous backward error analysis. This paper also provides a discussion of the relative merits of GMRES and LSQR for solving nonsymmetric linear systems, demonstrates stability for left-preconditioned LSQR without iterative refinement, and shows that iterative refinement can also improve the accuracy of preconditioned conjugate gradient.</description>

      <title>A nodally bound-preserving finite element method for time-dependent convection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method to approximate the time-dependent convection-diffusion equations using conforming finite element methods, ensuring that the discrete solution respects the physical bounds imposed by the differential equation. The method is built by defining, at each time step, a convex set of admissible finite element functions (that is, the ones that satisfy the global bounds at their degrees of freedom) and seeks for a discrete solution in this admissible set. A family of $\theta$-schemes is used as time integrators, and well-posedness of the discrete schemes is proven for the whole family, but stability and optimal-order error estimates are proven for the implicit Euler scheme. Nevertheless, our numerical experiments show that the method also provides stable and optimally-convergent solutions when the Crank-Nicolson method is used.</description>

      <title>A sharp-interface approach for simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films with double-bubble structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a sharp-interface model for solid-state dewetting of double-bubble thin films using an energy variational approach based on a newly proposed interfacial energy. This model characterizes the dynamic evolution of interfaces in double-bubble thin films, a process primarily governed by surface diffusion and junction/contact points migration, and fundamentally distinct from the behavior observed in a single thin film. Subsequently, a structure-preserving parametric finite element approximation is developed for the sharp-interface model, which can preserve both area conservation and energy stability. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the convergence, structure-preserving properties, and superior mesh quality of the proposed method. Additionally, we investigate several specific evolution processes, including the equilibrium shapes of double-bubble thin films and the pinch-off dynamics of long islands.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning without Global Optimization by Random Fourier Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new training algorithm for deep neural networks that utilize random complex exponential activation functions. Our approach employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure to iteratively train network layers, avoiding global and gradient-based optimization while maintaining error control. It consistently attains the theoretical approximation rate for residual networks with complex exponential activation functions, determined by network complexity. Additionally, it enables efficient learning of multiscale and high-frequency features, producing interpretable parameter distributions. Despite using sinusoidal basis functions, we do not observe Gibbs phenomena in approximating discontinuous target functions.</description>

      <title>Lie Algebra Canonicalization: Equivariant Neural Operators under arbitrary Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for robust and generalizable machine learning models has driven recent interest in exploiting symmetries through equivariant neural networks. In the context of PDE solvers, recent works have shown that Lie point symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through data and loss augmentation. Despite this, directly enforcing equivariance within the model architecture for these problems remains elusive. This is because many PDEs admit non-compact symmetry groups, oftentimes not studied beyond their infinitesimal generators, making them incompatible with most existing equivariant architectures. In this work, we propose Lie aLgebrA Canonicalization (LieLAC), a novel approach that exploits only the action of infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group, circumventing the need for knowledge of the full group structure. To achieve this, we address existing theoretical issues in the canonicalization literature, establishing connections with frame averaging in the case of continuous non-compact groups. Operating within the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with unconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form before feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for model inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie group descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models. Finally, we showcase LieLAC's efficacy on tasks of invariant image classification and Lie point symmetry equivariant neural PDE solvers using pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Comments and extensions on "State-equivalent form and minimum-order compensator design for rectangular descriptor systems"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical note presents a counterexample showing that the equivalence conditions proposed by Geng et al. (IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 2024), which use a minimum-order compensator (MOC) to achieve desired designs, including generalized regularity or both generalized regularity and free of impulse, are sufficient but not necessary. Furthermore, revised equivalence conditions are introduced, along with an equivalence condition ensuring the closed-loop system remains generalized regular, impulse-free, and stable using MOC. Additionally, it is shown that output feedback can replace the MOC, achieving the same design without increasing dimensionality. These findings are validated through a circuit example.</description>
