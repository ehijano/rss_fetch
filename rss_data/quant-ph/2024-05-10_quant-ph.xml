      <title>Information revival without backflow: non-causal explanations of non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of information revivals, witnessing the violation of certain data-processing inequalities, has provided an important paradigm in the study of non-Markovian processes. Although often used interchangeably, we argue here that the notions of ``revivals'' and ``backflows'', i.e., flows of information from the environment back into the system, are distinct: an information revival can occur without any backflow ever taking place. In this paper, we examine in detail the phenomenon of non-causal revivals and relate them to the theory of short Markov chains and squashed non-Markovianity. As a byproduct, we demonstrate that focusing on processes with actual backflows, while excluding those with only non-causal revivals, resolves the issue of non-convexity of Markovianity, thus enabling the construction of a convex resource theory of genuine non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Barren plateaus are swamped with traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two main challenges preventing efficient training of variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning models are local minima and barren plateaus. Typically, barren plateaus are associated with deep circuits, while shallow circuits have been shown to suffer from suboptimal local minima. We point out a simple mechanism that creates exponentially many poor local minima specifically in the barren plateau regime. These local minima are trivial solutions, optimizing only a few terms in the loss function, leaving the rest on their barren plateaus. More precisely, we show the existence of approximate local minima, optimizing a single loss term, and conjecture the existence of exact local minima, optimizing only a logarithmic fraction of all loss function terms. One implication of our findings is that simply yielding large gradients is not sufficient to render an initialization strategy a meaningful solution to the barren plateau problem.</description>

      <title>Wave Function Collapse, Lorentz Invariance, and the Third Postulate of Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The changes that quantum states undergo during measurement are both probabilistic and nonlocal. These two characteristics complement one another to insure compatibility with relativity and maintain conservation laws. Nonlocal entanglement relations provide a means to enforce conservation laws in a probabilistic theory, while the probabilistic nature of nonlocal effects prevents the superluminal transmission of information. In order to explain these measurement-induced changes in terms of fundamental physical processes it is necessary to take these two key characteristics into account. One way to do this is to modify the Schroedinger equation by adding stochastic, nonlinear terms. A number of such proposals have been made over the past few decades. A recently proposed equation based on the assumption that wave function collapse is induced by a sequence of correlating interactions of the kind that constitute measurements has been shown to maintain strict adherence to conservation laws in individual instances, and has also eliminated the need to introduce any new, ad hoc physical constants. In this work it is shown that this modified Schroedinger equation is naturally Lorentz invariant. It is further argued that the additional spacetime structures that it requires provide a way to implement the assumption that spacelike-separated operators (and measurements) commute, and that this assumption of local commutativity should be regarded as a third postulate of relativity.</description>

      <title>Characterization of errors in a CNOT between surface code patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As current experiments already realize small quantum circuits on error corrected qubits, it is important to fully understand the effect of physical errors on the logical error channels of these fault-tolerant circuits. Here, we investigate a lattice-surgery-based CNOT operation between two surface code patches under phenomenological error models. (i) For two-qubit logical Pauli measurements -- the elementary building block of the CNOT -- we optimize the number of stabilizer measurement rounds, usually taken equal to $d$, the size (code distance) of each patch. We find that the optimal number can be greater or smaller than $d$, depending on the rate of physical and readout errors, and the separation between the code patches. (ii) We fully characterize the two-qubit logical error channel of the lattice-surgery-based CNOT. We find a symmetry of the CNOT protocol, that results in a symmetry of the logical error channel. We also find that correlations between X and Z errors on the logical level are suppressed under minimum weight decoding.</description>

      <title>Optical single-shot readout of spin qubits in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital revolution was enabled by nanostructured devices made from silicon. A similar prominence of this material is anticipated in the upcoming quantum era as the unrivalled maturity of silicon nanofabrication offers unique advantages for integration and up-scaling, while its favorable material properties facilitate quantum memories with hour-long coherence. While small spin-qubit registers have exceeded error-correction thresholds, their connection to large quantum computers is an outstanding challenge. To this end, spin qubits with optical interfaces offer key advantages: they can minimize the heat load and give access to modular quantum computing architectures that eliminate cross-talk and offer a large connectivity via room-temperature photon routing. Here, we implement such an efficient spin-photon interface based on erbium dopants in a nanophotonic resonator. We thus demonstrate optical single-shot readout of a spin in silicon whose coherence exceeds the Purcell-enhanced optical lifetime, paving the way for entangling remote spins via photon interference. As erbium dopants can emit coherent photons in the minimal-loss band of optical fibers, and tens of such qubits can be spectrally multiplexed in each resonator, the demonstrated hardware platform offers unique promise for distributed quantum information processing and the implementation of a quantum internet based on integrated silicon devices.</description>

      <title>Many-time physics in practice: characterising and controlling non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every year, substantial theoretical and experimental progress is made towards the realisation of a genuinely new computational paradigm in the construction of a quantum computer. But progress is fractal; to make headway is to unearth the next set of obstacles. Decades of work has so far overcome physical, mathematical, engineering, and information theoretic obstacles to produce the remarkable high-fidelity devices we see today. But these devices must be near perfect to be useful. Indeed, advancements so far have precipitated sensitivity to a host of complex dynamical and control-based effects. Chief among these today are non-Markovian memory effects, where interactions between a quantum system and its surrounding environment can give rise to multi-time correlations. In this thesis, we address this issue and formally present a generalisation of quantum process tomography, called process tensor tomography (PTT). This establishes the ability to rigorously and systematically characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems, resolving many long-standing issues in the field. In the first part of this work, we present an original review of the literature and motivate the problem at hand. In the second, we develop the framework of PTT, including experiment design, post-processing algorithms, and both simulated and near-term device demonstrations. In particular, we demonstrate this as a tool for obtaining in-depth diagnostics about the nature and origin of temporal quantum correlations. Lastly, we dedicate our efforts to efficiency and self-consistency. To this effect, we explore theoretically processes with sparse memory structures. We then leverage this to develop various efficient estimation techniques tailored for different settings. The result is a robust and lightweight framework capable of both reconstructing and optimally controlling any non-Markovian open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep thermalization in continuous-variable quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover emergent universality arising in the equilibration dynamics of multimode continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we study the ensemble of pure states supported on a small subsystem of a few modes, generated by Gaussian measurements on the remaining modes of a globally pure bosonic Gaussian state. We find that beginning from sufficiently complex global states, such as random Gaussian states and product squeezed states coupled via a deep array of linear optical elements, the induced ensemble attains a universal form, independent of the choice of measurement basis: it is composed of unsqueezed coherent states whose displacements are distributed normally and isotropically, with variance depending on only the particle-number density of the system. We further show that the emergence of such a universal form is consistent with a generalized maximum entropy principle, which endows the limiting ensemble, which we call the "Gaussian Scrooge distribution", with a special quantum information-theoretic property of having minimal accessible information. Our results represent a conceptual generalization of the recently introduced notion of "deep thermalization" in discrete-variable quantum many-body systems -- a novel form of equilibration going beyond thermalization of local observables -- to the realm of continuous-variable quantum systems. Moreover, it demonstrates how quantum information-theoretic perspectives can unveil new physical phenomena and principles in quantum dynamics and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Achieving millisecond coherence fluxonium through overlap Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluxonium qubits are recognized for their high coherence times and high operation fidelities, attributed to their unique design incorporating over 100 Josephson junctions per superconducting loop. However, this complexity poses significant fabrication challenges, particularly in achieving high yield and junction uniformity with traditional methods. Here, we introduce an overlap process for Josephson junction fabrication that achieves nearly 100% yield and maintains uniformity across a 2-inch wafer with less than 5% variation for the phase slip junction and less than 2% for the junction array. Our compact junction array design facilitates fluxonium qubits with energy relaxation times exceeding 1 millisecond at the flux frustration point, demonstrating consistency with state-of-the-art dielectric loss tangents and flux noise across multiple devices. This work suggests the scalability of high coherence fluxonium processors using CMOS-compatible processes, marking a significant step towards practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Investigating impact of bit-flip errors in control electronics on quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of bit flip errors in FPGA memories in control electronics on quantum computing systems. FPGA memories are integral in storing the amplitude and phase information pulse envelopes, which are essential for generating quantum gate pulses. However, these memories can incur faults due to physical and environmental stressors such as electromagnetic interference, power fluctuations, and temperature variations and adversarial fault injections, potentially leading to errors in quantum gate operations. To understand how these faults affect quantum computations, we conducted a series of experiments to introduce bit flips into the amplitude (both real and imaginary components) and phase values of quantum pulses using IBM's simulated quan- tum environments, FakeValencia, FakeManila, and FakeLima. Our findings reveal that bit flips in the exponent and initial mantissa bits of the real amplitude cause substantial deviations in quantum gate operations, with TVD increases as high as ~200%. Interestingly, the remaining bits exhibited natural tolerance to errors. We proposed a 3-bit repetition error correction code, which effectively reduced the TVD increases to below 40% without incurring any memory overhead. Due to reuse of less significant bits for error correction, the proposed approach introduces maximum of 5-7% extra TVD in nominal cases. However, this can be avoided by sacrificing memory area for implementing the repetition code.</description>

      <title>Sudden change of interferometric power for X shape states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interferometric power (IP) is a discordlike measure. We study the dynamics of IP for two-qubit X shape states under different noisy environments. Our study shows that IP exhibits sudden change, and one side quantum channel is enough for the occurrence of a sudden change of IP. In particular, we show that the initial state having no sudden change of quantum discord exhibits a sudden change of IP under the dynamics of amplitude noise, but the converse is not true. Besides, we also investigate the dynamics of IP under two different kinds of composite noises. Our results also confirm that sudden change of IP occurs under such composite noises.</description>

      <title>Onset of Quantum Thermalization in Jahn-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of quantum thermalization in a system governed by the Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian which describes the interaction between a single spin and two bosonic modes. We find that the Jahn-Teller model exhibits a finite-size quantum phase transition between the normal phase and two types of super-radiant phase when the ratios of spin-level splitting to each of the two bosonic frequencies grow to infinity. We test the prediction of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in the Jahn-Teller model. We show that the expectation value of the spin observable quickly approaches its long-time average value. We find that the distance between the diagonal ensemble average and the microcanonical ensemble average of the spin observable decreases with the effective thermodynamic parameter. Furthermore, we show that the mean-time fluctuations of the spin observable are small and are inversely proportional to the effective system dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various aspects of entropy of a complicated cavity QED system are explored. Atoms are held in optical cavities through optical tweezers and can jump between different cavities through the tunneling effect. The interaction of atom with the cavity results in electronic transitions and the creation and annihilation of photon. Covalent bond and phonon are introduced into the model. The effect of all kinds of interactions on entropy is studied. At the same time, the von Neumann entropy of different subsystems is compared. The results show that by selectively choosing system parameters, the entropic dynamics can be controlled.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "non-commutative probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series will address the projection postulate and the question of measurement in this approach.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Topological Polaritons in Optomechanical Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to manipulate topological polaritons in optomechanical ladders consisting of an optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain and a mechanical SSH chain connected through optomechanical (interchain) interactions. We show that the topological phase diagrams are divided into six areas by four boundaries and that there are four topological phases characterized by the Berry phases. We find that a topologically nontrivial phase of the polaritons is generated by the optomechanical interaction between the optical and mechanical SSH chains even though they are both in the topologically trivial phases. Counter-intuitively, six edge states appear in one of the topological phases with only two topological nontrivial bands, and some edge states are localized near but not at the boundaries of an open-boundary ladder. Moreover, a two-dimensional Chern insulator with higher Chern numbers is simulated by introducing proper periodical adiabatic modulations of the driving amplitude and frequency. Our work not only opens a route towards topological polaritons manipulation by optomachanical interactions, but also will exert a far-reaching influence on designing topologically protected polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Everything is Entangled in Quantum Mechanics: Are the Orthodox Measures Physically Meaningful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though quantum entanglement is today's most essential concept within the new technological era of quantum information processing, we do not only lack a consistent definition of this kernel notion, we are also far from understanding its physical meaning [35]. These failures have lead to many problems when attempting to provide a consistent measure or quantification of entanglement. In fact, the two main lines of contemporary research within the orthodox literature have created mazes where inconsistencies and problems are found everywhere. While the operational-instrumentalist approach has failed to explain how inequalities are able to distinguish the classical from the quantum, the geometrical approach has failed to provide a consistent meaningful account of their entropic measure. Taking distance from orthodoxy, in this work we address the quantification and measure of quantum entanglement by considering a recently presented objective-invariant definition in terms of the coding of intensive relations [21] which allows to escape the widespread relativist account of bases and factorizations [24, 25]. Going beyond the orthodox dualistic reference to "quantum particles" and "clicks" in detectors, we will argue that this new line of research is capable not only to evade the many open problems which appear within the mainstream literature, but is also able to present a consistent and coherent physical understanding of entanglement. The main conclusion of this work is that in quantum mechanics --contrary to what is generally presupposed-- all operational expressions found within the laboratory are intrinsically entangled.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Theories beyond Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of quantum resource theories, based on non-convex star-shape sets, presented in this work captures the key quantum properties that cannot be studied by standard convex theories. We provide operational interpretations for a resource of this class and demonstrate its advantage to improve performance of correlated quantum discrimination tasks and testing of quantum combs. Proposed techniques provide useful tools to describe quantum discord, total correlations in composite quantum systems and to estimate the degree of non-Markovianity of an analyzed quantum dynamics. Other applications include the problem of unistochasticity of a given bistochastic matrix, with relevance for quantization of classical dynamics and studies of violation of CP-symmetry in high energy physics. In all these cases, the non-linear witnesses introduced here outperform the standard linear witnesses. Importance of our findings for quantum information theory is also emphasized.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. classical $P$-divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $P$-divisibility is a central concept in both classical and quantum non-Markovian processes; in particular, it is strictly related to the notion of information backflow. When restricted to a fixed commutative algebra generated by a complete set of orthogonal projections, any quantum dynamics naturally provides a classical stochastic process. It is indeed well known that a quantum generator gives rise to a $P$-divisible quantum dynamics if and only if all its possible classical reductions give rise to divisible classical stochastic processes. Yet, this property does not hold if one classically reduces the quantum dynamical maps instead of their generators: for a unitary dynamics, as an example, $P$-divisibility of its classical reduction is inevitably lost, which is thus, non-Markovian and exhibits information backflow. Instead, for some important classes of purely dissipative evolutions, quantum $P$-divisibility always implies classical $P$-divisibility and thus lack of information backflow both in the quantum and classical scenarios. On the contrary, for a wide class of orthogonally covariant qubit dynamics, we show that loss of classical $P$-divisibility can originate from the classical reduction of a purely dissipative $P$-divisible quantum dynamics as in the unitary case. Moreover, such an effect can be interpreted in terms of information backflow, the information coming in being stored in the coherences of the time-evolving quantum state.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of time dependent electromagnetic fields with single electron excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the potential of electronic interferometers for probing the quantum state of electromagnetic radiation on a chip at sub-nanosecond time scales. We propose to use single electron excitations propagating within an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the Aharonov-Bohm dominated regime. We discuss how information about the quantum state of the electromagnetic radiation is encoded into the interference contribution to the average outgoing electrical current. By investigating squeezed radiation and single edge magnetoplasmons probed by Leviton pulses in a realistic setup, we show that single electron interferometers have the potential to probe quantum radiation in the time domain with sub-nanosecond to pico-second time resolution. Our research could have significant implications for probing the fundamental properties of light in the microwave to tera-Hertz domains at extremely short time scales.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Verification of Quantum Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-checking techniques have been extended to analyze quantum programs and communication protocols represented as quantum Markov chains, an extension of classical Markov chains. To specify qualitative temporal properties, a subspace-based quantum temporal logic is used, which is built on Birkhoff-von Neumann atomic propositions. These propositions determine whether a quantum state is within a subspace of the entire state space. In this paper, we propose the measurement-based linear-time temporal logic MLTL to check quantitative properties. MLTL builds upon classical linear-time temporal logic (LTL) but introduces quantum atomic propositions that reason about the probability distribution after measuring a quantum state. To facilitate verification, we extend the symbolic dynamics-based techniques for stochastic matrices described by Agrawal et al. (JACM 2015) to handle more general quantum linear operators (super-operators) through eigenvalue analysis. This extension enables the development of an efficient algorithm for approximately model checking a quantum Markov chain against an MLTL formula. To demonstrate the utility of our model-checking algorithm, we use it to simultaneously verify linear-time properties of both quantum and classical random walks. Through this verification, we confirm the previously established advantages discovered by Ambainis et al. (STOC 2001) of quantum walks over classical random walks and discover new phenomena unique to quantum walks.</description>

Abstract: In 1989, Eberhard proposed a v-causal model where quantum correlations between entangled particles are established by communications moving at a superluminal speed v_t &gt; c in a preferred frame. In successive years, several experiments established lower bounds for the possible tachyons velocities. In a recent paper, Luigi Santamaria Amato et al. performed an interesting east-west aligned tabletop experiment under the assumption that the preferred frame is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). In that paper, they criticize long-distance experiments but here we show that most of their criticisms are not applicable to long-distance tunnel experiments where the highest lower bound was obtained.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Approach to Minimising Gate and Qubit Teleportations for Multi-Processor Quantum Circuit Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) provides a means for scaling available quantum computation by interconnecting multiple quantum processor units (QPUs). A key challenge in this domain is efficiently allocating logical qubits from quantum circuits to the physical qubits within QPUs, a task known to be NP-hard. Traditional approaches, primarily focused on graph partitioning strategies, have sought to reduce the number of required Bell pairs for executing non-local CNOT operations, a form of gate teleportation. However, these methods have limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. Addressing this, our work jointly considers gate and qubit teleportations introducing a novel meta-heuristic algorithm to minimise the network cost of executing a quantum circuit. By allowing dynamic reallocation of qubits along with gate teleportations during circuit execution, our method significantly enhances the overall efficacy and potential scalability of DQC frameworks. In our numerical analysis, we demonstrate that integrating qubit teleportations into our genetic algorithm for optimising circuit blocking reduces the required resources, specifically the number of EPR pairs, compared to traditional graph partitioning methods. Our results, derived from both benchmark and randomly generated circuits, show that as circuit complexity increases - demanding more qubit teleportations - our approach effectively optimises these teleportations throughout the execution, thereby enhancing performance through strategic circuit partitioning. This is a step forward in the pursuit of a global quantum compiler which will ultimately enable the efficient use of a 'quantum data center' in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement enables single-shot trajectory sensing for weakly interacting particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensors for mapping the trajectory of an incoming particle find important utility in experimental high energy physics and searches for dark matter. For a quantum sensing protocol that uses projective measurements on a multi-qubit sensor array to infer the trajectory of an incident particle, we show that entanglement can dramatically reduce the particle-sensor interaction strength $\theta$ required for perfect trajectory discrimination. Within an interval of $\theta$ above this reduced threshold, any unentangled sensor requires $\Theta(\log(1/\epsilon))$ repetitions of the protocol to estimate the particle trajectory with $\epsilon$ error probability, whereas an entangled sensor can succeed with zero error in a single shot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits are one of the promising ways to exploit the advantages of quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology era. The design of the quantum circuit architecture might greatly affect the performance capability of the quantum algorithms. The quantum architecture search is the process of automatically designing quantum circuit architecture, aiming at finding the optimal quantum circuit composition architecture by the algorithm for a given task, so that the algorithm can learn to design the circuit architecture. Compared to manual design, quantum architecture search algorithms are more effective in finding quantum circuits with better performance capabilities. In this paper, based on the deep reinforcement learning, we propose an approach for quantum circuit architecture search. The sampling of the circuit architecture is learnt through reinforcement learning based controller. Layer-based search is also used to accelerate the computational efficiency of the search algorithm. Applying to data classification tasks we show that the method can search for quantum circuit architectures with better accuracies. Moreover, the circuit has a smaller number of quantum gates and parameters.</description>

      <title>Generalized R\'enyi entropy accumulation theorem and generalized quantum probability estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropy accumulation theorem, and its subsequent generalized version, is a powerful tool in the security analysis of many device-dependent and device-independent cryptography protocols. However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which can often be challenging to construct optimally in practice. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as an intuitively interpretable convex optimization, without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of R\'enyi entropies if desired, yielding fully-R\'enyi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the frameworks of quantum probability estimation or $f$-weighted R\'enyi entropies, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to those frameworks as well.</description>

      <title>Motion from Measurement: The Role of Symmetry of Quantum Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, measurements are dynamical processes and thus they should be capable of inducing currents. The symmetries of the Hamiltonian and measurement operator provide an organizing principle for understanding the conditions for such currents to emerge. The central role is played by the inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We classify the distinct behaviors that emerge from single and repeated measurements, with and without coupling to a dissipative bath. While the breaking of inversion symmetry alone is sufficient to generate currents through measurements, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the measurement operator leads to a dramatic increase in the magnitude of the currents. We consider the dependence on the measurement rate and find that the current is non-monotonic. Furthermore, nondegenerate measurements can lead to current loops within the steady state even in the Zeno limit.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain pure-state symmetry-protected topological orders (SPT) can be used as a resource for transmitting quantum information. Here, we investigate the ability to transmit quantum information using decohered SPT states, and relate this property to the "strange correlation functions" which diagnose quantum many-body orders in these mixed-states. This perspective leads to the identification of a class of quantum channels -- termed symmetry-decoupling channels -- which do not necessarily preserve any weak or strong symmetries of the SPT state, but nevertheless protect quantum many-body order in the decohered mixed-state. We quantify the ability to transmit quantum information in decohered SPT states through the coherent quantum information, whose behavior is generally related to a decoding problem, whereby local measurements in the system are used to attempt to "learn" the symmetry charge of the SPT state before decoherence.</description>

Abstract: Higher Berry curvature (HBC) is the proposed generalization of Berry curvature to infinitely extended systems. Heuristically HBC captures the flow of local Berry curvature in a system. Here we provide a simple formula for computing the HBC for extended $d = 1$ systems at the level of wave functions using the Schmidt decomposition. We also find a corresponding formula for matrix product states (MPS), and show that for translationally invariant MPS this gives rise to a quantized invariant. We demonstrate our approach with an exactly solvable model and numerical calculations for generic models using iDMRG</description>

      <title>Nodal Spectral Functions Stabilized by Non-Hermitian Topology of Quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum materials, basic observables such as spectral functions and susceptibilities are determined by Green's functions and their complex quasiparticle spectrum rather than by bare electrons. Even in closed many-body systems, this makes a description in terms of effective non-Hermitian (NH) Bloch Hamiltonians natural and intuitive. Here, we discuss how the abundance and stability of nodal phases is drastically affected by NH topology. While previous work has mostly considered complex degeneracies known as exceptional points as the NH counterpart of nodal points, we propose to relax this assumption by only requiring a crossing of the real part of the complex quasiparticle spectra, which entails a band crossing in the spectral function, i.e. a nodal spectral function. Interestingly, such real crossings are topologically protected by the braiding properties of the complex Bloch bands, and thus generically occur already in one-dimensional systems without symmetry or fine-tuning. We propose and study a microscopic lattice model in which a sublattice-dependent interaction stabilizes nodal spectral functions. Besides the gapless spectrum, we identify non-reciprocal charge transport properties after a local potential quench as a key signature of non-trivial band braiding. Finally, in the limit of zero interaction on one of the sublattices, we find a perfectly ballistic unidirectional mode in a non-integrable environment, reminiscent of a chiral edge state known from quantum Hall phases. Our analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations both in the framework of exact diagonalization and within the conserving second Born approximation.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Curvature from the Wave function II: Locally Parameterized States Beyond One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a systematic wave function based approach to construct topological invariants for families of lattice systems that are short-range entangled using local parameter spaces. This construction is particularly suitable when given a family of tensor networks that can be viewed as the ground states of $d$ dimensional lattice systems, for which we construct the closed $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature, which is a generalization of the well known 2-form Berry curvature. Such $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature characterizes a flow of $(d+1)$-form higher Berry curvature in the system. Our construction is equally suitable for constructing other higher pumps, such as the (higher) Thouless pump in the presence of a global on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which corresponds to a closed $d$-form. The cohomology classes of such higher differential forms are topological invariants and are expected to be quantized for short-range entangled states. We illustrate our construction with exactly solvable lattice models that are in nontrivial higher Berry classes in $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Phase from Projected Entangled Pair States in (2+1) dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider families of invertible many-body quantum states in $d$ spatial dimensions that are parameterized over some parameter space $X$. The space of such families is expected to have topologically distinct sectors classified by the cohomology group $\mathrm{H}^{d+2}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. These topological sectors are distinguished by a topological invariant built from a generalization of the Berry phase, called the higher Berry phase. In the previous work, we introduced a generalized inner product for three one-dimensional many-body quantum states, (``triple inner product''). The higher Berry phase for one-dimensional invertible states can be introduced through the triple inner product and furthermore the topological invariant, which takes its value in $\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$, can be extracted. In this paper, we introduce an inner product of four two-dimensional invertible quantum many-body states. We use it to measure the topological nontriviality of parameterized families of 2d invertible states. In particular, we define a topological invariant of such families that takes values in $\mathrm{H}^{4}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. Our formalism uses projected entangled pair states (PEPS). We also construct a specific example of non-trivial parameterized families of 2d invertible states parameterized over $\mathbb{R}P^4$ and demonstrate the use of our formula. Applications for symmetry-protected topological phases are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In one spatial dimension, families of short-range entangled many-body quantum states, parameterized over some parameter space, can be topologically distinguished and classified by topological invariants built from the higher Berry phase -- a many-body generalization of the Berry phase. Previous works identified the underlying mathematical structure (the gerbe structure) and introduced a multi-wavefunction overlap, a generalization of the inner product in quantum mechanics, which allows for the extraction of the higher Berry phase and topological invariants. In this paper, building on these works, we introduce a connection, the higher Berry connection, for a family of parameterized Matrix Product States (MPS) over a parameter space. We demonstrate the use of our formula for simple non-trivial models.</description>

      <title>Unbiasing Fermionic Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo with Matrix Product State Trial Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report, for the first time, an implementation of fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) using matrix product state (MPS) trial wavefunctions, dubbed MPS-AFQMC. Calculating overlaps between an MPS trial and arbitrary Slater determinants up to a multiplicative error, a crucial subroutine in MPS-AFQMC, is proven to be #P-hard. Nonetheless, we tested several promising heuristics in successfully improving fermionic phaseless AFQMC energies. We also proposed a way to evaluate local energy and force bias evaluations free of matrix-product operators. This allows for larger basis set calculations without significant overhead. We showcase the utility of our approach on one- and two-dimensional hydrogen lattices, even when the MPS trial itself struggles to obtain high accuracy. Our work offers a new set of tools that can solve currently challenging electronic structure problems with future improvements.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It makes a unified description to the HOTPs caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can also be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the HOTPs in momentum space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum science is in the news daily and engages student interest and curiosity. A fundamental quantum science concept that underpins medical imaging, quantum computing and many future technologies is quantum spin. Quantum spin can explain many physical phenomena that are in the lower secondary school curriculum, such as magnetism and light, making its inclusion a great motivator for students. Here we present an activity sequence for teaching quantum spin in the classroom using spinning tops and gyroscopes to highlight the common properties of classical angular momentum and quantum spin. These toys can provide an easily understood window to the quantum world for lower secondary school students. Students who have engaged in these activities reported enjoying the content and appreciating its relevance.</description>

      <title>Twisting factors and fixed-time models in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of fixed-time models in which the commutations relations of a Dirac field with a bosonic field are non-trivial and depend on the choice of a given distribution ("twisting factor"). If the twisting factor is fundamental solution of a differential operator, then applying the differential operator to the bosonic field yields a generator of the local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. Charged vectors generated by the Dirac field define states of the bosonic field which in general are not local excitations of the given reference state. The Hamiltonian density of the bosonic field presents a non-trivial interaction term: besides creating and annihilating bosons, it acts on momenta of fermionic wave functions. When the twisting factor is the Coulomb potential, the bosonic field contributes to the divergence of an electric field and its Laplacian generates local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. In this way we get a fixed-time model fulfilling the equal time commutation relations of the interacting Coulomb gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike charge, heat flows are difficult to control. We show that, in mesoscopic conductors, electronic thermal currents can be manipulated with a magnetic field by using the Aharonov-Bohm effect: the magnetic control of the interference pattern enhances the thermoelectric effect, while heat transport can be totally suppressed. In a three-terminal configuration, the flux-induced broken reciprocity generates a non-local thermoelectric response and translates to the circulation of heat. This way, efficient thermoelectric generators, thermal switches and thermal circulators, as well as energy harvesters can be defined for minimally disturbing thermal management at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Self-correcting GKP qubit and gates in a driven-dissipative circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a circuit architecture for a dissipatively error-corrected GKP qubit. The device consists of a high-impedance LC circuit coupled to a Josephson junction and a resistor via a controllable switch. When the switch is activated via a particular family of stepwise protocols, the resistor absorbs all noise-induced entropy, resulting in dissipative error correction of both phase and amplitude errors. This leads to an exponential increase of qubit lifetime, reaching beyond 10ms in simulations with near-feasible parameters. We show that the lifetime remains exponentially long in the presence of extrinsic noise and device/control imperfections (e.g., due to parasitics and finite control bandwidth) under specific thresholds. In this regime, lifetime is likely only limited by phase slips and quasiparticle tunneling. We show that the qubit can be read out and initialized via measurement of the supercurrent in the Josephson junction. We finally show that the qubit supports native self-correcting single-qubit Clifford gates, where dissipative error-correction of control noise leads to exponential suppression of gate infidelity.</description>

      <title>Intermediate spectral statistics of rational triangular quantum billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triangular billiards whose angles are rational multiples of $\pi$ are one of the simplest examples of pseudo-integrable models with intriguing classical and quantum properties. We perform an extensive numerical study of spectral statistics of eight quantized rational triangles, six belonging to the family of right-angled Veech triangles and two obtuse rational triangles. Large spectral samples of up to one million energy levels were calculated for each triangle which permits to determine their spectral statistics with great accuracy. It is demonstrated that they are of the intermediate type, sharing some features with chaotic systems, like level repulsion and some with integrable systems, like exponential tails of the level spacing distributions. Another distinctive feature of intermediate spectral statistics is a finite value of the level compressibility.
  The short range statistics such as the level spacing distributions, and long-range statistics such as the number variance and spectral form factors were analyzed in detail. An excellent agreement between the numerical data and the model of gamma distributions is revealed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11840v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the impending timeline of developing good-quality quantum processing units, it is time to rethink the approach to advance quantum computing research. Rather than waiting for quantum hardware technologies to mature, we need to start assessing in tandem the impact of the occurrence of quantum computing, or rather Quantum Computing Logic (QC-Logic), on various scientific fields. This is where the subtitle comes from. A new scientific revolution is unfolding. In making real scientific progress, we need to use an additional and complementary approach, which the NISQ program or any follow-up approach does not propose. We must be aware that defining, implementing, and testing quantum concepts in any field is tremendous work. The main reason is that QC initiates an overall revolution in all scientific fields, and how those machines will be used in daily life is a very big challenge. That is why we propose a complete update of the first PISQ paper. We still advocate the additional PISQ approach: Perfect Intermediate-Scale Quantum computing based on a well-established concept of perfect qubits. We expand the quantum road map with (N)FTQC, which stands for (Non) Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing. This will allow researchers to focus exclusively on developing new applications by defining the algorithms in terms of perfect qubits and evaluating them in two ways. Either executed on quantum computing simulators executed on supercomputers or hardware-based qubit chips. This approach will be explained in this paper. Our planet needs a long-term vision and solution. It will enable universities and companies alike to accelerate the development of new quantum algorithms, build the necessary know-how, and thus address one of the key bottlenecks within the quantum industry: the lack of talent to develop well-tested quantum applications.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by quantum network applications over classical channels, we initiate the study of $n$-party resource states from which LOCC protocols can create EPR-pairs between any $k$ disjoint pairs of parties. We give constructions of such states where $k$ is not too far from the optimal $n/2$ while the individual parties need to hold only a constant number of qubits. In the special case when each party holds only one qubit, we describe a family of $n$-qubit states with $k$ proportional to $\log n$ based on Reed-Muller codes, as well as small numerically found examples for $k=2$ and $k=3$. We also prove some lower bounds, for example showing that if $k=n/2$ then the parties must have at least $\Omega(\log\log n)$ qubits each.</description>

      <title>Kerr-effect-based quantum logical gates in decoherence-free subspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05625v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decoherence effect caused by the coupling between the system and the environment undoubtedly leads to the errors in efficient implementations of two (or three) qubit logical gates in quantum information processing. Fortunately, decoherence-free subspace (DFS) introduced can effectively decrease the influence of decoherence effect. In this paper, we propose some schemes for setting up a family of quantum control gates, including controlled-NOT (CNOT), Toffoli, and Fredkin gates for two or three logical qubits by means of cross-Kerr nonlinearities in DFS. These three logical gates require neither complicated quantum computational circuits nor auxiliary photons (or entangled states). The success probabilities of three logical gates are approximate 1 by performing the corresponding classical feed-forward operations based on the different measuring results of the X-homodyne detectors, and their fidelities are robust against the photon loss with the current technology. The proposed logical gates rely on only simple linear-optics elements, available single-qubit operations, and mature measurement methods, making our proposed gates be feasible and efficient in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that a periodically driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with imbalanced on-site gain/loss supports universal one-way transport that is immune to impurities and independent of initial excitations. We reveal the underlying mechanism that the periodic driving gives rise to the non-Hermitian skin effect in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, thereby causing universal non-reciprocal transport. Additionally, we probe the time-average decay rate of the propagator under long-time bulk dynamics as a signature of the Floquet emergent non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results provide a feasible and controllable way to realize universal one-way transport that is easily accessible to experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variational quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm is efficient in finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. This algorithm involves solving a system of linear equations in a classical computer and the solution is then used to propagate a quantum wavefunction. Here, we show that owing to the noisy nature of current quantum processors, such a quantum algorithm or the family of quantum algorithms will require single- and two-qubit gates with very low error probability to produce reliable results. Failure to meet such condition will result in erroneous quantum data propagation even for a relatively small quantum circuit ansatz. Specifically, we provide the upper bounds on how the relative error in variational parameters' propagation scales with the probability of noise in quantum hardware. We also present an exact expression of how the relative error in variational parameter propagation scales with the probability of partially depolarizing noise.</description>

Abstract: Transitions out of the ground space limit the performance of quantum adiabatic algorithms, while hardware imperfections impose stringent limitations on the circuit depth. We propose an adiabatic echo verification protocol which mitigates both coherent and incoherent errors, arising from non-adiabatic transitions and hardware noise, respectively. Quasi-adiabatically evolving forward and backwards allows for an echo-verified measurement of any observable. In addition to mitigating hardware noise, our method uses positive-time dynamics only. Crucially, the estimator bias of the observable is reduced when compared to standard adiabatic preparation, achieving up to a quadratic improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decoherence of point defect qubits is often governed by the electron spin-nuclear spin hyperfine interaction that can be parameterized by using ab inito calculations in principle. So far most of the theoretical works have focused on the hyperfine interaction of the closest nuclear spins, while the accuracy of the predictions for distinct nuclear spins is barely discussed. We demonstrate for the case of the NV center in diamond that the absolute relative error of the computed hyperfine parameters can exceed 100\% in VASP for weakly coupled nuclear spins. To overcome this issue, we implement an alternative method and report on significantly improved hyperfine values with $O$(1\%) relative mean error at all distances. The provided accurate hyperfine data for the NV center enables high-precision simulation of NV quantum nodes for quantum information processing and positioning of nuclear spins by comparing experimental and theoretical hyperfine data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we design the first semiquantum private comparison (SQPC) protocol which is realized via cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) by making use of the evolution law of atom. With the help of a semi-honest third party (TP), the proposed protocol can compare the equality of private inputs from two semiquantum parties who only have limited quantum capabilities. The proposed protocol uses product states as initial quantum resource and employs none of unitary operations, quantum entanglement swapping operation or delay lines. Security proof turns out that it can defeat both the external attack and the internal attack.</description>

Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected squeezed (PS) states are multipartite entangled states generated by unitary spin squeezing, followed by a collective quantum measurement and post-selection. They can lead to an appreciable decrease in the state preparation time of the maximally entangled N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state when compared to deterministic preparation by unitary transformations in physical systems where spin squeezing can be realized, such as ion, neutral atom, and superconducting qubits. Here we simulate the generation of PS states in non-ideal experimental conditions with relevant decoherence channels. By employing the Kraus operator method, and quantum trajectory method to reduce the computational complexity, we assess the quantum Fisher information and overlap fidelity with an ideal GHZ state. Our findings highlight PS states as useful metrological resources, demonstrating a robustness against environmental effects with increasing qubit number N.</description>

Abstract: We develop a version of quantum mechanics that can handle nonassociative algebras of observables and which reduces to standard quantum theory in the traditional associative setting. Our algebraic approach is naturally probabilistic and is based on using the universal enveloping algebra of a general nonassociative algebra to introduce a generalized notion of associative composition product. We formulate properties of states together with notions of trace, and use them to develop GNS constructions. We describe Heisenberg and Schr\"odinger pictures of completely positive dynamics, and we illustrate our formalism on the explicit examples of finite-dimensional matrix Jordan algebras as well as the octonion algebra.</description>

      <title>Magic in generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic is a property of a quantum state that characterizes its deviation from a stabilizer state, serving as a useful resource for achieving universal quantum computation e.g., within schemes that use Clifford operations. In this work, we study magic, as quantified by the stabilizer Renyi entropy, in a class of models known as generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson systems, i.e., Hamiltonians that allow a stochastic matrix form (SMF) decomposition. The ground state wavefunctions of these systems can be written explicitly throughout their phase diagram, and their properties can be related to associated classical statistical mechanics problems, thereby allowing powerful analytical and numerical approaches that are not usually available in conventional quantum many body settings. As a result, we are able to express the SRE in terms of wave function coefficients that can be understood as a free energy difference of related classical problems. We apply this insight to a range of quantum many body SMF Hamiltonians, which affords us to study numerically the SRE of large high-dimensional systems, and in some cases to obtain analytical results. We observe that the behaviour of the SRE is relatively featureless across quantum phase transitions in these systems, although it is indeed singular (in its first or higher order derivative, depending on the nature of the transition). On the contrary, we find that the maximum of the SRE generically occurs at a cusp away from the quantum critical point, where the derivative suddenly changes sign. Furthermore, we compare the SRE and the logarithm of overlaps with specific stabilizer states, asymptotically realised in the ground state phase diagrams of these systems. We find that they display strikingly similar behaviors, which in turn establish rigorous bounds on the min-relative entropy of magic.</description>

      <title>Updating Bohr's Complementarity Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bohr's complementarity principle has long been a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, positing that, within a given experimental setup, a quantum system (or quanton) can exhibit either its wave-like character, denoted as $W$, or its particle-like character, denoted as $P$, but not both simultaneously. Modern interpretations of Bohr's complementarity principle acknowledge the coexistence of these aspects in the same experiment while introducing the constraint $W + P \le \alpha$. Notably, estimations of $W$ or $P$ frequently rely on indirect retrodiction methods, a practice that has led to the claim of the violation of Bohr's complementarity principle. By taking a different route, recent advancements demonstrate that complementarity relations can be rigorously derived from the axioms of quantum mechanics under specific quantum state preparation conditions. To reconcile these observations and eliminate potential paradoxes or violations, we propose an updated formulation of Bohr's complementarity principle, which is stated as follows: \textit{For a given quantum state preparation $\rho_t$ at a specific instant of time $t$, the wave and particle behaviors of a quanton are constrained by a complementarity relation $W(\rho_t) + P(\rho_t) \le \alpha(d)$, which is derived directly from the axioms of quantum mechanics.}</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Quantum Circuit Optimization via ZX-Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for optimizing quantum circuits using graph-theoretic simplification rules of ZX-diagrams. The agent, trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, employs Graph Neural Networks to approximate the policy and value functions. We demonstrate the capacity of our approach by comparing it against the best performing ZX-calculus-based algorithm for the problem in hand. After training on small Clifford+T circuits of 5-qubits and few tenths of gates, the agent consistently improves the state-of-the-art for this type of circuits, with up to 40-qubit and 1200 gates, whilst remaining competitive in terms of computational performance. Additionally, we illustrate its versatility by targeting both total and two-qubit gate count reduction, conveying the potential of tailoring its reward function to the specific characteristics of each hardware backend. Our approach is ready to be used as a valuable tool for the implementation of quantum algorithms in the near-term intermediate-scale range (NISQ).</description>

      <title>Accuracy vs Memory Advantage in the Quantum Simulation of Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many inference scenarios rely on extracting relevant information from known data in order to make future predictions. When the underlying stochastic process satisfies certain assumptions, there is a direct mapping between its exact classical and quantum simulators, with the latter asymptotically using less memory. Here we focus on studying whether such quantum advantage persists when those assumptions are not satisfied, and the model is doomed to have imperfect accuracy. By studying the trade-off between accuracy and memory requirements, we show that quantum models can reach the same accuracy with less memory, or alternatively, better accuracy with the same memory. Finally, we discuss the implications of this result for learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Two-Unitary Complex Hadamard Matrices of Order $36$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of two-unitary complex Hadamard matrices (CHM) stemming from a particular matrix, of size $36$ is constructed. Every matrix in this orbit remains unitary after operations of partial transpose and reshuffling which makes it a distinguished subset of CHM. It provides a novel solution to the quantum version of the Euler problem, in which each field of the Graeco-Latin square of size six contains a symmetric superposition of all $36$ officers with phases being multiples of sixth root of unity. This simplifies previously known solutions as all amplitudes of the superposition are equal and the set of phases consists of $6$ elements only. Multidimensional parameterization allows for more flexibility in a potential experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Exact Homomorphic Encryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the concept of fault tolerance quantum computation, this article proposes a framework dubbed Exact Homomorphic Encryption, EHE, enabling exact computations on encrypted data without the need for pre-decryption. The introduction of quantum gates is a critical step for constructing the message encryption and the computation encryption within the framework. Of significance is that both encryptions are respectively accomplished in a multivariate polynomial set generated by quantum gates. Two fundamental traits of quantum gates, the invertibility and the noncommutativity, establish the success of EHE. The encrypted computation is exact because its encryption transformation is conducted with invertible gates. In the same vein, decryptions for both an encrypted message and encrypted computation are exact. The second trait of noncommutativity among applied quantum gates brings forth the security for the two encryptions. Toward the message encryption, a plaintext is encoded into a ciphertext via a polynomial set generated by a product of noncommuting gates randomly chosen. In the computation encryption, a desired operation is encoded into an encrypted polynomial set generated by another product of noncommuting gates. The encrypted computation is then the evaluation of the encrypted polynomial set on the ciphertext and is referred to as the cryptovaluation. EHE is not only attainable on quantum computers, but also straightforwardly realizable on traditional computing environments. Surpassing the standard security 2^128 of quantum resilience, both the encryptions further reach a security greater than the suggested threshold 2^1024 and are characterized as hyper quantum-resilient. Thanks to the two essential traits of quantum gates, this framework can be regarded as the initial tangible manifestation of the concept noncommutative cryptography.</description>

Abstract: We present an expression for the spectral gap, opening up new possibilities for performing and accelerating spectral calculations of quantum many-body systems. We develop and demonstrate one such possibility in the context of tensor network simulations. Our approach requires only minor modifications of the widely used simple update method and is computationally lightweight relative to other approaches. We validate it by computing spectral gaps of the 2D and 3D transverse-field Ising models and find strong agreement with previously reported perturbation theory results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems undergo decoherence, which is responsible for the transition from quantum to classical behavior. The time scale in which decoherence takes place can be analyzed using upper limits to its rate. We examine the dynamics of open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindblad operators sourced from Gaussian and Ginibre ensembles with Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In these systems, the ensemble-averaged purity decays monotonically as a function of time. This decay is governed by the decoherence rate, which is upper-bounded by the dimension of their Hilbert space and is independent of the ensemble symmetry. These findings hold upon mixing different ensembles, indicating the universal character of the decoherence rate limit. Moreover, our findings reveal that open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindbladians tend to exhibit the most rapid decoherence, regardless of the initial state. This phenomenon is associated with the concentration of the decoherence rate near its upper bound. Our work identifies primary features of decoherence in dissipative quantum chaos, with applications ranging from quantum foundations to high-energy physics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired classical algorithms provide us with a new way to understand the computational power of quantum computers for practically-relevant problems, especially in machine learning. In the past several years, numerous efficient algorithms for various tasks have been found, while an analysis of lower bounds is still missing. Using communication complexity, in this work we propose the first method to study lower bounds for these tasks. We mainly focus on lower bounds for solving linear regressions, supervised clustering, principal component analysis, recommendation systems, and Hamiltonian simulations. For those problems, we prove a quadratic lower bound in terms of the Frobenius norm of the underlying matrix. As quantum algorithms are linear in the Frobenius norm for those problems, our results mean that the quantum-classical separation is at least quadratic. As a generalisation, we extend our method to study lower bounds analysis of quantum query algorithms for matrix-related problems using quantum communication complexity. Some applications are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of logical quantum processors signifies a pivotal moment in the progression from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. These advanced devices are poised to alter the approach to problems that challenge classical computation methods. By transforming such problems into Hamiltonian frameworks and exploiting quantum mechanical properties, these processors have the potential to address complex issues within a polynomial computational time. However, despite their advancements, these processors remain vulnerable to disruptive noise, highlighting the need for robust quantum algorithms designed to manage noise effectively. In response to this need, we introduce a new classical-quantum hybrid algorithm termed Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo (QZMC). QZMC is capable of handling device noises and Trotter errors while demonstrating polynomial computational cost. This algorithm combines the quantum Zeno effect with Monte Carlo integration techniques, facilitating multi-step transitions toward targeted eigenstates of the Hamiltonian problem. Notably, QZMC does not require overlap between the initial state and the target state, nor does it depend on variational parameters. It can compute static and dynamic properties of the targeted states, including ground state energy, excited state energies, and Green's functions. Compared to quantum phase estimation, QZMC offers a significantly reduced quantum circuit depth. These features make QZMC an important algorithm for navigating the current transitional phase in quantum computing and beyond.</description>

Abstract: We propose a chirped-pulse driving protocol and reveal its exceptional property for quantum coherent control. The nonadiabatic passage generated by the driving protocol, which includes the population inversion and the nonadiabaticity-induced transition as its ingredients, is shown to be robust against pulse truncation. We further demonstrate that the protocol allows for universal manipulation on the qubit system through designing pulse sequences with either properly adjusted sweeping frequency or pulsing intensity.</description>

Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and $q=4$ (quartic interactions) which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k\ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms times 1/$N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{3/2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{6}$ gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model and simulate real-time dynamics up to scrambling time.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers to find optimal controls. This paper explores how to correctly apply the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. Our findings significantly reevaluate the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We derived the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. We demonstrated that the derived diffusion coefficient took a form that allowed the HJB equation to be linearized, thereby leading to the derivation of the Dirac equations. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the mathematical rigor of the framework for applying stochastic optimal control to quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical response functions are fundamental quantities to describe the excited-state properties in quantum many-body systems. Quantum algorithms have been proposed to evaluate these quantities by means of quantum phase estimation (QPE), where the energy spectra are directly extracted from the QPE measurement outcomes in the frequency domain. Accurate estimation of excitation energies and transition probabilities with these QPE-based approaches is, however, challenging because of the problem of spectral leakage (or peak broadening) which is inherent in the QPE algorithm. To overcome this issue, in this work we consider an extension of the QPE-based approach adopting the optimal entangled input states, which is known to achieve the Heisenberg-limited scaling for the estimation precision. We show that with this method the peaks in the calculated energy spectra are more localized than those calculated by the original QPE-based approaches, suggesting the mitigation of the spectral leakage problem. By analyzing the probability distribution with the entangled phase estimation, we propose a simple scheme to better estimate both the transition energies and the corresponding transition probabilities of the peaks of interest in the spectra. The validity of our prescription is demonstrated by numerical simulations in various quantum many-body problems: the spectral function of a simple electron-plasmon model in condensed-matter physics, the dipole transitions of the H$_2$O molecule in quantum chemistry, and the electromagnetic transitions of the $^6$Li nucleus in nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) with an emphasis on the computational advancements enabled by NVIDIA's cuQuantum SDK, especially leveraging the cuTensorNet library. We present a simulation workflow that substantially diminishes computational overhead, as evidenced by our experiments, from exponential to quadratic cost. While state vector simulations become infeasible for qubit counts over 50, our evaluation demonstrates that cuTensorNet speeds up simulations to be completed within seconds on the NVIDIA A100 GPU, even for qubit counts approaching 784. By employing multi-GPU processing with Message Passing Interface (MPI), we document a marked decrease in computation times, effectively demonstrating the strong linear speedup of our approach for increasing data sizes. This enables QSVMs to operate efficiently on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, thereby opening a new window for researchers to explore complex quantum algorithms that have not yet been investigated. In accuracy assessments, our QSVM achieves up to 95\% on challenging classifications within the MNIST dataset for training sets larger than 100 instances, surpassing the capabilities of classical SVMs. These advancements position cuTensorNet within the cuQuantum SDK as a pivotal tool for scaling quantum machine learning simulations and potentially signpost the seamless integration of such computational strategies as pivotal within the Quantum-HPC ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quantum geometry from exponential corrections to the black hole entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 (2020) 041302] that microstate counting carried out for quantum states residing on the horizon of a black hole leads to a correction of the form $\exp(-A/4l_p^2)$ in the Bekenstein-Hawking form of the black hole entropy. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to obtain the possible form of the spacetime geometry from the entropy of the black hole for a given horizon radius. The uniqueness of this solution for a given energy-momentum tensor has also been discussed. Remarkably, the black hole geometry reconstructed has striking similarities to that of noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black holes [Phys. Lett. B 632 (2006) 547]. We also obtain the matter density functions using Einstein field equations for the geometries we reconstruct from the thermodynamics of black holes. These also have similarities to that of the matter density function of a noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The conformal structure of the metric is briefly discussed and the Penrose-Carter diagram is drawn. We then compute the Komar energy and the Smarr formula for the effective black hole geometry and compare it with that of the noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. We also discuss some astrophysical implications of the solutions. Finally, we propose a set of quantum Einstein vacuum field equations, as a solution of which we obtain one of the spacetime solutions obtained in this work. We then show a direct connection between the quantum Einstein vacuum field equations and the first law of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Breaking and resurgence of symmetry in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in photonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the cornerstones of modern physics and has profound implications in different areas. In symmetry-protected topological systems, symmetries are responsible for protecting surface states, which are at the heart of the fascinating properties exhibited by these materials. When the symmetry protecting the edge mode is broken, the topological phase becomes trivial. By engineering losses that break the symmetry protecting a topological Hermitian phase, we show that a new genuinely non-Hermitian symmetry emerges, which protects and selects one of the boundary modes: the topological monomode. Moreover, the topology of the non-Hermitian system can be characterized by an effective Hermitian Hamiltonian in a higher dimension. To corroborate the theory, we experimentally investigated the non-Hermitian 1D and 2D SSH models using photonic lattices and observed dynamically generated monomodes in both cases. We classify the systems in terms of the (non-Hermitian) symmetries that are present and calculate the corresponding topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Analysis of the Anderson Model on Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a renormalization group analysis of the problem of Anderson localization on a Random Regular Graph (RRG) which generalizes the renormalization group of Abrahams, Anderson, Licciardello, and Ramakrishnan to infinite-dimensional graphs. The renormalization group equations necessarily involve two parameters (one being the changing connectivity of sub-trees), but we show that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis is recovered for sufficiently large system sizes for both eigenstates and spectrum observables. We also explain the non-monotonic behavior of dynamical and spectral quantities as a function of the system size for values of disorder close to the transition, by identifying two terms in the beta function of the running fractal dimension of different signs and functional dependence. Our theory provides a simple and coherent explanation for the unusual scaling behavior observed in numerical data of the Anderson model on RRG and of Many-Body Localization.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Mobility Edge in Quantum Sun models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum sun model is an interacting model that exhibits sharp signatures of ergodicity breaking phase transition. Here, we show that the model exhibits a many-body mobility edge. We provide analytical arguments for its existence, complemented by the state-of-the-art numerical simulations analysing gap ratios, Thouless times as well as entanglement entropy of eigenstates. We also introduce the quantum sun model with particle number conservation, and we argue that it shares many similarities with his unrestricted predecessor.</description>

      <title>Quantum Classical Algorithm for the Study of Phase Transitions in the Hubbard Model via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems is believed to be one of the most promising applications of near-term noisy quantum computers. However, in the near term, system size limitation will remain a severe barrier for applications in materials science or strongly correlated systems. A promising avenue of research is to combine many-body physics with machine learning for the classification of distinct phases. In this paper, we propose a workflow that synergizes quantum computing, many-body theory, and quantum machine learning(QML) for studying strongly correlated systems. In particular, it can capture a putative quantum phase transition of the stereotypical strongly correlated system, the Hubbard model. Following the recent proposal of the hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for the two-site dynamical mean-field theory(DMFT), we present a modification that allows the self-consistent solution of the single bath site DMFT. The modified algorithm can easily be generalized for multiple bath sites. This approach is used to generate a database of zero-temperature wavefunctions of the Hubbard model within the DMFT approximation. We then use a QML algorithm to distinguish between the metallic phase and the Mott insulator phase to capture the metal-to-Mott insulator phase transition. We train a quantum convolutional neural network(QCNN) and then utilize the QCNN as a quantum classifier to capture the phase transition region. This work provides a recipe for application to other phase transitions in strongly correlated systems and represents an exciting application of small-scale quantum devices realizable with near-term technology.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of relative phase extraction in one-dimensional Bose gases interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>
