      <title>Degrees of Freedom of Spatial Multiplexing in Distance Domain of Arbitrary Continuous-Aperture Array in Near-Field Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture array operating in the near-field regime unlocks additional spatial resources that can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction, a capability not achievable in conventional far-field systems. A fundamental question, however, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of spatial multiplexing in the distance domain?
  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF of a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit aperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at the same angular direction) but located at different distances from the transmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case where the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad side of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular array, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the constraint of the physical length of the array.</description>

      <title>Numerical Techniques for the Maximum Likelihood Toeplitz Covariance Matrix Estimation: Part I. Symmetric Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several applications, one must estimate a real-valued (symmetric) Toeplitz covariance matrix, typically shifted by the conjugated diagonal matrices of phase progression and phase "calibration" errors. Unlike the Hermitian Toeplitz covariance matrices, these symmetric matrices have a unique potential capability of being estimated regardless of these beam-steering phase progression and/or phase "calibration" errors. This unique capability is the primary motivation of this paper.</description>

      <title>Pursuing the limit of chirp parameter identifiability: A computational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that a necessary condition for unique identifiability of $K$ chirps from $N$ regularly spaced samples of their mixture is $N\geq 2K$ when $K\geq 2$. A necessary and sufficient condition is that a rank-constrained matrix optimization problem has a unique solution; this is the first result of such kind. An algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem and to identify the parameters numerically. The lower bound of $N=2K$ is shown to be tight by providing diverse problem instances for which the proposed algorithm succeeds to identify the parameters. The advantageous performance of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated compared with the state of the art.</description>

      <title>SDR-Empowered Environment Sensing Design and Experimental Validation Using OTFS-ISAC Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the system design and experimental validation of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for environmental sensing, which is expected to be a critical enabler for next-generation wireless networks. We advocate exploiting orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation for its inherent sparsity and stability in delay-Doppler (DD) domain channels, facilitating a low-overhead environment sensing design. Moreover, a comprehensive environmental sensing framework is developed, encompassing DD domain channel estimation, target localization, and experimental validation. In particular, we first explore the OTFS channel estimation in the presence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts. Given the estimated parameters, we propose a three-ellipse positioning algorithm to localize the target's position, followed by determining the mobile transmitter's velocity. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of our proposed design, we conduct extensive simulations and experiments using a software-defined radio (SDR)-based platform with universal software radio peripheral (USRP). The experimental validations demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmarks in terms of localization accuracy and velocity estimation, confirming its effectiveness in practical environmental sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Basis Expansion Extrapolation based Long-Term Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO OTFS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) combined with orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising technique for high-mobility scenarios. However, its performance could be severely degraded due to channel aging caused by user mobility and high processing latency. In this paper, an integrated scheme of uplink (UL) channel estimation and downlink (DL) channel prediction is proposed to alleviate channel aging in time division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO-OTFS systems. Specifically, first, an iterative basis expansion model (BEM) based UL channel estimation scheme is proposed to accurately estimate UL channels with the aid of carefully designed OTFS frame pattern. Then a set of Slepian sequences are used to model the estimated UL channels, and the dynamic Slepian coefficients are fitted by a set of orthogonal polynomials. A channel predictor is derived to predict DL channels by iteratively extrapolating the Slepian coefficients. Simulation results verify that the proposed UL channel estimation and DL channel prediction schemes outperform the existing schemes in terms of normalized mean square error of channel estimation/prediction and DL spectral efficiency, with less pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for VLC-based indoor Localization: Addressing Environmental Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial in industrial environments. Visible Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering high accuracy, energy efficiency, and minimal electromagnetic interference. However, VLC-based indoor localization faces challenges due to environmental variability, such as lighting fluctuations and obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based indoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL framework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization accuracy by 47\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\%, and decrease computational time by 40\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is highly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar accuracy with only 30\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable option for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.</description>

      <title>Frequency-switching Array Enhanced Physical-Layer Security in Terahertz Bands: A Movable Antenna Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new frequency-switching array (FSA) enhanced physical-layer security (PLS) system in terahertz bands, where the carrier frequency can be flexibly switched and small frequency offsets can be imposed on each antenna at Alice, so as to eliminate information wiretapping by undesired eavesdroppers. First, we analytically show that by flexibly controlling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form uniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling movable antennas (MAs) in the control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom (DoF) in the beam control. Although the proposed FSA experiences additional path-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware and signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning accuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy cost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem with a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform frequency increment. Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed FSA can flexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain (by tuning carrier frequency) and range domain (by controlling per-antenna frequency offset), thereby achieving improved PLS performance. Then, for the general case, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex problem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) and projected gradient ascent (PGA) techniques. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the convergence of the proposed optimization algorithm and its superiority over fixed-position arrays (FPAs) in terms of secrecy-rate performance.</description>

      <title>Token Communication in the Era of Large Models: An Information Bottleneck-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes UniToCom, a unified token communication paradigm that treats tokens as the fundamental units for both processing and wireless transmission. Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this, GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling, maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for next-generation intelligent communications.</description>

      <title>Position and Velocity Estimation Accuracy in MIMO-OFDM ISAC Networks: A Fisher Information Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a core technology for future wireless networks, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable data transmission within a unified radio platform. This paper develops a theoretical framework to assess the estimation accuracy of target position and velocity in heterogeneous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC networks with multiple cooperative and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base stations (BSs). Using Fisher information analysis, we first derive closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for target localization in single monostatic and bistatic configurations. We then analyze the benefits of BS cooperation by deriving CRLBs for joint position and velocity estimation in a general setting that encompasses multiple cooperating monostatic systems and multistatic networks with multiple transmitters (Txs) and receivers (Rxs). The influence of key system parameters, including the number of BSs, bandwidth, antenna array configuration, and network geometry, is systematically examined. Numerical results highlight the performance gains enabled by cooperative sensing and provide insights to guide the design of future ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Tensor-Based Deferral of Gaussian Splitting for Orbit Uncertainty Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate propagation of orbital uncertainty is essential for a range of applications within space domain awareness. Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based approaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting mixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as by reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work introduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system dynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting. This paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these robust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated with higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer substantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Second-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy while retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting. Different immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in three representative test cases, including a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit, and a periodic three-body orbit.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Evaluation of CNN-based Detection and Estimation for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless sensing applications, such as ISAC, one of the first crucial signal processing steps is the detection and estimation targets from a channel estimate. Effective algorithms in this context must be robust across a broad SNR range, capable of handling an unknown number of targets, and computationally efficient for real-time implementation. During the last decade, different Machine Learning methods have emerged as promising solutions, either as standalone models or as complementing existing techniques. However, since models are often trained and evaluated on synthetic data from existing models, applying them to measurement is challenging. All the while, training directly on measurement data is prohibitive in complex propagation scenarios as a groundtruth is not available. Therefore, in this paper, we train a CNN approach for target detection and estimation on synthetic data and evaluate it on measurement data from a suburban outdoor measurement. Using knowledge of the environment as well as available groundtruth positions, we study the detection probability and accuracy of our approach. The results demonstrate that our approach works on measurement data and is suitable for joint detection and estimation of sensing targets in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Message-Passing Transformers for Code-Agnostic Decoding in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising direction to channel coding for 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Sensing Cardiac Health Across Scenarios and Devices: A Multi-Modal Foundation Model Pretrained on Heterogeneous Data from 1.7 Million Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms (PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models, limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7 million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard 12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive cardiac monitoring.</description>

      <title>Fluid Aerial Networks: UAV Rotation for Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of aerial infrastructure, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that function as aerial base stations (ABSs) extend terrestrial network services into the sky, enabling on-demand connectivity and enhancing emergency communication capabilities in cellular networks by leveraging the flexibility and mobility of UAVs. In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates position-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate inter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages ABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency. Specifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial beamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In this direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions, revealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel correlation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an alternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for ABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate of multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark to validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS rotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in interference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can significantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and improve the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\% compared to fixed-direction ABSs without rotation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Multimodal Fusion with Mixture-of-Experts for Localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fingerprinting is a crucial technique to sub-meter 6G integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) localization, but two hurdles block deployment: (i) the contribution each modality makes to the target position varies with the operating conditions such as carrier frequency, and (ii) spatial and fingerprint ambiguities markedly undermine localization accuracy, especially in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To solve these problems, we introduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a soft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points into short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively fuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain through its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at each carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that simultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and its centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an auxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates gradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban layouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent sub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for frequency-robust ISAC localization.</description>

      <title>MmBack: Clock-free Multi-Sensor Backscatter with Synchronous Acquisition and Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscatter tags provide a low-power solution for sensor applications, yet many real-world scenarios require multiple sensors-often of different types-for complex sensing tasks. However, existing designs support only a single sensor per tag, increasing spatial overhead. State-of-the-art approaches to multiplexing multiple sensor streams on a single tag rely on onboard clocks or multiple modulation chains, which add cost, enlarge form factor, and remain prone to timing drift-disrupting synchronization across sensors.
  We present mmBack, a low-power, clock-free backscatter tag that enables synchronous multi-sensor data acquisition and multiplexing over a single modulation chain. mmBack synchronizes sensor inputs in parallel using a shared reference signal extracted from ambient RF excitation, eliminating the need for an onboard timing source. To efficiently multiplex sensor data, mmBack designs a voltage-division scheme to multiplex multiple sensor inputs as backscatter frequency shifts through a single oscillator and RF switch. At the receiver, mmBack develops a frequency tracking algorithm and a finite-state machine for accurate demultiplexing. mmBack's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW, while its prototype supports 5 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidths of up to 5kHz and 3 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidth of up to 18kHz. Evaluation shows that mmBack achieves an average SNR surpassing 15dB in signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Cross-platform Smartphone Positioning at Museums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e., Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential research directions.</description>

      <title>A Privacy-Preserving Indoor Localization System based on Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server reliability issues. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy, bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor localization systems.</description>

      <title>QHARMA-GAN: Quasi-Harmonic Neural Vocoder based on Autoregressive Moving Average Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vocoders, encoding speech signals into acoustic features and allowing for speech signal reconstruction from them, have been studied for decades. Recently, the rise of deep learning has particularly driven the development of neural vocoders to generate high-quality speech signals. On the other hand, the existing end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds the speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech, resulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and resonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying speech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation usually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption. In this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech as sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process to propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech signals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to model the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the amplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the speech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting and time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network size decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the strengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the outperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed, synthesis quality, and modification flexibility.</description>

      <title>Kernel Recursive Least Squares Dictionary Learning Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based sparse representations. In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low computational complexity. Experiments on four datasets across different domains show that our method not only outperforms existing online kernel dictionary learning approaches but also achieves classification accuracy close to that of batch-trained models, while remaining significantly more efficient.</description>

      <title>Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing with Customized Orthogonal Group Channels in Multi-RIS-Assisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the unique capability to reshape the radio environment, thereby simplifying transmission schemes traditionally contingent on channel conditions. Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface aided Integrated-Navigation-and-Communication in Urban Canyons: A Satellite Selection Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided medium-Earth-orbit (MEO) satellite network for providing both global positioning services and communication services in the urban canyons, where the direct satellite-user links are obstructed. Superposition coding (SC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are utilized for the integrated navigation and communication (INAC) networks, and the composed navigation and communication signals are reflected or transmitted to ground users or indoor users located in urban canyons. To meet diverse application needs, navigation-oriented (NO)-INAC and communication-oriented (CO)-INAC have been developed, each tailored according to distinct power allocation factors. We then proposed two algorithms, namely navigation-prioritized-algorithm (NPA) and communication-prioritized-algorithm (CPA), to improve the navigation or communication performance by selecting the satellite with the optimized position dilution of precision (PDoP) or with the best channel gain. The effectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS-aided INAC network is quantified by analyzing the positioning error for navigation services and by evaluating communication performance through achievable ergodic rate metrics. Our satellite selection approach indicates that: the positioning services at the urban canyon users can be completed with the aid of STAR-RIS. 2) Additionally, it is observed that while a single STAR-RIS array can extend the navigational link, it fails to serve users in indoor scenarios, highlighting a limitation in the current system design.</description>

Abstract: Wind noise significantly degrades the quality of outdoor audio recordings, yet remains difficult to suppress in real-time on resource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose a low-complexity single-channel deep neural network that leverages the spectral characteristics of wind noise. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art low-complexity ULCNet model. The proposed model, with only 249K parameters and roughly 73 MHz of computational power, is suitable for embedded and mobile audio applications.</description>

      <title>Automatic Rank Determination for Low-Rank Adaptation via Submodular Function Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized) approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting, alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a prominent candidate for future networks due to its ability to significantly enhance spectral efficiency by eliminating inter-cell interference. However, its practical deployment faces considerable challenges, such as high computational complexity and the optimization of its complex processing. To address these challenges, this correspondence proposes a framework based on a sparse multi-dimensional graph neural network (SP-MDGNN), which sparsifies the connections between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high performance. In addition, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm is introduced as a comparative method to further analyze the trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the sparse method achieves an optimal balance between performance and complexity, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the original MDGNN method while incurring only a slight performance degradation, providing insights for the practical deployment of CF mMIMO systems in large-scale network.</description>

Abstract: Source enumeration, the task of estimating the number of sources from the signal received by the array of antennas, is a critical problem in array signal processing. Numerous methods have been proposed to estimate the number of sources under white or colored Gaussian noise. However, their performance degrades significantly in the presence of a limited number of observations and/or a large number of sources. In this work, we propose a method leveraging the distribution of angles that performs well in (a) independent Gaussian, (b) spatially colored Gaussian, and (c) heavy-tailed noise, even when the number of sources is large. We support the supremacy of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods with extensive simulation results.</description>

      <title>Real-Time AIoT for AAV Antenna Interference Detection via Edge-Cloud Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the fifth-generation (5G) era, eliminating communication interference sources is crucial for maintaining network performance. Interference often originates from unauthorized or malfunctioning antennas, and radio monitoring agencies must address numerous sources of such antennas annually. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve inspection efficiency. However, the data transmission delay in the existing cloud-only (CO) artificial intelligence (AI) mode fails to meet the low latency requirements for real-time performance. Therefore, we propose a computer vision-based AI of Things (AIoT) system to detect antenna interference sources for UAVs. The system adopts an optimized edge-cloud collaboration (ECC+) mode, combining a keyframe selection algorithm (KSA), focusing on reducing end-to-end latency (E2EL) and ensuring reliable data transmission, which aligns with the core principles of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). At the core of our approach is an end-to-end antenna localization scheme based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, including a detector (EdgeAnt) and a tracker (AntSort). EdgeAnt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.1% on our custom antenna interference source dataset, requiring only 3 million parameters and 14.7 GFLOPs. On the COCO dataset, EdgeAnt achieves 38.9% mAP with 5.4 GFLOPs. We deployed EdgeAnt on Jetson Xavier NX (TRT) and Raspberry Pi 4B (NCNN), achieving real-time inference speeds of 21.1 (1088) and 4.8 (640) frames per second (FPS), respectively. Compared with CO mode, the ECC+ mode reduces E2EL by 88.9%, increases accuracy by 28.2%. Additionally, the system offers excellent scalability for coordinated multiple UAVs inspections. The detector code is publicly available at https://github.com/SCNU-RISLAB/EdgeAnt.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel radar signal detection pipeline focused on detecting large targets such as cars and SUVs. Traditional methods, such as Ordered-Statistic Constant False Alarm Rate (OS-CFAR), commonly used in automotive radar, are designed for point or isotropic target models. These may not adequately capture the Range-Doppler (RD) scattering patterns of larger targets, especially in high-resolution radar systems. Additional modules such as association and tracking are necessary to refine and consolidate the detections over multiple dwells. To address these limitations, we propose a detection technique based on the probability density function (pdf) of RD segments, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold neural network (KAN) to learn the data and generate interpretable symbolic expressions for binary hypotheses. Beside the Monte-Carlo study showing better performance for the proposed KAN expression over OS-CFAR, it is shown to exhibit a probability of detection (PD) of 96% when transfer learned with field data. The false alarm rate (PFA) is comparable with OS-CFAR designed with PFA = $10^{-6}$. Additionally, the study also examines impact of the number of pdf bins representing RD segment on performance of the KAN-based detection.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Ambiguity Function of Narrowband Near-field MIMO Radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper compares the sensing performance of a narrowband near-field system across several practical antenna array geometries and SIMO/MISO and MIMO configurations. For identical transmit and receive apertures, MIMO processing is equivalent to squaring the near-field array factor, resulting in improved beamdepth and sidelobe level. Analytical derivations, supported by simulations, show that the MIMO processing improves the maximum near-field sensing range and resolution by approximately a factor of 1.4 compared to a single-aperture system. Using a quadratic approximation of the mainlobe of the array factor, an analytical improvement factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is derived, validating the numerical results. Finally, MIMO is shown to improve the poor sidelobe performance observed in the near-field by a factor of two, due to squaring of the array factor.</description>

      <title>Feature Reweighting for EEG-based Motor Imagery Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification of motor imagery (MI) using non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is a critical objective as it is used to predict the intention of limb movements of a subject. In recent research, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been widely utilized for MI-EEG classification. The challenges of training neural networks for MI-EEG signals classification include low signal-to-noise ratio, non-stationarity, non-linearity, and high complexity of EEG signals. The features computed by CNN-based networks on the highly noisy MI-EEG signals contain irrelevant information. Subsequently, the feature maps of the CNN-based network computed from the noisy and irrelevant features contain irrelevant information. Thus, many non-contributing features often mislead the neural network training and degrade the classification performance. Hence, a novel feature reweighting approach is proposed to address this issue. The proposed method gives a noise reduction mechanism named feature reweighting module that suppresses irrelevant temporal and channel feature maps. The feature reweighting module of the proposed method generates scores that reweight the feature maps to reduce the impact of irrelevant information. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improved the classification of MI-EEG signals of Physionet EEG-MMIDB and BCI Competition IV 2a datasets by a margin of 9.34% and 3.82%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware and Routing-Flexible Network Slicing for Service-Oriented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests (also called services) to a common shared network infrastructure and manage network resources to meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for the considered NS problem that can flexibly route the traffic flow of the services on multiple paths and provide end-to-end delay and reliability guarantees for all services. To overcome the computational difficulty due to the intrinsic nonlinearity in the MINLP formulation, we transform the MINLP formulation into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and further show that their continuous relaxations are equivalent. In sharp contrast to the continuous relaxation of the MINLP formulation which is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem, the continuous relaxation of the MILP formulation is a polynomial-time solvable linear programming problem, which significantly facilitates the algorithmic design. Based on the newly proposed MILP formulation, we develop a customized column generation (cCG) algorithm for solving the NS problem. The proposed cCG algorithm is a decomposition-based algorithm and is particularly suitable for solving large-scale NS problems. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulations and the proposed cCG algorithm.</description>

      <title>Adaptive NAD: Online and Self-adaptive Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.
