      <title>Back to harmonic mappings of compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address several interconnected problems in the theory of harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. First, we present necessary background and establish one of the main results of the paper: a criterion characterizing when a smooth submersion or diffeomorphism between Riemannian manifolds is harmonic. This result provides a useful analytic condition for verifying the harmonicity of geometric mappings. Second, we investigate the L2-orthogonal decomposition of the pullback metric associated with a harmonic map. We analyze the structure of this decomposition and discuss its geometric implications, particularly in the context of the energy density and trace conditions. Finally, we study harmonic symmetric bilinear forms and harmonic Riemannian metrics. Special attention is given to their role in the theory of harmonic identity maps. We derive new results that link these notions and demonstrate how they contribute to the broader understanding of harmonicity in geometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Riemannian curvature of gaussian distribution in dual coordinate system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric nonlinearity properties, such as curvature and torsion, in a dual coordinate system of the Riemannian manifold defined by the Gaussian distribution. We also give the Amari formulas explicitly in this new coordinate system, which allows us to characterize existing geometric invariants, such as the dual potential function and the Fisher metric.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Topological Sigma Models and Doubling Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Witten's topological B-model on a Calabi-Yau background is known to reproduce, in the open string sector, the derived category of coherent sheaves. When the target space is a complex torus, the topological model enjoys a non-geometric symmetry known as T-duality, which relates the theories on the torus and dual torus backgrounds. By considering the "double field theory" of Hull and Reid-Edwards on the product of a torus and its dual, T-duality occurs as a geometric symmetry of the target space.
  Building on the methods of Y. Qin, we propose a method of analyzing the topological B-model on a torus in the doubled geometry framework which naturally incorporates certain rank-one D-branes, providing a different perspective on the derived category of the torus. In certain cases, the intersection theory of these lifted branes correctly computes the BRST cohomology of the B-model, and hence the derived Hom-spaces of the corresponding line bundles.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Lie categories and Yang-Mills theory for multiplicative Ehresmann connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first and shorter part of the thesis deals with the structural assumption of invertibility in a Lie groupoid. When this assumption is dropped, we obtain the notion of a Lie category: a small category, endowed with a compatible differentiable structure. We introduce various examples of Lie categories, examine their differences and similarities with Lie groupoids, and research the notions emerging naturally from the lack of invertibility of arrows. The aim of the second and principal part of this thesis is to provide a far-reaching generalization of Yang-Mills theory, extending it from the classical setting of principal bundles to general Lie groupoids and algebroids. The notion of a principal bundle connection is now replaced with that of a more general multiplicative Ehresmann connection. In obtaining this generalization, we make various advances to the theory of such connections, as well as invariant linear connections on representations. We develop the obstruction classes for their existence, generalize the (horizontal) exterior covariant derivative to the representation-valued Bott-Shulman-Stasheff and Weil complexes, and inspect their relationship with the van Est map. We research the class of multiplicative connections with cohomologically trivial curvature, which are central to obtaining the desired generalization. Applying the variational principle to this framework rests upon our developed formulae for affine deformations of multiplicative connections. Ultimately, we develop the extension of Yang-Mills theory to a non-integrable and non-transitive setting: the classical Yang-Mills equation is upgraded to a gauge-invariant pair of equations, which now describe the dynamics of gauge fields in both the longitudinal and transversal directions with respect to the (singular) orbit foliation. As an example, we obtain a Yang-Mills theory for $S^1$-bundle gerbes.</description>

      <title>Reilly inequality for Varifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Reilly inequality gives an upper bound for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian defined on compact submanifolds of the Euclidean space in terms of the $L^2$-norm of the mean curvature vector. In this paper, we generalize this inequality in a Varifold context. In particular we generalize it for the class of $H(2)$ varifolds and for polygons and we analyse the equality case.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of an overdetermined heat equation and minimal helicoids in space-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold and $\Omega$ a smooth domain of $M$. We study the following heat diffusion problem: assume that the initial temperature is equal to $1$, uniformly on $\Omega$, and is $0$ on its complement. Heat will then flow away from $\Omega$ to its complement, and we are interested in the temperature on the boundary of $\Omega$ at all positive times $t&gt;0$. In particular we ask: are there domains for which the temperature at the boundary is a constant $c$, for all positive times $t$ and for all points of the boundary? If they exist, what can we say about their geometry?
  This is a typical example of overdetermined heat equation. It is readily seen that if $c$ exists it must be $\frac 12$, and domains with constant boundary temperature will be said to have the $\frac 12$-property. Previous work by \cite{MPS06} and \cite{CSU23} show that, on $\mathbb R^3$, the only such domains (up to congruences) have boundary which is a plane or (a bit surprisingly) the right helicoid.
  In this paper we first show that, in great generality, the boundary of a $\frac 12$-domain must be minimal; we then extend (with a different proof) the above classification from $\mathbb R^3$ to the other $3$-dimensional space-forms. We prove that, in $\mathbb S^3$, $\frac 12$-domains are bounded by a totally geodesic surface or the Clifford torus, and in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb H^3$ are bounded by a totally geodesic surface or by an (embedded) minimal hyperbolic helicoid. %(there is a one-parameter family of such surfaces) As a by-product, we extend (with a different proof) a result by Nitsche on uniformly dense domains from $\mathbb R^3$ to $3$-dimensional space-forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the volume entropy and the second Cheeger constant and prove a sharp isoperimetric inequality involving the volume entropy on Finsler metric measure manifolds with non-negative weighted Ricci curvature ${\rm Ric}_{\infty}$. As an application, we prove a Cheeger-Buser type inequality for the first eigenvalue of Finsler Laplacian by using the volume entropy and the second Cheeger constant.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. III: Poisson brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, under suitable conditions, finite-dimensional systems describing invariant solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) inherit local Hamiltonian operators through the mechanism of invariant reduction, which applies uniformly to point, contact, and higher symmetries. The inherited operators endow the reduced systems with Poisson bivectors that relate constants of motion to symmetries. Applying the same mechanism to invariant conservation laws, we further show that the induced Poisson brackets agree with those of the original systems, up to sign. This is illustrated by two examples in which the inherited Poisson brackets and inherited constants of motion yield integrability of the reduced systems.</description>

      <title>On Axially Symmetric Perturbations of Kerr Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of a positive-definite and conserved energy is a serious obstacle in the black hole stability problem. In this work, we will show that there exists a positive-definite and conserved Hamiltonian energy for axially symmetric linear perturbations of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes. In the first part, based on the Hamiltonian dimensional reduction of 3+1 axially symmetric, Ricci-flat Lorentzian spacetimes to a 2+1 Einstein-wave map system with the negatively curved hyperbolic 2-plane target, we construct a positive-definite, spacetime gauge-invariant energy functional for linear axially symmetric perturbations in the exterior of Kerr black holes, in a manner that is also gauge-independent on the target manifold. In the construction of the positive-definite energy, various dynamical terms at the boundary of the orbit space occur critically. In the second part, after setting up the initial value problem in harmonic coordinates, we prove that the positive energy for the axially symmetric linear perturbative theory of Kerr black holes is strictly conserved in time, by establishing that all the boundary terms dynamically vanish for all times. This result implies a form of dynamical linear stability of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Transformers excel when dealing with sequential data. Generalizing transformer models to geometric domains, such as manifolds, we encounter the problem of not having a well-defined global order. We propose a solution with attention heads following a space-filling curve. As a first experimental example, we present the Spiroformer, a transformer that follows a polar spiral on the $2$-sphere.</description>

      <title>The Miyaoka-Yau inequality for singular varieties with big canonical or anticanonical divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for $n$-dimensional projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor $K_X$: \[ (2(n+1)\widehat{c}_2(X) - n \widehat{c}_1(X)^2) \cdot \langle c_1(K_X)^{n-2} \rangle \ge 0. \] We also prove the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for K-semistable projective klt varieties with big anticanonical divisor $-K_X$. As part of our approach, we define the non-pluripolar product $\langle \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p \rangle$ on singular varieties, and establish the Bogomolov-Gieseker type inequality for $\langle \alpha^{n-1} \rangle$-semistable Higgs sheaves with respect to a big class $\alpha$. In addition, we investigate second Chern class inequalities in the cases where $K_X$ or $-K_X$ is nef.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study real left-invariant spin Gaussian fields on $SO(3)$, a special class of non-isotropic random fields used to model the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Leveraging recent results from "New chaos decomposition of Gaussian nodal volumes" (arXiv:2505.22350), we provide an explicit formula for the Wiener-It\^o chaos decomposition of the area measure of level sets of such random fields. Our analysis represents a step forward in the study of second-order asymptotic properties of the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures of excursion sets of spin random fields. Remarkably, our formulas reveal a clear difference between the high frequency regime and the zero spin case.</description>

      <title>Varifold solutions to Volume-Preserving Mean Curvature Flow: existence and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution we introduce a novel weak solution concept for two-phase volume-preserving mean curvature flow, having both properties of unconditional global-in-time existence and weak-strong uniqueness. These solutions extend the ones proposed by Hensel-Laux [J. Differential Geom. 130, 209-268 (2025)] for the standard mean curvature flow, and consist in evolving varifolds coupled with the phase volumes by a transport equation. First, we show that, in the same setting as in Takasao [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 247, 52 (2023)], any sharp interface limit of solutions to a slightly modified nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation is a varifold solution according to our new definition. Secondly, we crucially introduce a new notion of volume-preserving gradient-flow calibrations, allowing the extended velocity vector field to point in the normal direction on the interface. We show that any sufficiently regular strong solution is calibrated in this sense. Finally, we prove that any classical solution to volume-preserving mean curvature flow, which is then automatically a calibrated flow, is unique in the class of our new varifold solutions.</description>

Abstract: For a small polarised deformation of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler manifold, under some cohomological vanishing conditions, we prove that K-polystability along nearby polarisations implies the existence of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric. In this setting, we reduce K-polystability to the computation of the classical Futaki invariant on the cscK degeneration. Our result holds on specific families and provides local wall-crossing phenomena for the moduli of cscK manifolds when the polarisation varies.</description>

Abstract: We study the moduli space of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler surfaces around the toric ones. To this aim, we introduce the class of foldable surfaces : smooth toric surfaces whose lattice automorphism group contain a non trivial cyclic subgroup. We classify such surfaces and show that they all admit a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric (cscK metric). We then study the moduli space of polarised cscK surfaces around a point given by a foldable surface, and show that it is locally modeled on a finite quotient of a toric affine variety with terminal singularities.</description>

      <title>Thinner Latent Spaces: Detecting Dimension and Imposing Invariance with Conformal Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Conformal Autoencoders are a neural network architecture that imposes orthogonality conditions between the gradients of latent variables to obtain disentangled representations of data. In this work we show that orthogonality relations within the latent layer of the network can be leveraged to infer the intrinsic dimensionality of nonlinear manifold data sets (locally characterized by the dimension of their tangent space), while simultaneously computing encoding and decoding (embedding) maps. We outline the relevant theory relying on differential geometry, and describe the corresponding gradient-descent optimization algorithm. The method is applied to several data sets and we highlight its applicability, advantages, and shortcomings. In addition, we demonstrate that the same computational technology can be used to build coordinate invariance to local group actions when defined only on a (reduced) submanifold of the embedding space.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Efficiency and Comparison of Different Numerical Differentiation Methods on Three Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without question regarding its pivotal significance, the computation of function derivatives carries substantial weight within a multitude of engineering and applied mathematical fields. These encompass optimization, the development of nonlinear control systems, and the assessment of noisy time signals, among others. In this study, we have chosen three illustrative cases: the logistic model for population dynamics, temperature variation within buildings, and the determination of market equilibrium prices. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of various numerical differentiation techniques and conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes for each of these case studies. To achieve this objective, we employed three distinct numerical differentiation techniques: The Forward, Backward, and Centered FiniteDifference methods, each executed in two different levels of precision, totaling six variations. Our findings clearly indicate that, for the initial case study, the methods characterized by lower computational costs (specifically, the Forward and Backward Finite-Difference methods) yield superior outcomes. In contrast, for the second case study, the Centered Finite-Difference method delivers better results. In the case of the third case study, our results reveal that none of the methods produce estimations that meet acceptable standards. It is noteworthy that the empirical equations for each case study have been validated against previous literature.</description>
