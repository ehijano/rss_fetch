      <title>Modeling and Analyzing Urban Networks and Amenities with OSMnx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design -- in addition to the scientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Optical To Thermal Inference in Pool Boiling Using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase change plays a critical role in thermal management systems, yet quantitative characterization of multiphase heat transfer remains limited by the challenges of measuring temperature fields in chaotic, rapidly evolving flow regimes. While computational methods offer spatiotemporal resolution in idealized cases, replicating complex experimental conditions remains prohibitively difficult. Here, we present a data-driven framework that leverages a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to infer temperature fields from geometric phase contours in a canonical pool boiling configuration where advanced data collection techniques are restricted. Using high-speed imaging data and simulation-informed training, our model demonstrates the ability to reconstruct temperature fields with errors below 6%. We further show that standard data augmentation strategies are effective in enhancing both accuracy and physical plausibility of the predicted maps across both simulation and experimental datasets when precise physical constraints are not applicable. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to bridge the gap between observable multiphase phenomena and underlying thermal transport, offering a powerful approach to augment and interpret experimental measurements in complex two-phase systems.</description>

      <title>A sub-volt near-IR lithium tantalate electro-optic modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a low-loss integrated electro-optic Mach-Zehnder modulator in thin-film lithium tantalate at 737 nm, featuring a low half-wave voltage-length product of 0.65 V$\cdot$cm, an extinction ratio of 30 dB, low optical loss of 5.3 dB, and a detector-limited bandwidth of 20 GHz. A small $&lt;2$ dB DC bias drift relative to quadrature bias is measured over 16 minutes using 4.3 dBm of on-chip power in ambient conditions, which outperforms the 8 dB measured using a counterpart thin-film lithium niobate modulator. Finally, an optical loss coefficient of 0.5 dB/cm for a thin-film lithium tantalate waveguide is estimated at 638 nm using a fabricated ring resonator.</description>

      <title>TunnElQNN: A Hybrid Quantum-classical Neural Network for Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) represent a promising frontier in machine learning, leveraging the complementary strengths of both models. In this work, we propose the development of TunnElQNN, a non-sequential architecture composed of alternating classical and quantum layers. Within the classical component, we employ the Tunnelling Diode Activation Function (TDAF), inspired by the I-V characteristics of quantum tunnelling. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model on a synthetic dataset of interleaving half-circle for multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of class overlap. The model is compared against a baseline hybrid architecture that uses the conventional ReLU activation function (ReLUQNN). Our results show that the TunnElQNN model consistently outperforms the ReLUQNN counterpart. Furthermore, we analyse the decision boundaries generated by TunnElQNN under different levels of class overlap and compare them to those produced by a neural network implementing TDAF within a fully classical architecture. These findings highlight the potential of integrating physics-inspired activation functions with quantum components to enhance the expressiveness and robustness of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Transforming physics-informed machine learning to convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.</description>

      <title>Phase-shifting structured illumination with polarization-encoded metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-shifting structured illumination is a powerful technique used across diverse imaging modalities, including 3D surface measurement, quantitative phase imaging, and super-resolution microscopy. However, conventional implementations often rely on mechanically driven or optoelectronically complex systems, limiting their compactness, stability, and integration. Here, we present a polarization-controlled dielectric metasurface that generates phase-shifting fringe patterns in the visible spectrum, enabling compact and robust structured light projection. The metasurface encodes distinct phase gratings for orthogonal polarizations, producing fringe patterns with relative lateral displacements that vary according to the polarization of the transmitted light. We experimentally demonstrate high-quality fringe generation and apply the structured illumination in a fringe projection profilometry system for 3D surface measurement of different objects. The metasurface integrates multiple phase-shifting steps into a single static device, offering a millimeter-scale footprint and compatibility with polarization multiplexing. This approach introduces a compact, passive solution for structured light generation with broad potential in next-generation optical metrology and advanced computational imaging.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of mirror-symmetric disordered systems for broadband perfect transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for achieving broadband perfect wave transmission in complex systems by optimizing symmetric disordered media via inverse design. We show that leveraging symmetry of complex media reduces the optimization's complexity enabling the incorporation of additional constraints in the parameter space. Starting from a single perfectly transmitting state with predefined input and output wavefronts at a specific frequency, we progressively broaden the bandwidth - from a reflectionless exceptional point with a flattened lineshape to narrowband filters and ultimately to broadband quasi-perfect transmission exhibiting a rainbow effect. Numerical simulations based on the coupled dipole approximation are validated experimentally in a multichannel microwave waveguide with dielectric and metallic scatterers. Finally, we demonstrate broadband enhanced wave transmission through barriers highlighting the potential for advanced wave control applications.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic waveguide chip-to-free-space beam scanning at 68 Million Spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seamless chip-to-world photonic interface enables wide-ranging advancements in optical ranging, display, communication, computation, imaging, and light-matter interaction. An optimal solution allows for 2D scanning of a diffraction-limited beam from anywhere on a photonic chip over a large number of beam-spots in free-space. Currently, devices with direct PIC integration rely on tiled apertures with poor mode qualities, large footprints, and complex control systems. Micro-mechanical beam scanners have good beam quality but lack direct PIC integration and are inertially-limited due to the use of bulk optical components or structures in which the optical aperture and actuator sizes are inextricably linked, resulting in trade-offs among resolution, speed, and footprint. Here, we overcome these limitations with the photonic "ski-jump": a nanoscale optical waveguide monolithically integrated atop a piezoelectrically actuated cantilever which passively curls ~90$^{\circ}$ out-of-plane in a footprint of &lt;0.1 mm$^{2}$, emits sub-micron diffraction-limited optical modes, and exhibits kHz-rate mechanical resonances with quality factors exceeding 10,000. This enables two-dimensional beam-scanning with footprint-adjusted spot-rates of 68.6 mega-spots/(s$\cdot$mm$^{2}$) at CMOS-level voltages, which is equivalent to a 1 megapixel display at 100 Hz from a 1.5 mm$^{2}$ footprint, and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art MEMS mirrors by &gt;50$\times$. Using this device, we demonstrate image projection, video projection, and the initialization and readout of single photons from silicon vacancy centers in diamond waveguides. Based on current performance, we identify pathways for achieving &gt;1 giga-spots at kHz-rates in a ~1 cm$^{2}$ area to provide a seamless, scalable optical pipeline between integrated photonic processors and the free-space world.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Directional Couplers with Oxide Cladding: Bridging Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated photonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design where precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure reliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However, discrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed. These inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated photonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise simulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In this work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density changes in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving experimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron microscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We find that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as feature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using a novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we achieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify the effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters that govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial for advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable simulation of photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Beware of the water: Hidden hydrogenation of perovskite membranes made by the water-soluble sacrificial layer method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fabrication of perovskite oxide free-standing films (membranes) by lift-off methods using water-soluble sacrificial layers is appealing because of the new mechanical degrees of freedom that these membranes present over conventional epitaxial films. However, little is known about how their fabrication process, and in particular the exposure to water during the etching step, affects their properties. Here, we investigate how membranes of two perovskite archetypes, antiferroelectric PbZrO3 and paraelectric SrTiO3, are affected by water-based etching step. Using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we find evidence that hydrogen penetrates the perovskite structure. Concomitant with this protonation, the functional properties also change, and both materials display ferroelectric-like behavior that is absent in bulk ceramics or hydrogen-free films at room temperature. We also find that thermal annealing can be used to expel the hydrogen from the membranes, which henceforth recover bulk-like properties. The two main conclusions of this work are that (i) any perovskite membrane made by sacrificial layer hydrolysis is vulnerable to hydrogen penetration (protonation) that can induce important but extrinsic changes in functional properties, and (ii) the hydrogen can, and should, be expelled by annealing to recover intrinsic behaviour.</description>
