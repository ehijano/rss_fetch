      <title>Exactly Solvable Population Model with Square-Root Growth Noise and Cell-Size Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a size-structured branching process in which individual cells grow exponentially according to a Feller square-root process and divide under general size-control mechanisms. We obtain exact expressions for the asymptotic population growth rate, the steady-state snapshot distribution of cell sizes, and the fluctuations of the total cell number. Our first result is that the population growth rate is exactly equal to the mean single-cell growth rate, for all noise strengths and for all division and size-regulation schemes that maintain size homeostasis. Thus square-root growth noise is neutral with respect to long-term fitness, in sharp contrast to models with size-independent stochastic growth rates. Second, we show that the steady-state population cell-size distribution is obtained from the deterministic inverse-square-law solution by a one-sided exponential convolution with kernel width set by the strength of growth fluctuations. Third, the mean-rescaled population size $N_t/\left\langle N_t\right\rangle$ converges to a stationary compound Poisson-exponential distribution that depends only on growth noise. This distribution, and hence the long-time shape of population-size fluctuations, is unchanged by division-size noise or asymmetric partitioning. These results identify Feller-type exponential growth with square-root noise as an exactly solvable benchmark for stochastic growth in size-controlled populations and provide concrete signatures that distinguish it from models with size-independent growth-rate noise.</description>

      <title>Tree Thinking in the Genomic Era: Unifying Models Across Cells, Populations, and Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing explosion of genome sequence data is transforming how we reconstruct and understand the histories of biological systems. Across biological scales, from individual cells to populations and species, trees-based models provide a common framework for representing ancestry. Once limited to species phylogenetics, "tree thinking" now extends deeply to population genomics and cell biology, revealing the genealogical structure of genetic and phenotypic variation within and across organisms. Recently, there have been great methodological and computational advances on tree-based methods, including methods for inferring ancestral recombination graphs in populations, phylogenetic frameworks for comparative genomics, and lineage-tracing techniques in developmental and cancer biology. Despite differences in data types and biological contexts, these approaches share core statistical and algorithmic challenges: efficiently inferring branching histories from genomic information, integrating temporal and spatial signals, and connecting genealogical structures to evolutionary and functional processes. Recognizing these shared foundations opens opportunities for cross-fertilization between fields that are traditionally studied in isolation. By examining how tree-based methods are applied across cellular, population, and species scales, we identify the conceptual parallels that unite them and the distinct challenges that each domain presents. These comparisons offer new perspectives that can inform algorithmic innovations and lead to more powerful inference strategies across the full spectrum of biological systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Environments Favor Extreme Dormancy Strategies and Penalize Intermediate Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dormancy is a widespread adaptive strategy that enables populations to persist in fluctuating environments, yet how its benefits depend on the temporal structure of environmental variability remains unclear. We examine how dormancy interacts with environmental correlation times using a delayed-logistic model in which dormant individuals reactivate after a fixed lag while birth rates fluctuate under temporally correlated stochasticity. Numerical simulations and analytical calculations show that the combination of demographic memory and colored multiplicative noise generates a strongly non-monotonic dependence of fitness on dormancy duration, with three distinct performance regimes. Very short dormancy maximizes linear growth but amplifies fluctuations and extinction risk. Very long dormancy buffers environmental variability, greatly increasing mean extinction times despite slower growth. Strikingly, we find a broad band of intermediate dormancy durations that is maladaptive, simultaneously reducing both growth and persistence due to a mismatch between delay times and environmental autocorrelation. An evolutionary agent-based model confirms bistability between short- and long-dormancy strategies, which avoid intermediate lag times and evolve toward stable extremes. These results show that dormancy duration is not merely a life-history parameter but an adaptive mechanism tuned to environmental timescales, and that intermediate "dangerous middle" strategies can be inherently disfavored. More broadly, this work identifies a generic mechanism by which demographic delays interacting with correlated environmental variability produce a non-monotonic fitness landscape that selects for extreme timing strategies.</description>

      <title>The Effective Reproduction Number in the Kermack-McKendrick model with age of infection and reinfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel epidemiological model that expands upon the Kermack-McKendrick model by incorporating the age of infection and reinfection. By including infection age, we can classify participants, which enables a more targeted analysis within the modeling framework. The reinfection term addresses the real-world occurrences of secondary or recurrent viral infections. In the theoretical part, we apply the contraction mapping principle, the dominated convergence theorem, and the properties of Volterra integral equations to derive analytical expressions for the number of newly infected individuals denoted by $N(t)$. Then, we establish a Volterra integral equation for $N(t)$ and study its initial conditions for both a single cohort and multiple cohorts. From this equation, we derive a method for identifying the effective reproduction number, denoted as $\mathcal{R}(t)$. In the practical aspect, we present two distinct methods and separately apply them to analyze the daily new infection cases from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and the cumulative number of deaths from the COVID-19 epidemic in China. This work effectively bridges theoretical epidemiology and computational modeling, providing a robust framework for analyzing infection dynamics influenced by infection-age-structured transmission and reinfection mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Great Oxidation Event (GOE): Biogeochemical Feedback and Tipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximately 1.4 Ga after life first appeared, atmospheric oxygen suddenly jumped by more than an order of magnitude over a 20-50 Ma period. The contrast between these two timescales does not seem to be due to any sudden, large amplitude change in external forcing. However, it could be due to processes intrinsic to the geobiological system itself, namely, positive feedback between atmospheric oxygen and photosynthetic bacteria: More oxygen leads to more photosynthesis, which leads to more oxygen, and so on. Already-published feedbacks include buildup of an ozone shield and nutrient production by oxidative weathering. The feedback proposed here is the 15-fold greater efficiency of aerobic vs anaerobic respiration and the tight coupling of respiration and photosynthesis inside the cell. As in the climate system, feedback leads to tipping points, where a rapid, large amplitude change in the state of the system occurs. For the geobiological system, the GOE is the tipping point, and the long buildup before the GOE is the gradual oxidation of the crust and ocean, due either to burial of organic matter, oxidation of volcanic gases, or escape of hydrogen to space. The feedback hypothesis is a framework for interpreting observations leading to the GOE.</description>

      <title>Continuous approximations for the fixation probability of the Moran processes on star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalized version of the birth-death (BD) and death-birth (DB) processes introduced by Kaveh, Komarova, and Kohandel (2015), in which two constant fitnesses, one for birth and the other for death, describe the selection mechanism of the population. Rather than constant fitnesses, in this paper we consider more general frequency-dependent fitness functions (allowing any smooth functions) under the weak-selection regime. A particular case arises in evolutionary games on graphs, where the fitness functions are linear combinations of the frequencies of types. For a large population structured as a star graph, we provide approximations for the fixation probability which are solutions of certain ODEs (or systems of ODEs). For the DB case, we prove that our approximation has an error of order $1/N$, where $N$ is the size of the population.
  The general BD and DB processes contain, as special cases, the BD-* and DB-* (where * can be either B or D) processes described in Hadjichrysanthou, Broom, and Rycht\'a\v{r} (2011) -- this class includes many examples of update rules used in the literature. Our analysis shows how the star graph may act as an amplifier, suppressor, or remains isothermal depending on the scaling of the initial mutant placement. We identify an analytical threshold for this transition and illustrate it through applications to evolutionary games, which further highlight asymmetric structural effects across different game types. Numerical examples show that our fixation probability approximations remain accurate even for moderate population sizes and across a wide range of frequency-dependent fitness functions, extending well beyond previously studied linear cases derived from evolutionary games, or constant fitness scenarios.</description>
