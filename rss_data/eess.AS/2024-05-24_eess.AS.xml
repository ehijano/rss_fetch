      <title>Multilingual Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with Hybrid CTC/RNN-T Fast Conformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are adept at leveraging visual cues from lip movements for recognizing speech in adverse listening conditions. Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) models follow similar approach to achieve robust speech recognition in noisy conditions. In this work, we present a multilingual AVSR model incorporating several enhancements to improve performance and audio noise robustness. Notably, we adapt the recently proposed Fast Conformer model to process both audio and visual modalities using a novel hybrid CTC/RNN-T architecture. We increase the amount of audio-visual training data for six distinct languages, generating automatic transcriptions of unlabelled multilingual datasets (VoxCeleb2 and AVSpeech). Our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the LRS3 dataset, reaching WER of 0.8%. On the recently introduced MuAViC benchmark, our model yields an absolute average-WER reduction of 11.9% in comparison to the original baseline. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to perform audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual speech recognition at test time.</description>

      <title>FairLENS: Assessing Fairness in Law Enforcement Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques have become powerful tools, enhancing efficiency in law enforcement scenarios. To ensure fairness for demographic groups in different acoustic environments, ASR engines must be tested across a variety of speakers in realistic settings. However, describing the fairness discrepancies between models with confidence remains a challenge. Meanwhile, most public ASR datasets are insufficient to perform a satisfying fairness evaluation. To address the limitations, we built FairLENS - a systematic fairness evaluation framework. We propose a novel and adaptable evaluation method to examine the fairness disparity between different models. We also collected a fairness evaluation dataset covering multiple scenarios and demographic dimensions. Leveraging this framework, we conducted fairness assessments on 1 open-source and 11 commercially available state-of-the-art ASR models. Our results reveal that certain models exhibit more biases than others, serving as a fairness guideline for users to make informed choices when selecting ASR models for a given real-world scenario. We further explored model biases towards specific demographic groups and observed that shifts in the acoustic domain can lead to the emergence of new biases.</description>

      <title>Contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition with Dynamic Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep biasing (DB) improves the performance of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) for rare words or contextual phrases using a bias list. However, most existing methods treat bias phrases as sequences of subwords in a predefined static vocabulary, which can result in ineffective learning of the dependencies between subwords. More advanced techniques address this problem by incorporating additional text data, which increases the overall workload. This paper proposes a dynamic vocabulary where phrase-level bias tokens can be added during the inference phase. Each bias token represents an entire bias phrase within a single token, thereby eliminating the need to learn the dependencies between the subwords within the bias phrases. This method can be applied to various architectures because it only extends the embedding and output layers in common E2E-ASR architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of bias phrases on English and Japanese datasets.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Streaming and Non-Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition with Multi-Decoder and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) can operate in two modes: streaming and non-streaming, each with its pros and cons. Streaming ASR processes the speech frames in real-time as it is being received, while non-streaming ASR waits for the entire speech utterance; thus, professionals may have to operate in either mode to satisfy their application. In this work, we present joint optimization of streaming and non-streaming ASR based on multi-decoder and knowledge distillation. Primarily, we study 1) the encoder integration of these ASR modules, followed by 2) separate decoders to make the switching mode flexible, and enhancing performance by 3) incorporating similarity-preserving knowledge distillation between the two modular encoders and decoders. Evaluation results show 2.6%-5.3% relative character error rate reductions (CERR) on CSJ for streaming ASR, and 8.3%-9.7% relative CERRs for non-streaming ASR within a single model compared to multiple standalone modules.</description>

      <title>Continued Pretraining for Domain Adaptation of Wav2vec2.0 in Automatic Speech Recognition for Elementary Math Classroom Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones, classroom conditions as well as classroom demographics. Our CPT models show improved ability to generalize to different demographics unseen in the labeled finetuning data.</description>

      <title>Non-autoregressive real-time Accent Conversion model with voice cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the development of Foreign Accent Conversion (FAC) models utilizes deep neural network architectures, as well as ensembles of neural networks for speech recognition and speech generation. The use of these models is limited by architectural features, which does not allow flexible changes in the timbre of the generated speech and requires the accumulation of context, leading to increased delays in generation and makes these systems unsuitable for use in real-time multi-user communication scenarios. We have developed the non-autoregressive model for real-time accent conversion with voice cloning. The model generates native-sounding L1 speech with minimal latency based on input L2 accented speech. The model consists of interconnected modules for extracting accent, gender, and speaker embeddings, converting speech, generating spectrograms, and decoding the resulting spectrogram into an audio signal. The model has the ability to save, clone and change the timbre, gender and accent of the speaker's voice in real time. The results of the objective assessment show that the model improves speech quality, leading to enhanced recognition performance in existing ASR systems. The results of subjective tests show that the proposed accent and gender encoder improves the generation quality. The developed model demonstrates high-quality low-latency accent conversion, voice cloning, and speech enhancement capabilities, making it suitable for real-time multi-user communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>You don't understand me!: Comparing ASR results for L1 and L2 speakers of Swedish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems has constantly increased in state-of-the-art development. However, performance tends to decrease considerably in more challenging conditions (e.g., background noise, multiple speaker social conversations) and with more atypical speakers (e.g., children, non-native speakers or people with speech disorders), which signifies that general improvements do not necessarily transfer to applications that rely on ASR, e.g., educational software for younger students or language learners. In this study, we focus on the gap in performance between recognition results for native and non-native, read and spontaneous, Swedish utterances transcribed by different ASR services. We compare the recognition results using Word Error Rate and analyze the linguistic factors that may generate the observed transcription errors.</description>

      <title>Ambisonizer: Neural Upmixing as Spherical Harmonics Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural upmixing, the task of generating immersive music with an increased number of channels from fewer input channels, has been an active research area, with mono-to-stereo and stereo-to-surround upmixing treated as separate problems. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to neural upmixing by formulating it as spherical harmonics - more specifically, Ambisonic generation. We explicitly formulate mono upmixing as unconditional generation and stereo upmixing as conditional generation, where the stereo signals serve as conditions. We provide evidence that our proposed methodology, when decoded to stereo, matches a strong commercial stereo widener in subjective ratings. Overall, our work presents direct upmixing to Ambisonic format as a strong and promising approach to neural upmixing. A discussion on limitations is also provided.</description>

      <title>A Near-Real-Time Processing Ego Speech Filtering Pipeline Designed for Speech Interruption During Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With current state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, it is not possible to transcribe overlapping speech audio streams separately. Consequently, when these ASR systems are used as part of a social robot like Pepper for interaction with a human, it is common practice to close the robot's microphone while it is talking itself. This prevents the human users to interrupt the robot, which limits speech-based human-robot interaction. To enable a more natural interaction which allows for such interruptions, we propose an audio processing pipeline for filtering out robot's ego speech using only a single-channel microphone. This pipeline takes advantage of the possibility to feed the robot ego speech signal, generated by a text-to-speech API, as training data into a machine learning model. The proposed pipeline combines a convolutional neural network and spectral subtraction to extract overlapping human speech from the audio recorded by the robot-embedded microphone. When evaluating on a held-out test set, we find that this pipeline outperforms our previous approach to this task, as well as state-of-the-art target speech extraction systems that were retrained on the same dataset. We have also integrated the proposed pipeline into a lightweight robot software development framework to make it available for broader use. As a step towards demonstrating the feasibility of deploying our pipeline, we use this framework to evaluate the effectiveness of the pipeline in a small lab-based feasibility pilot using the social robot Pepper. Our results show that when participants interrupt the robot, the pipeline can extract the participant's speech from one-second streaming audio buffers received by the robot-embedded single-channel microphone, hence in near-real time.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Real-World Polyphonic Piano Audio-to-Score Transcription with Hierarchical Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piano audio-to-score transcription (A2S) is an important yet underexplored task with extensive applications for music composition, practice, and analysis. However, existing end-to-end piano A2S systems faced difficulties in retrieving bar-level information such as key and time signatures, and have been trained and evaluated with only synthetic data. To address these limitations, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with a hierarchical decoder that aligns with the hierarchical structure of musical scores, enabling the transcription of score information at both the bar and note levels by multi-task learning. To bridge the gap between synthetic data and recordings of human performance, we propose a two-stage training scheme, which involves pre-training the model using an expressive performance rendering (EPR) system on synthetic audio, followed by fine-tuning the model using recordings of human performance. To preserve the voicing structure for score reconstruction, we propose a pre-processing method for **Kern scores in scenarios with an unconstrained number of voices. Experimental results support the effectiveness of our proposed approaches, in terms of both transcription performance on synthetic audio data in comparison to the current state-of-the-art, and the first experiment on human recordings.</description>

Abstract: Audio tagging is an important task of mapping audio samples to their corresponding categories. Recently endeavours that exploit transformer models in this field have achieved great success. However, the quadratic self-attention cost limits the scaling of audio transformer models and further constrains the development of more universal audio models. In this paper, we attempt to solve this problem by proposing Audio Mamba, a self-attention-free approach that captures long audio spectrogram dependency with state space models. Our experimental results on two audio-tagging datasets demonstrate the parameter efficiency of Audio Mamba, it achieves comparable results to SOTA audio spectrogram transformers with one third parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timbre, the sound's unique "color", is fundamental to how we perceive and appreciate music. This review explores the multifaceted world of timbre perception and representation. It begins by tracing the word's origin, offering an intuitive grasp of the concept. Building upon this foundation, the article delves into the complexities of defining and measuring timbre. It then explores the concept and techniques of timbre space, a powerful tool for visualizing how we perceive different timbres. The review further examines recent advancements in timbre manipulation and representation, including the increasingly utilized machine learning techniques. While the underlying neural mechanisms remain partially understood, the article discusses current neuroimaging techniques used to investigate this aspect of perception. Finally, it summarizes key takeaways, identifies promising future research directions, and emphasizes the potential applications of timbre research in music technology, assistive technologies, and our overall understanding of auditory perception.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Diffusion Transformer with Mixture of Noise Levels for Audiovisual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training diffusion models for audiovisual sequences allows for a range of generation tasks by learning conditional distributions of various input-output combinations of the two modalities. Nevertheless, this strategy often requires training a separate model for each task which is expensive. Here, we propose a novel training approach to effectively learn arbitrary conditional distributions in the audiovisual space.Our key contribution lies in how we parameterize the diffusion timestep in the forward diffusion process. Instead of the standard fixed diffusion timestep, we propose applying variable diffusion timesteps across the temporal dimension and across modalities of the inputs. This formulation offers flexibility to introduce variable noise levels for various portions of the input, hence the term mixture of noise levels. We propose a transformer-based audiovisual latent diffusion model and show that it can be trained in a task-agnostic fashion using our approach to enable a variety of audiovisual generation tasks at inference time. Experiments demonstrate the versatility of our method in tackling cross-modal and multimodal interpolation tasks in the audiovisual space. Notably, our proposed approach surpasses baselines in generating temporally and perceptually consistent samples conditioned on the input. Project page: avdit2024.github.io</description>

      <title>Self-Taught Recognizer: Toward Unsupervised Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised adaptation framework, Self-TAught Recognizer (STAR), which leverages unlabeled data to enhance the robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in diverse target domains, such as noise and accents. STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Sound Field from the Perspective of Band-Limited Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the frequency-domain sound field is regarded as an element of some band-limited function space, and a representation of the field as a linear combination of the reproducing kernel in that space is proposed. This model has the strongest representational capacity of all function systems when we know only the sound pressure information at arbitrary positions. The proposed model can be considered a generalization of the existing three-dimensional sound field model using the reproducing kernel of the solution space of the Helmholtz equation to the spatial dimension. One of the advantages of capturing the frequency-domain sound field in this way is the simplicity achieved for the estimation formula of the wavenumber spectrum. Two numerical simulations were conducted to validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>End-to-End User-Defined Keyword Spotting using Shifted Delta Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying user-defined keywords is crucial for personalizing interactions with smart devices. Previous approaches of user-defined keyword spotting (UDKWS) have relied on short-term spectral features such as mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) to detect the spoken keyword. However, these features may face challenges in accurately identifying closely related pronunciation of audio-text pairs, due to their limited capability in capturing the temporal dynamics of the speech signal. To address this challenge, we propose to use shifted delta coefficients (SDC) which help in capturing pronunciation variability (transition between connecting phonemes) by incorporating long-term temporal information. The performance of the SDC feature is compared with various baseline features across four different datasets using a cross-attention based end-to-end system. Additionally, various configurations of SDC are explored to find the suitable temporal context for the UDKWS task. The experimental results reveal that the SDC feature outperforms the MFCC baseline feature, exhibiting an improvement of 8.32% in area under the curve (AUC) and 8.69% in terms of equal error rate (EER) on the challenging Libriphrase-hard dataset. Moreover, the proposed approach demonstrated superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art UDKWS techniques.</description>

      <title>Visual Echoes: A Simple Unified Transformer for Audio-Visual Generation</title>

Abstract: In recent years, with the realistic generation results and a wide range of personalized applications, diffusion-based generative models gain huge attention in both visual and audio generation areas. Compared to the considerable advancements of text2image or text2audio generation, research in audio2visual or visual2audio generation has been relatively slow. The recent audio-visual generation methods usually resort to huge large language model or composable diffusion models. Instead of designing another giant model for audio-visual generation, in this paper we take a step back showing a simple and lightweight generative transformer, which is not fully investigated in multi-modal generation, can achieve excellent results on image2audio generation. The transformer operates in the discrete audio and visual Vector-Quantized GAN space, and is trained in the mask denoising manner. After training, the classifier-free guidance could be deployed off-the-shelf achieving better performance, without any extra training or modification. Since the transformer model is modality symmetrical, it could also be directly deployed for audio2image generation and co-generation. In the experiments, we show that our simple method surpasses recent image2audio generation methods.

      <title>Leveraging Electric Guitar Tones and Effects to Improve Robustness in Guitar Tablature Transcription Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription (GTT) aims at automatically generating symbolic representations from real solo guitar performances. Due to its applications in education and musicology, GTT has gained traction in recent years. However, GTT robustness has been limited due to the small size of available datasets. Researchers have recently used synthetic data that simulates guitar performances using pre-recorded or computer-generated tones and can be automatically generated at large scales. The present study complements these efforts by demonstrating that GTT robustness can be improved by including synthetic training data created using recordings of real guitar tones played with different audio effects. We evaluate our approach on a new evaluation dataset with professional solo guitar performances that we composed and collected, featuring a wide array of tones, chords, and scales.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Integration of Speech Separation and Voice Activity Detection for Low-Latency Diarization of Telephone Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works show that speech separation guided diarization (SSGD) is an increasingly promising direction, mainly thanks to the recent progress in speech separation. It performs diarization by first separating the speakers and then applying voice activity detection (VAD) on each separated stream. In this work we conduct an in-depth study of SSGD in the conversational telephone speech (CTS) domain, focusing mainly on low-latency streaming diarization applications. We consider three state-of-the-art speech separation (SSep) algorithms and study their performance both in online and offline scenarios, considering non-causal and causal implementations as well as continuous SSep (CSS) windowed inference. We compare different SSGD algorithms on two widely used CTS datasets: CALLHOME and Fisher Corpus (Part 1 and 2) and evaluate both separation and diarization performance. To improve performance, a novel, causal and computationally efficient leakage removal algorithm is proposed, which significantly decreases false alarms. We also explore, for the first time, fully end-to-end SSGD integration between SSep and VAD modules. Crucially, this enables fine-tuning on real-world data for which oracle speakers sources are not available. In particular, our best model achieves 8.8% DER on CALLHOME, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art end-to-end neural diarization model, despite being trained on an order of magnitude less data and having significantly lower latency, i.e., 0.1 vs. 1 s. Finally, we also show that the separated signals can be readily used also for automatic speech recognition, reaching performance close to using oracle sources in some configurations.</description>

      <title>Mamba in Speech: Towards an Alternative to Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer and its derivatives have achieved success in diverse tasks across computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing. To reduce the complexity of computations within the multi-head self-attention mechanism in Transformer, Selective State Space Models (i.e., Mamba) were proposed as an alternative. Mamba exhibited its effectiveness in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, but its superiority has rarely been investigated in speech signal processing. This paper explores solutions for applying Mamba to speech processing using two typical speech processing tasks: speech recognition, which requires semantic and sequential information, and speech enhancement, which focuses primarily on sequential patterns. The results exhibit the superiority of bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) for speech processing to vanilla Mamba. Moreover, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiMamba as an alternative to the self-attention module in Transformer and its derivates, particularly for the semantic-aware task. The crucial technologies for transferring Mamba to speech are then summarized in ablation studies and the discussion section to offer insights for future research.</description>

      <title>DistriBlock: Identifying adversarial audio samples by leveraging characteristics of the output distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17000v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks can mislead automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems into predicting an arbitrary target text, thus posing a clear security threat. To prevent such attacks, we propose DistriBlock, an efficient detection strategy applicable to any ASR system that predicts a probability distribution over output tokens in each time step. We measure a set of characteristics of this distribution: the median, maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution, as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the distributions of the subsequent time step. Then, by leveraging the characteristics observed for both benign and adversarial data, we apply binary classifiers, including simple threshold-based classification, ensembles of such classifiers, and neural networks. Through extensive analysis across different state-of-the-art ASR systems and language data sets, we demonstrate the supreme performance of this approach, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing target adversarial examples against clean and noisy data of 99% and 97%, respectively. To assess the robustness of our method, we show that adaptive adversarial examples that can circumvent DistriBlock are much noisier, which makes them easier to detect through filtering and creates another avenue for preserving the system's robustness.</description>

      <title>Advancing African-Accented Speech Recognition: Epistemic Uncertainty-Driven Data Selection for Generalizable ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02105v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accents play a pivotal role in shaping human communication, enhancing our ability to convey and comprehend messages with clarity and cultural nuance. While there has been significant progress in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), African-accented English ASR has been understudied due to a lack of training datasets, which are often expensive to create and demand colossal human labor. Combining several active learning paradigms and the core-set approach, we propose a new multi-rounds adaptation process that uses epistemic uncertainty to automate the annotation process, significantly reducing the associated costs and human labor. This novel method streamlines data annotation and strategically selects data samples that contribute most to model uncertainty, thereby enhancing training efficiency. We define a new metric called U-WER to track model adaptation to hard accents. We evaluate our approach across several domains, datasets, and high-performing speech models. Our results show that our approach leads to a 69.44\% WER improvement while requiring on average 45\% less data than established baselines. Our approach also improves out-of-distribution generalization for very low-resource accents, demonstrating its viability for building generalizable ASR models in the context of accented African ASR.

      <title>CompA: Addressing the Gap in Compositional Reasoning in Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental characteristic of audio is its compositional nature. Audio-language models (ALMs) trained using a contrastive approach (e.g., CLAP) that learns a shared representation between audio and language modalities have improved performance in many downstream applications, including zero-shot audio classification, audio retrieval, etc. However, the ability of these models to effectively perform compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored and necessitates additional research. In this paper, we propose CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks with a majority of real-world audio samples, to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Our proposed CompA-order evaluates how well an ALM understands the order or occurrence of acoustic events in audio, and CompA-attribute evaluates attribute-binding of acoustic events. An instance from either benchmark consists of two audio-caption pairs, where both audios have the same acoustic events but with different compositions. An ALM is evaluated on how well it matches the right audio to the right caption. Using this benchmark, we first show that current ALMs perform only marginally better than random chance, thereby struggling with compositional reasoning. Next, we propose CompA-CLAP, where we fine-tune CLAP using a novel learning method to improve its compositional reasoning abilities. To train CompA-CLAP, we first propose improvements to contrastive training with composition-aware hard negatives, allowing for more focused training. Next, we propose a novel modular contrastive loss that helps the model learn fine-grained compositional understanding and overcomes the acute scarcity of openly available compositional audios. CompA-CLAP significantly improves over all our baseline models on the CompA benchmark, indicating its superior compositional reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Detecting music deepfakes is easy but actually hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the face of a new era of generative models, the detection of artificially generated content has become a matter of utmost importance. The ability to create credible minute-long music deepfakes in a few seconds on user-friendly platforms poses a real threat of fraud on streaming services and unfair competition to human artists. This paper demonstrates the possibility (and surprising ease) of training classifiers on datasets comprising real audio and fake reconstructions, achieving a convincing accuracy of 99.8%. To our knowledge, this marks the first publication of a music deepfake detector, a tool that will help in the regulation of music forgery. Nevertheless, informed by decades of literature on forgery detection in other fields, we stress that a good test score is not the end of the story. We step back from the straightforward ML framework and expose many facets that could be problematic with such a deployed detector: calibration, robustness to audio manipulation, generalisation to unseen models, interpretability and possibility for recourse. This second part acts as a position for future research steps in the field and a caveat to a flourishing market of fake content checkers.</description>
