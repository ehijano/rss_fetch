      <title>Integrating granular data into a multilayer network: an interbank model of the euro area for systemic risk assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-structural models of contagion and systemic risk emphasize that shock propagation is inherently multi-channel, spanning counterparty exposures, short-term funding and roll-over risk, securities cross-holdings, and common-asset (fire-sale) spillovers. Empirical implementations, however, often rely on stylized or simulated networks, or focus on a single exposure dimension, reflecting the practical difficulty of reconciling heterogeneous granular collections into a coherent representation with consistent identifiers and consolidation rules. We close part of this gap by constructing an empirically grounded multilayer network for euro area significant banking groups that integrates several supervisory and statistical datasets into layer-consistent exposure matrices defined on a common node set. Each layer corresponds to a distinct transmission channel, long- and short-term credit, securities cross-holdings, short-term secured funding, and overlapping external portfolios, and nodes are enriched with balance-sheet information to support model calibration. We document pronounced cross-layer heterogeneity in connectivity and centrality, and show that an aggregated (flattened) representation can mask economically relevant structure and misidentify the institutions that are systemically important in specific markets. We then illustrate how the resulting network disciplines standard systemic-risk analytics by implementing a centrality-based propagation measure and a micro-structural agent-based framework on real exposures. The approach provides a data-grounded basis for layer-aware systemic-risk assessment and stress testing across multiple dimensions of the banking network.</description>

      <title>When Fusion Helps and When It Breaks: View-Aligned Robustness in Same-Source Financial Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study same-source multi-view learning and adversarial robustness for next-day direction prediction with financial image representations. On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.</description>

      <title>Predictive AI with External Knowledge Infusion: Datasets and Benchmarks for Stock Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations in stock prices are influenced by a complex interplay of factors that go beyond mere historical data. These factors, themselves influenced by external forces, encompass inter-stock dynamics, broader economic factors, various government policy decisions, outbreaks of wars, etc. Furthermore, all of these factors are dynamic and exhibit changes over time. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle the forecasting problem under external influence by proposing learning mechanisms that not only learn from historical trends but also incorporate external knowledge from temporal knowledge graphs. Since there are no such datasets or temporal knowledge graphs available, we study this problem with stock market data, and we construct comprehensive temporal knowledge graph datasets. In our proposed approach, we model relations on external temporal knowledge graphs as events of a Hawkes process on graphs. With extensive experiments, we show that learned dynamic representations effectively rank stocks based on returns across multiple holding periods, outperforming related baselines on relevant metrics.</description>
