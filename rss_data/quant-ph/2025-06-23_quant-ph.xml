      <title>Quantum Fisher-Preconditioned Reinforcement Learning: From Single-Qubit Control to Rayleigh-Fading Link Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose Quantum-Preconditioned Policy Gradient (QPPG), a natural gradient-based algorithm for link adaptation that whitens policy updates using the full inverse quantum Fisher information with Tikhonov regularization. QPPG bridges classical and quantum geometry, achieving stable learning even under noise. Evaluated on classical and quantum environments, including noisy single-qubit Gym tasks and Rayleigh-fading channels, QPPG converges 4 times faster than REINFORCE and sustains a 1 dB gain under uncertainty. It reaches a 90 percent return in one hundred episodes with high noise robustness, showcasing the advantages of full QFI-based preconditioning for scalable quantum reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the compilation, optimization, and error mitigation of quantum algorithms, essential steps to execute real-world quantum algorithms. Quantum algorithms running on a hybrid platform with QPU and CPU/GPU take advantage of existing high-performance computing power with quantum-enabled exponential speedups. The proposed approximate quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) for quantum algorithm optimization improves the circuit execution on top of an exponential speed-ups the quantum Fourier transform has provided.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Qubit Readout Using Next-Generation Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck. Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation, adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets, respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a leading technique for understanding structural changes in advanced battery materials such as lithium-excess cathodes. However, extracting critical information like oxidation states from the experimental spectra requires expensive and time-consuming simulations. Building upon a recent proposal to simulate XAS using quantum computers, this work proposes a highly-optimized implementation of the time-domain algorithm for X-ray absorption. Among a host of improvements to Hamiltonian representation, circuit implementation, and measurement strategies, three optimizations are key to the efficiency of the algorithm. The first is the use of product formulas with the compressed double factorized form of the Hamiltonian. The second is recognizing that for spectroscopy applications, it is sufficient to control the error in the eigenvalues of the (approximate) Hamiltonian being implemented by the product formula, rather than the generic error on the full time evolution operator. Using perturbation theory to estimate this eigenvalue error, we find that significantly fewer Trotter steps are needed than expected from the time evolution error bound. The third is the choice of an optimized distribution of samples that takes advantage of the exponentially decaying Lorentzian kernel. Through constant factor resource estimates, we show that a challenging model Li$_4$Mn$_2$O cluster system with 18 spatial orbitals and 22 electrons in the active space can be simulated with 100 logical qubits and less than $4 \times 10^8$ T gates per circuit. Finally, the algorithm is implemented on a simulator, and the reconstructed spectrum is verified against a classical computational reference. The low cost of our algorithm makes it attractive to use on fault-tolerant quantum devices to accelerate the development and commercialization of high-capacity battery cathodes.</description>

      <title>Theory and Experimental Demonstration of Quantum Invariant Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum control protocols are typically devised in the time domain, leaving their spectral behavior to emerge only a posteriori. Here, we invert this paradigm. Starting from a target frequency-domain filter, we employ the dynamical-invariant framework to derive the continuous driving fields that enact the chosen spectral response on a qubit. This approach, Quantum Invariant Filtering (QIF), maps arbitrary finite-impulse responses, including multi-band and phase-sensitive profiles, into experimentally feasible Hamiltonian modulations. Implemented on a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, the method realizes the prescribed passbands with high fidelity, suppresses noise, and preserves coherence for milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer than Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences, while remaining robust to 50% drive-amplitude errors. Our results establish QIF as a broadly applicable framework for enhanced quantum control and sensing across diverse physical platforms, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and nuclear magnetic resonance systems.</description>

      <title>Strategies for generating separable photon triplets in waveguides and ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral correlations of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize them. We propose two strategies to minimize spectral correlations: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber taper and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Parallelized projective measurements for spatial photonic qudits estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum state tomography method that enables the reconstruction of \emph{arbitrary} $d-$dimensional quantum states encoded in the discretized transverse momentum of photons, by using \emph{only} $d+1$ experimental settings. To this end, we identify a family of bases with the property that the outcomes of a projective measurement are \emph{spatially multiplexed} on the interference pattern of the projected state. Using the proposed scheme we performed, as a proof-of-principle, an experimental reconstruction of $d=6-$dimensional states, for which a complete set of mutually unbiased bases does not exist. We obtained fidelity values above 0.97 for both pure and mixed states, reducing the number of experimental settings from $42$ to only $7$.</description>

      <title>Transversal Gates for Highly Asymmetric qLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transversal gates are the ideal gates in a fault-tolerant scenario; relatively easy to implement, and minimally error propagating. Their availability will maximise fault tolerant thresholds, enabling universal quantum computation in a wider range of noisy hardware.
  Transversal gates in quantum low density parity check (qLDPC) codes are largely unstudied, with the early results of Burton &amp; Browne suggesting that transversal non-Clifford gates may be impossible. In this paper, we contradict this expectation with constructions for both hypergraph product codes and balanced product codes, although these first examples have weak properties. We find qLDPC codes with transversal phase gates that have a number of logical qubits that grows linearly with $n$, the number of physical qubits. The distance is highly asymmetric; while the distance against bit flip errors also grows (almost) linearly in $n$, the distance against phase flip errors is limited to $O(1)$. Moreover, existing distance rebalancing techniques are one-sided; we show that they only preserve the transversality when rebalancing to increase the asymmetry, not decrease it.
  We also collate a toolbox of techniques that identify a single transversal gate from which we can individuate a large range of different transversal gates. This is critical when addressing the question of what a transversal phase gate truly means when there are many logical qubits in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging disciplines has led to incredible learnings and breakthroughs throughout history, including the discovery of quantum computing: a cross between computation and quantum physics. In this paper, I will discuss how we can cross quantum computing with topics in fundamental physics. This leads to fruitful, interactive learning opportunities that fuse deep open physics problems with key insights about quantum information science. By outlining quantum circuit experiments that can be run on current and near-term quantum computers, I demonstrate how to help learners engage with principles in special relativity, general relativity and thermodynamics. In turn, these connections can advance their understanding of quantum computing. Learners can further explore the quantum computing activities in this paper via the Quantum Paradoxes content series of videos, blogs and code tutorials that I created with IBM Quantum.</description>

      <title>A Qubit as a Bridge Between Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a unified perspective on thermal equilibrium and quantum dynamics by examining the simplest quantum system, a qubit, as a foundational model. We show that both the thermal partition function and the Loschmidt amplitude can be understood as extensions of a single analytic function along different paths in the complex plane. The zeros of Loschmidt amplitude encode dynamical features such as orthogonality, rate function singularities, and quantum speed limits, in analogy with the role of partition function zeros in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We further establish, through the Cauchy-Riemann equations, that the high-temperature specific heat corresponds to early-time evolution. The discussion follows a pedagogical progression from a single qubit to an interacting spin chain.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Signal Quantum Circuit Design for Option Pricing Using Design Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior studies have largely focused on quantum algorithms, often reducing parallel computing designs to abstract models or overly simplified circuits. This has contributed to the misconception that most applications are feasible only through VLSI circuits and cannot be implemented using quantum circuits. To challenge this view, we present a mixed-signal quantum circuit framework incorporating three novel methods that reduce circuit complexity and improve noise tolerance. In a 12 qubit case study comparing our design with JP Morgan's option pricing circuit, we reduced the gate count from 4095 to 392, depth from 2048 to 6, and error rate from 25.86\% to 1.64\%. Our design combines analog simplicity with digital flexibility and synthesizability, demonstrating that quantum circuits can effectively leverage classical VLSI techniques, such as those enabled by Synopsys Design Compiler to address current quantum design limitations.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in a dynamical decoupling process by parity kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a simple quantitative relationship between the environmental memory effects and the characteristics in a dynamical decoupling process. In contrast to previous works, our measures of non-Markovianity are tailored and extended to evaluate the strength of memory effects in dynamical decoupling. We find that if each kick commutes with the dynamical map of the uncontrolled system, then the change of the final dynamical map or the final state brought by the control (called the "effect of control") is upper (lower) bounded by the summation (difference) of the strengths of memory effects with and without control. Our finding is illustrated with a dissipative quantum Rabi model by numerical simulations where one or many cycles of parity kicks are implemented on the qubit. Besides, the results show that under certain conditions, the effect of control or the increase of performance by the control may be simply proportional to the strength of memory effects with or without control.</description>

      <title>Quantum state smoothing when Alice assumes the wrong type of monitoring by Bob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open quantum system leaks information into its environment. In some circumstances it is possible for an observer, say Alice, to recover that information, as a classical measurement record, in a variety of different ways, using different experimental setups. The optimal way for Alice to estimate the quantum state at time $t$ from the record before $t$ is known as quantum filtering. Recently, a version of quantum smoothing, in which Alice estimates the state at time $t$ using her record on both sides of $t$, has been developed. It requires Alice to make optimal inferences about the pre-$t$ record of a second observer, say Bob, who recovers whatever information Alice does not. But for Alice to make this inference, she needs to know Bob's setup. In this paper we consider what happens if Alice is mistaken in her assumption about Bob's setup. We show that the accuracy -- as measured by the Trace-Squared-Deviation, of Alice's estimate of the true state (i.e., the state conditioned on her and Bob's pre-$t$ records) -- depends strongly on her setup, Bob's actual setup, and the wrongly assumed setup. Using resonance fluorescence as a model system, we show numerically that in some cases the wrong smoothing is almost as accurate as the right smoothing, but in other cases much less accurate, even being less accurate than Alice's filtered estimate. Curiously, in some of the latter cases the fidelity of Alice's wrong estimate with the true state is actually higher than that of her right estimate. We explain this, and other features we observe numerically, by some simple analytical arguments.</description>

      <title>No-go theorems for sublinear-depth group designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing ensembles of circuits which efficiently approximate the Haar measure over various groups is a long-standing and fundamental problem in quantum information theory. Recently it was shown that one can obtain approximate designs over the unitary group with depths scaling logarithmically in the number of qubits, but that no sublinear-depth approximate designs exist over the orthogonal group. Here we derive, for any group $G$ possessing an invariant state $G^{\otimes k} \lvert\Psi\rangle= \lvert\Psi\rangle$, a lower bound on the diamond distance between the $k$\textsuperscript{th} moment operator of any ensemble of elements of $G$, and that of the Haar measure over $G$. We then use this bound to prove that for many groups of interest, no subset of $G$ consisting of sublinear-depth one-dimensional circuits with local gates can form an approximate $k$-design over $G$. More generally, on a $D$-dimensional lattice, our results imply that such group designs require depths scaling at least as $n^{1/D}$. Moreover, for most of the groups we consider we find that such ensembles can, with high probability, be distinguished from $k$-designs by a single shot of a constant-depth measurement. Among other examples, we show that there is a constant separation between (a) the maximum depth and gate count for which no circuit can approximate even the second moment of random matchgate circuits, and (b) the depth and gate count required to implement the matchgate Haar distribution exactly. We furthermore rule out the existence of sublinear-depth $8$-designs over the Clifford group. Finally, we relax the assumption of working with local gates, and prove the impossibility of obtaining approximate designs over $G$ using any circuit comprised of a sublinear number of gates generated by Pauli strings.</description>

      <title>Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group for \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group (CA-DMRG) method seamlessly integrates Clifford circuits with matrix product states, and takes advantage of the expression power from both. CA-DMRG has been shown to be able to achieve higher accuracy than standard DMRG on commonly used lattice models, with only moderate computational overhead compared to the latter. In this work, we propose an efficient scheme in CA-DMRG to deal with \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry Hamiltonians, and apply it to study several molecular systems. Our numerical results show that CA-DMRG can reach several orders of magnitude higher accuracy than DMRG using the same bond dimension, pointing out a promising route to push the boundary of solving \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry with strong static correlations.</description>

      <title>Observation of photonic dynamics in dissipative quantum Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model (QRM), composed of a qubit interacting with a quantized photonic field, is a cornerstone of quantum optics. The QRM with dominant unitary dynamics has been demonstrated in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems, but an open QRM with a strong photonic dissipation has not been experimentally explored. We here present the first experimental demonstration of such an open system in circuit QED, featuring a controlled competition between the coherent qubit-field interaction and the photonic dissipation. We map out the photon number distributions of the dissipative resonator for different coupling strengths in the steady state. We further observe the variation of the photon number during the system's evolution toward the steady state with fixed control parameters. The results demonstrate that the system's behavior is significantly modified by photonic dissipation.</description>

      <title>Single-shot high-resolution spectroscopy of single-photon-level optical pulses using a virtually imaged phased-array and single-photon avalanche diode array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot high-resolution spectroscopy at the single-photon-level has emerged as a promising measurement technique, enabling novel observations and evaluations that were previously challenging. This technology is particularly effective for spectroscopic applications aimed at realizing frequency-multiplexed quantum repeaters. In this study, we propose a single-shot high-resolution single-photon spectroscopy system that integrates high-resolution frequency-to-spatial mode mapping using a virtually imaged phased-array (VIPA) and high-precision spatial mode detection using a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array. We experimentally demonstrated the principle of this system using weak coherent pulses with a frequency mode interval of 120 MHz. This interval closely matches the minimum frequency mode spacing of the atomic frequency comb quantum memory with the $Pr^{3+}$-ion-doped $Y_{2}SiO_{5}$ crystal. By applying the proposed system, we expect to maximize the multiplexing capability of frequency-multiplexed quantum repeater schemes utilizing such quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Fully convolutional 3D neural network decoders for surface codes with syndrome circuit noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a promising approach to the decoding problem of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), but have observed consistent difficulty when generalising performance to larger QEC codes. Recent scalability-focused approaches have split the decoding workload by using local ANNs to perform initial syndrome processing and leaving final processing to a global residual decoder. We investigated ANN surface code decoding under a scheme exploiting the spatiotemporal structure of syndrome data. In particular, we present a vectorised method for surface code data simulation and benchmark decoding performance when such data defines a multi-label classification problem and generative modelling problem for rotated surface codes with circuit noise after each gate and idle timestep. Performance was found to generalise to rotated surface codes of sizes up to $d=97$, with depolarisation parameter thresholds of up to $0.7\%$ achieved, competitive with h Minimum Weight Perfect Matching
  (MWPM). Improved latencies, compared with MWPM alone, were found starting at code distances of $d=33$ and $d=89$ under noise models above and below threshold respectively. These results suggest promising prospects for ANN-based frameworks for surface code decoding with performance sufficient to support the demands expected from fault-tolerant resource estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of quantum heat transport, based on the quadratic fermionic systems with help of the Peschel trick of single-particle correlation functions. The efficient numerical method is applied to the particular case of a single mode heat valve and the results are compared to analytical formulae. Comparing several configurations and parameters we perform the systematic analysis of the method to most efficiently and accurately describe the simple quantum heat valve system.</description>

      <title>Slit-loaded coplanar waveguide for color-center spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin qubits of color centers are extensively investigated for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing, with their states generally controlled using lasers and microwaves. However, it is challenging to effectively irradiate both lasers and microwaves onto color centers using small footprint microwave waveguides or antennas that are compatible with semiconductor devices. We experimentally show that by introducing a compact coplanar waveguide with a thin slit in its signal line, effective irradiation of both lasers and microwaves is enabled, allowing spin-state control of color centers created around the slit. Microwave magnetic fields parallel to the surface, intrinsically generated by a standard coplanar waveguide, persist even after loading the slit, which is necessary to control the color centers whose spin quantization axes are oriented perpendicular to the surface, while laser light for the initialization and readout of spin states can access the color centers through the slit. Continuous and pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance measurements are performed for the silicon vacancies ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) in silicon carbide 4H-SiC(0001). Experimental results indicate that the spin states of $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ are effectively controlled by the microwave magnetic fields parallel to the surface, which agrees with numerical results from electromagnetic field simulations. Our small footprint waveguide is suitable for integrating color-center-based quantum sensors into semiconductor electronic devices and other small-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of criticality-enhanced quantum sensing in non-unitary quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum physics with its unique features enables parameter estimation with precisions beyond the capability of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving such an enhancement. Despite immense theoretical progress in characterizing criticality-enhanced sensing, experimental implementations of such systems have been extremely challenging. This is due to the complexity of ground-state preparation and the long time required to reach the steady state near the critical points. Here we experimentally demonstrate criticality-enhanced quantum sensitivity in a non-Hermitian topological system. Our photonic quantum walk setup supports two distinct topological phase transitions at which quantum-enhanced sensitivity is observed even at the transient times, where the system has not yet reached its steady state. Indeed, our theoretical analysis shows that the detected enhancement is a direct implication of the steady-state behavior. The merit of our setup is also captured through Bayesian inference which shows excellent estimation and precision. Our experiment showcases the leveraging of quantum criticality and non-Hermitian physics for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Full-stack Analog Optical Quantum Computer with A Hundred Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical technology emerges as a highly promising platform for quantum computing, driven by its enormous potential for large-scale ultrafast computation and its integration with telecom technology. There have been intensive investigations ongoing into the development of optical quantum computers, however, they are limited to small-scale, special-purpose, or low-quality systems. Error correction for fault tolerance is still very challenging, making a full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer a long-term goal. However, practical testbeds for quantum computers, without the difficulty in error correction, are in high demand. Here we present an innovative analog optical quantum computer utilising continuous variables. Our analog optical quantum computer is based on sequential measurements of time-domain-multiplexed large-scale two-dimensional entanglement. Accumulated Gaussian noise and spurious bias caused by the imperfection of analog computing can be suppressed through careful calibration and repeated trials without complicated error correction. Our system achieves a hundred analog inputs and operates at a clock frequency of 100 MHz with a comprehensive full-stack architecture featuring a cloud interface and a Python software development kit (SDK) for enhanced accessibility and scalability. We demonstrate the detailed characterisation of our optical quantum computer and quantum state sorting as its example application. This development marks a significant step forward in the exploration of analog quantum computing, with a potential to accelerate both fundamental research and practical applications such as fast and large-scale optical neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the field of multilevel quantum batteries, we present the model of a quantum device for energy storage with anharmonic level spacing, based on a superconducting circuit in the transmon regime. It is charged via the sequential interaction with a collection of identical and independent ancillary two-level systems. By means of a numerical analysis we show that, in case these ancillas are coherent, this kind of quantum battery can achieve remarkable performances for what it concerns the control of the stored energy and its extraction in regimes of parameters within reach in nowadays quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a disruptive technology with the potential to transform various fields. It has predicted abilities to solve complex computational problems beyond the reach of classical computers. However, developing quantum software faces significant challenges. Quantum hardware is yet limited in size and unstable with errors and noise. A shortage of skilled developers and a lack of standardization delay adoption. Quantum hardware is in the process of maturing and is constantly changing its characteristics rendering algorithm design increasingly complex, requiring innovative solutions. Project "Towards reliable quantum software development: Approaches and use-cases" TORQS has studied the dilemma of reliable software development and potential for quantum computing for Finnish industries from multidisciplinary points of views. Here we condense the main observations and results of the project into an essay roadmap and timeline for investing in quantum software, algorithms, hardware, and business.</description>

      <title>Graph-Cover-based Characterization of the Bethe Partition Function of Double-Edge Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For standard factor graphs (S-FGs) with non-negative real-valued local functions, Vontobel provided a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe approximation of the partition function, also known as the Bethe partition function, using finite graph covers. The proof of this characterization, i.e., the graph-cover theorem for S-FGs, heavily relied on the method of types.
  In this paper, we study double-edge factor graphs (DE-FGs), a class of factor graphs where each local function takes complex values and satisfies some positive semi-definiteness constraints. DE-FGs and their partition functions are particularly relevant for quantum information processing. Approximating the partition function of a DE-FG is more difficult than for an S-FG, as it involves summing complex values instead of non-negative real values. We develop the sum-product algorithm (SPA) fixed-point-based Bethe approximation of the partition function. However, one cannot directly apply the method of types to prove a similar combinatorial characterization as in the case of S-FGs.
  We provide a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of finite graph covers for a class of DE-FGs that satisfy a specific, easily checkable condition. Towards proving this characterization, we apply a suitable loop-calculus transform (LCT) to these graphs. Originally, the LCT was introduced by Chertkov and Chernyak as a special linear transform for S-FGs and later extended by Mori. Our proposed LCT is applicable for both DE-FGs and S-FGs and generalizes prior versions by handling zero-valued SPA fixed-point message components, which are common in DE-FGs.
  Supported by numerical results, we conjecture that this combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of finite graph covers holds more broadly for DE-FGs.</description>

      <title>Robust global tripartite entanglement in a mixed spin-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes $1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable. The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement, quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.</description>

      <title>A control of threshold of hard excitaion mode of optomechanical system by a low-intensity seed wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optomechanical system based on two optical modes, one of which is pumped by a coherent wave, interacting with each other via a phonon mode is considered. In such a system, a hard excitation mode can be realized in the region of bistability. It is demonstrated that excitation of an optical mode with a lower frequency by a low-intensity seed wave can lead to a significant reduction of a threshold of the hard excitation mode. This decrease is due to the fact that the seed wave changes the stability of solutions in the bistability region. This leads to the fact that switching from a non-generating state to a generating one occurs at lower values of the intensity of the pump wave. The obtained result paves the way for the creation of all-optical transistors and logical elements.</description>

      <title>The quantification of a genuine tetrapartite entanglement in a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genuine tetrapartite entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer is quantified according to the three different approaches incorporated all seven global bisections existing within the tetrapartite system. The degree of entanglement of each bisection is evaluated through the bipartite negativity at zero and non-zero temperature taking into account ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic type of intra- ($J$) and inter-dimer ($J_1$) exchange coupling inside the square plaquette. Three utilized quantification methods based on the generalization of (i) a genuine tripartite negativity, (ii) a Coffman, Kundu and Wootters monogamy relation and (iii) a geometric average of complete trisections, result to the qualitatively and almost quantitatively identical behavior of a genuine tetrapartite negativity. It is shown that the genuine tetrapartite negativity exclusively arises from the antiferromagnetic-inter dimer $J_1&gt;0$ coupling, whereas the character of with respect to $J$ ($J&gt;0$ or $J&lt;0$) determines its zero-temperature magnitude and its thermal stability with respect to the magnetic field and temperature. As is demonstrated for $0&lt;J_1/J&lt;1$ the genuine tetrapartite negativity is dramatically reduced due to the preference of magnetic arrangement involving two separable mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers. In an opposite limit the genuine tetrapartite negativity is significantly stable with a threshold temperature proportional to the strength of an inter-dimer coupling $J_1$. It is found, that all three quantification procedures are insufficient to correctly describe the genuine tetrapartite negativity in a specific part of the parameter space with absence of relevant dimer separable states. Finally, the thermal stability of a genuine tetrapartite negativity is discussed in detail for selected geometries motivated by the real tetranuclear bimetallic complexes with a Cu$_2$Ni$_2$ magnetic core.</description>

      <title>Effect of linear and nonlinear coupling processes on correlation properties of bosonic modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of the linear and nonlinear coupling processes on the correlation properties of a system composed of two bosonic modes. The coupling processes are treated as Gaussian while the modes are assumed to experience damping and fluctuations that are due to their coupling to independent squeezed vacua. We investigate under what circumstances a given type of coupling causes the creation of the first-order correlations and which causes the creation of the two-photon correlations. Distinctly different results are obtained for the linear and nonlinear couplings, especially when there are two-photon correlations present in the modes. In particular, the linear coupling process can generate the inter-mode correlations only when there are differences between the modes either in populations or two-photon correlations. The varying with the coupling strength a population difference is shown to be responsible for generation of the first-order correlations while the varying asymmetry in the two-photon correlations is found to be responsible for the generation of the inter-mode two-photon correlations. In the case of the nonlinear coupling the generation of the inter-mode correlations is insensitive to any difference between the modes. The varying with the coupling strength amplification of the population of the modes is found to be responsible for generation of the inter-mode two photon correlations while the varying amplification of the two-photon correlations results in the first-order correlations between the modes. Furthermore, in the strong coupling limit the linear coupling tends to destroy all of the inter-mode correlations, and simultaneously turns the states of the modes to be identical, either thermal or equally squeezed states. In the case of nonlinear coupling process the modes are turned to be perfectly coherent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Catalytic Space</title>

Abstract: Space complexity is a key field of study in theoretical computer science. In the quantum setting there are clear motivations to understand the power of space-restricted computation, as qubits are an especially precious and limited resource.
  Recently, a new branch of space-bounded complexity called catalytic computing has shown that reusing space is a very powerful computational resource, especially for subroutines that incur little to no space overhead. While quantum catalysis in an information theoretic context, and the power of ``dirty'' qubits for quantum computation, has been studied over the years, these models are generally not suitable for use in quantum space-bounded algorithms, as they either rely on specific catalytic states or destroy the memory being borrowed.
  We define the notion of catalytic computing in the quantum setting and show a number of initial results about the model. First, we show that quantum catalytic logspace can always be computed quantumly in polynomial time; the classical analogue of this is the largest open question in catalytic computing. This also allows quantum catalytic space to be defined in an equivalent way with respect to circuits instead of Turing machines. We also prove that quantum catalytic logspace can simulate log-depth threshold circuits, a class which is known to contain (and believed to strictly contain) quantum logspace, thus showcasing the power of quantum catalytic space. Finally we show that both unitary quantum catalytic logspace and classical catalytic logspace can be simulated in the one-clean qubit model.</description>

      <title>Feedback-driven recurrent quantum neural network universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing uses the dynamics of quantum systems to process temporal data, making it particularly well-suited for learning with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Early experimental proposals, such as the restarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the quantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time processing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have introduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include online, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable real-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the feedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information with comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the theoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain underdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the approximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class of existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting. We provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural networks, including approximation bounds and universality results. Notably, our analysis demonstrates that the model is universal with linear readouts, making it both powerful and experimentally accessible. These results pave the way for practical and theoretically grounded quantum reservoir computing with real-time processing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we design an advanced quantum readout architecture that integrates a four qubit superconducting chip with a novel parametric amplifier ended with analog front-end circuit. Unlike conventional approaches, this design eliminates the need for components such as Purcell filters. Instead, a Josephson Parametric Amplifier is engineered to simultaneously perform quantum-limited signal amplification and suppress qubit energy leakage. The design features a tailored gain profile across C-band, with sharp peaks (24 dB) and troughs (0 dB), enabling qubit frequencies to align with gain minima and resonator frequencies with gain maxima.</description>

      <title>Collision-assisted information scrambling on a configurable photonic chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference and entanglement are in the core of quantum computations. The fast spread of information in the quantum circuit helps to mitigate the circuit depth. Although the information scrambling in the closed systems has been proposed and tested in the digital circuits, how to measure the evolution of quantum correlations between systems and environments remains a delicate and open question. Here, we propose a photonic circuit to investigate the information scrambling in an open quantum system by implementing the collision model with cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We numerically simulate the photon propagation and find that the tripartite mutual information strongly depends on the system-environment and environment-environment interactions. We further reduce the number of observables and the number of shots required to reconstruct the density matrix by designing an enhanced compressed sensing. Our results provide a reconfigurable photonic platform for simulating open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring controllable dissipation and non-Markovianity in discrete-variable photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Stability of thermal equilibrium in long-range quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Levitodynamics: An analysis of quantum fluctuations based on stochastic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitodynamics, i.e., the levitation of objects of mesoscopic size has made huge progress in the last decade, giving rise to new experimental opportunities for instance in materials science, but also allowing to address questions of fundamental physics for the first time. It has become possible to cool a levitated particle of mesoscopic size down to its motional ground state and to observe its motion driven by quantum fluctuations. Such an experiment is ideally suited for an analysis within the stochastic mechanics approach to quantum mechanics, which allows for a dynamic description of individual particle paths. We show that within our approach we reproduce the findings of a recent experiment [Magrini et al., Nature 595-373-377 (2021)]. The phase space dynamics reported there based on a quantum optimal control using Kalman filtering can be understood using the concept of coherent states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a general quantum receiver protocol that maps laser-light-modulated classical communications signals into quantum processors for decoding with quantum logic. The quantum logic enables joint quantum measurements over a codeword. These joint measurements are needed to achieve the quantum limit of communications capacity. Our receiver design requires only logarithmically increasing qubit resources with the size of the codeword and accommodates practically relevant coherent-state modulation containing multiple photons per pulse. Focusing on classical-quantum polar codes, we outline the necessary quality of quantum operations and codeword lengths to demonstrate a quantum processing-enhanced communications rate surpassing that of any known classical optical receiver-decoder pair. Specifically, we show that a small quantum receiver of 4 qubits with loss rates of $\sim 2\%$ and quantum gate errors of $\sim 0.02\%$ can provide a $10$ percent gain in the communications rate in the weak signal limit. Additionally, we outline a possible hardware implementation of the receiver based on efficient spin-photon interfaces such as cavity-coupled diamond color centers or atomic qubits for which the required functionality has been experimentally verified, although not at the required error levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle in the real line I compile and contrast, starting with a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many amazing similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences. The basic reason for all of them is the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. It was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of his success at understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme which is consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify quantifications of them by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Error mitigation of shot-to-shot fluctuations in analog quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators have provided key insights into quantum many-body dynamics. However, in such systems, both coherent and incoherent errors limit their scalability, hindering simulations in regimes that challenge classical simulations. In this work, we introduce an error mitigation technique that addresses and effectively suppresses a key source of error in leading simulator platforms: shot-to-shot fluctuations in the parameters for the Hamiltonian governing the system dynamics. We rigorously prove that amplifying this shot-to-shot noise and extrapolating to the zero-noise limit recovers noiseless results for realistic noise distributions. Experimentally, we demonstrate this technique on a 27-ion trapped-ion quantum simulator, extending the two-qubit exchange oscillation lifetime threefold. Numerically, we predict a significant enhancement in the effective many-body coherence time for Rydberg atom arrays under realistic conditions. Our scheme provides a possible route towards extending the effective coherence time in analog quantum experiments, enabling deeper explorations of quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter systems that exhibit two-photon interactions have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring quantum applications. In this work, we focus on the two-photon Dicke model, a system of significant experimental relevance that displays spectral collapse and undergoes a phase transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.</description>

      <title>Operator-space fragmentation and integrability in Pauli-Lindblad models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation for open quantum systems is central to our understanding of coherence and entanglement in the presence of Markovian dissipation. In closed quantum systems Hilbert-space fragmentation is an effective mechanism for slowing decoherence in the presence of constrained interactions. We develop a general mechanism for operator-space fragmentation of mixed states, undergoing Lindbladian evolution generated by frustration-free Hamiltonians and Pauli-string jump operators. The interplay of generator algebras of dissipative and unitary dynamics leads to a hierarchical partitioning of operator and real space into dynamically disconnected subspaces, which we elucidate using the bond and commutant algebras of superoperators. This fragmentation fundamentally constrains information spreading in open systems and provides new mechanisms to control highly entangled quantum states and dynamics. Our approach yields two key advances. Firstly, we introduce frustration graphs in operator space as a compact representation to construct effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in individual fragments and diagnose their free-fermion solvability. Secondly, using these methods we uncover a range of universal dynamical regimes in Pauli-Lindblad models, exhibiting symmetry enriched quantum chaos and integrability in operator-space fragments. Furthermore, we show dissipation-driven phase transitions corresponding to exceptional points in the Lindbladian spectrum whose signatures are captured by spectral statistics and operator dynamics. These results establish operator-space fragmentation as a fundamental principle for open quantum systems, with immediate implications for quantum error correction, where protected subspaces could emerge naturally from fragmentation. Our framework provides a systematic approach to discover and characterize novel non-equilibrium phases in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QMetro++ is a Python package containing a set of tools dedicated to identifying optimal estimation protocols that maximize quantum Fisher information (QFI). Optimization can be performed for an arbitrary arrangement of input states, parameter encoding channels, noise correlations, control operations and measurements. The use of tensor networks and iterative see-saw algorithm allows for an efficient optimization even in the regime of large number of channel uses ($N\approx100$). Additionally, the package comes with an implementation of the recently developed methods for computing fundamental upper bounds on QFI, which serve as benchmarks of optimality of the outcomes of numerical optimization. All functionalities are wrapped up in a user-friendly interface which enables defining strategies at various levels of detail.</description>

      <title>All Or Nothing: No-Downfolding Theorems For Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of a quantum system with many degrees of freedom is often approximated by downfolding: most of the degrees of freedom are "folded into" a much smaller number of degrees of freedom, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian that still captures the essential physics. Approaches of this sort are particularly relevant for quantum information, where exact downfolding would allow eigenstates in a large Hilbert space to be simulated with fewer qubits. Very little work has been done to prove the existence of such an exact downfolding for general systems or even particular cases. In this letter we prove that exact quantum downfolding is impossible for what is perhaps the most commonly-used formulation of the task. Specifically, for a non-trivial Hamiltonian $\mathbf{H}(x)\equiv\mathbf{A}+x\mathbf{B}$ that depends on some parameter $x$ (e.g. an electric field, bond length or interaction strength) it is not possible to construct a lower-dimension effective Hamiltonian $\mathbf{h}(x)\equiv\mathbf{a}+x\mathbf{b}$ that exactly recovers \emph{any} of the eigenvalue functions $E_i(x)$ of $\mathbf{H}(x)$. We discuss several generalizations of this result and the impacts of these findings on future directions in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Qubit thermodynamics: Entropy production from nonadiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabaticity is a cornerstone of many promising approaches to quantum control, computing, and simulation. In practice, however, there is always a trade-off. Although the deleterious effects of noise can be diminished by running a control schedule more quickly, this benefit comes at the expense of nonadiabaticity. To put these two unwanted effects on the same theoretical footing, we analyze the nonadiabatic error in qubit control as a form of entropy production, examining the mechanism by which fine-grained information is effectively lost despite the dynamics being fundamentally unitary. A crucial issue here is the question of how to define equilibrium under a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Using the Landau--Zener protocol as a test case, we show that entropy increases nearly monotonically when equilibrium is defined with respect to the effective Hamiltonian in the optimal superadiabatic frame. We then consider single-passage Landau--Zener--St\"{u}ckelberg--Majorana interferometry, in which the initial state of the qubit is arbitrary. Violations of the second law of thermodynamics are possible but require exquisite control to achieve deliberately.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of multiple two-level atoms (qubits) in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics system, with a focus on modified superradiance effects between two or four atoms with finite delay times. Using a numerically exact matrix product approach, we explore both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, and highlight the significant influence of time-delayed feedback effects and the clear breakdown of assuming instantaneous coupling dynamics. We first show a system composed of two spatially separated qubits, prepared in a doubly excited state (both fully excited), and provide a comprehensive study of how delayed feedback influences the collective system decay rates, as well as the quantum correlations between waveguide photons, atoms, and between atom and photons. The system is then extended to include two additional qubits located next to the initial ones (four qubits in total), and we demonstrate, by manipulating the initial excitations and the time-delay effects, how long-term quantum correlations and light-matter entangled states can be established.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computer Fingerprinting using Error Syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing matures and moves toward broader accessibility through cloud-based platforms, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of quantum computations becomes an urgent concern. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage the byproducts of quantum error correction (QEC) to verify hardware identity and authenticate quantum computations for ``free'', without introducing any additional quantum computations or measurements. By treating syndrome measurements as a source of metadata, we embed verification seamlessly into standard QEC protocols and eliminate the need for separate challenge-response pairs. We validate our approach using multiple error-correcting codes, quantum states, and circuit compilation strategies on several generations of IBM quantum computers. Our classifiers achieve 99\% accuracy with only 500 shots in distinguishing among five backends. Overall, we re-purpose the intrinsic overhead of error correction to be a mechanism for securing quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of the bucket-brigade quantum random access memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) enables efficient classical data access for quantum computers -- a prerequisite for many quantum algorithms to achieve quantum speedup. Despite various proposals, the experimental realization of QRAM remains largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally investigate the circuit-based bucket-brigade QRAM with a superconducting quantum processor. To facilitate the experimental implementation, we introduce a hardware-efficient gate decomposition scheme for quantum routers, which effectively reduces the depth of the QRAM circuit by more than 30% compared to the conventional controlled-SWAP-based implementation. We further propose an error mitigation method to boost the QRAM query fidelity. With these techniques, we are able to experimentally implement the QRAM architectures with two and three layers, achieving query fidelities up to 0.800 $\pm$ 0.026 and 0.604$\pm$0.005, respectively. Additionally, we study the error propagation mechanism and the scalability of our QRAM implementation, providing experimental evidence for the noise resilience nature of the bucket-brigade QRAM architecture. Our results highlight the potential of superconducting quantum processors for realizing a scalable QRAM architecture.</description>

      <title>Routing thermal noise flow and ground-state cooling in an optomechanical plaquette</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an effective method for cooling two non-degenerate mechanical resonators by routing thermal noise flow in a four-mode optomechanical plaquette. The thermal noise flow between the mechanical resonators can be fully suppressed by addressing the overall loop phase in the plaquette, irrespective of their thermal temperatures. We find that optimal mechanical cooling, even down to the ground state, can be realized in this regime. The thermal noise routing, achieved by dissipation engineering at optomechanical interfaces, provides a valuable and complementary approach to conventional coherent dark-mode control theory. It can be generalized to nonreciprocal control of phonon transport and mechanical cooling, and may find applications in optomechanical networks with complex thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum prime factorization algorithms using binary carry propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RSA cryptosystem, which relies on the computational difficulty of prime factorization, faces growing challenges with the advancement of quantum computing. In this study, we propose a quantum annealing based approach to integer factorization using both high order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) and constrained quadratic model (CQM) formulations. We begin by modeling binary multiplication with explicit carry propagation, translating this into a HUBO representation and subsequently reducing it to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization form compatible with current quantum solvers. To address scalability limitations, we implement a CQM approach with constraint relaxation and global product consistency. While the HUBO model successfully factors small semiprimes, it exhibits exponential memory growth, making it impractical for inputs larger than 10 bits. In contrast, the CQM model achieves accurate factorization of semiprimes up to 60 bits including N = 1152921423002469787 demonstrating significantly improved scalability. Experimental results further show that applying global product constraints enhances factorization accuracy and consistency across all tested instances. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of quantum-assisted factorization and establishes a foundation for evaluating RSA security in the emerging quantum era.</description>

      <title>Quantum versus Classical Separation in Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum versus classical separation plays a central role in understanding the advantages of quantum computation. In this paper, we present the first exponential separation between quantum and bounded-error randomized communication complexity in a variant of the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) model. Namely, the three-player Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead model. Specifically, we introduce the Gadgeted Hidden Matching Problem and show that it can be solved using only $O(\log n)$ simultaneous quantum communication. In contrast, any simultaneous randomized protocol requires $\Omega(n^{1/16})$ communication.
  On the technical side, a key obstacle in separating quantum and classical communication in NOF models is that all known randomized NOF lower bound tools, such as the discrepancy method, typically apply to both randomized and quantum protocols. In this regard, our technique provides a new method for proving randomized lower bounds in the NOF setting and may be of independent interest beyond the separation result.</description>

      <title>Wide band magnetometry based on color centers with transverse zero-field splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state color centers embedded in diamond, silicon carbide (SiC) and other host-matrices offer a promising platform for nanoscale quantum sensing. Sometimes a relatively strong transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) is introduced in a color center due to its local strain and low symmetry of the host structure. While clock transitions induced by transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) serve as a method to prolong the coherence time, the Zeeman sub-levels of solid-state color centers become insensitive to first-order magnetic field signals, thereby limiting their utility as magnetometers. In this work, we address this challenge and achieve wide band AC field detection spanning from hundreds of kHz to hundreds of MHz by utilizing a combination of orthogonal microwaves and phase modulation at different frequencies. Our control method effectively suppresses the system noise and the amplitude fluctuation of the driving field, which extends the coherence time of the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Induced Fault Detection in Superconducting Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for universal superconducting quantum computing is hindered by noise and errors. It has been proven that Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes will lay at the foundation of fault tolerant quantum computing. However, cosmic-ray induced correlated errors, which are the most detrimental events that can impact superconducting quantum computers, are yet to be efficiently tackled. In order to reach fault tolerance, we must also develop radiation aware methods to complement QEC.
  In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to effectively exploit syndrome information for the efficient detection of radiation events in superconducting quantum devices at runtime. We perform a thorough analysis of simulated Rotated Surface codes injecting over 11 million physics-modeled radiation-induced faults. We consider the properties of the X and Z check bases, the impact of code distance, and the decoder's time to solution constraints. Our technique detects $100\%$ of injected faults, regardless of the impact's position. Moreover, we accurately identify both the radiation impact centre and the area affected, with an overhead lower than $0.3\%$ the decoding time. Additionally, we use the fault identification information to propose a radiation fault correction technique that improves of up to $20\%$ the output correctness compared to existing decoders.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a generalization of Weyl's relations in finite dimension $N$, we show that the Heisenberg commutation relations can be satisfied in a specific $N-1$ dimensional subspace, and display a linear map for projecting operators to this subspace. This setup is used to construct a hierarchy of parameter-dependent commuting matrices in $N$ dimensions. This family of commuting matrices is then related to Type-1 matrices representing quantum integrable models. The commuting matrices find an interesting application in quantum computation, specifically in Grover's database search problem. Each member of the hierarchy serves as a candidate Hamiltonian for quantum adiabatic evolution and, in some cases, achieves higher fidelity than standard choices -- thus offering improved performance.</description>

      <title>Experimental Extraction of Coherent Ergotropy and Its Energetic Cost in a Superconducting Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of a system's density matrix, is a key resource in quantum thermodynamics, fundamentally limiting the maximum extractable work, or ergotropy. While previous experiments have isolated coherence-related contributions to work extraction, it remains unclear how coherence can be harnessed in a controllable and energy-efficient manner. Here, we experimentally investigate the role of initial-state coherence in work extraction from a superconducting transmon qubit. By preparing a range of pure states and implementing three complementary extraction protocols, we reveal how coherence governs the partitioning of ergotropy. We find that the choice of initial state depends on the dominant decoherence channel-energy relaxation or dephasing. By further accounting for thermodynamic costs, we identify optimal initial states that maximize the efficiency. These results establish initial-state design as a practical and scalable approach to coherence control, offering guidance for the development of efficient quantum thermodynamic devices.</description>

Abstract: As quantum processing units grow in size and precision we enter the stage where quantum algorithms can be tested on actual quantum devices. To implement a given quantum circuit on a given quantum device, one has to express the circuit in terms of the gates that can be efficiently realized on the device. We propose an algorithm based on algebraic circuit decomposition for tailored application of optimal-control gates for quantum computing platforms with star-shaped topologies. We then show numerically how the resulting circuits can be implemented on a quantum processing unit consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and surrounding nuclear spins.</description>

      <title>Public-Key Quantum Authentication and Digital Signature Schemes Based on the QMA-Complete Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum authentication and digital signature protocol whose security is founded on the Quantum Merlin Arthur~(QMA)-completeness of the consistency of local density matrices. The protocol functions as a true public-key cryptography system, where the public key is a set of local density matrices generated from the private key, a global quantum state. This construction uniquely eliminates the need for trusted third parties, pre-shared secrets, or authenticated classical channels for public key distribution, making a significant departure from symmetric protocols like quantum key distribution. We provide a rigorous security analysis, proving the scheme's unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks by quantum adversaries. The proof proceeds by a formal reduction, demonstrating that a successful forgery would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the QMA-complete Consistency of Quantum Marginal Problem~(QMP). We further analyze the efficiency of verification using partial quantum state tomography, establishing the protocol's theoretical robustness and outlining a path towards practical implementation</description>

      <title>Collective emission of atomic nanorings around an optical nanofiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collective emission of one and two circular arrays of two-level atoms surrounding an optical nanofiber. We show that the radiation eigenmodes of a single ring selectively couple to specific guided modes of the fiber, according to their symmetry, and study how the physical parameters of the system control their nature. In particular, we identify situations in which the emission toward radiation modes is highly suppressed with respect to fiber-guided modes while the lifetime of the atomic excitation is enhanced. We further address the case of two identical nanorings positioned at a distance from each other along the nanofiber. By contrast to free-space configurations, the rings can exchange excitations even at large separation through nanofiber guided modes resulting in enhanced sub- and super-radiance with respect to the single-ring case. Our findings suggest that the ring configuration is promising for the implementation of efficient and versatile light-matter nanofiber-based interfaces and the achievement of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of quantum low-density parity-check codes locally equivalent to higher-dimensional quantum hypergraph-product (QHP) codes. Similarly to QHP codes, the proposed codes have highly redundant sets of low-weight stabilizer generators, which improves decoding accuracy in a fault-tolerant regime and gives them single-shot properties. The advantage of the new construction is that it gives shorter codes. We derive simple expressions for the dimension of the proposed codes in two important special cases, give bounds on the distances, and explicitly construct some relatively short codes. Circuit simulations for codes locally equivalent to 4-dimensional toric codes show a (pseudo)threshold close to 1.1%, better than for toric or surface codes with a similar noise model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the successful experimental generation and verification of genuine multipartite entanglement, several existing entanglement measures remain insufficient to reliably capture its presence. In this study, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a geometric measure known as concurrence fill, which quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement using the area associated with the underlying concurrence triangle. Firstly, the concurrence fill for three-qubit pure states is reformulated using three tangle and partial tangles. This yields a representation that is more tractable and operational. Using this formulation, we derive a criterion to classify GHZ and W class of states. Next, we analyse the rank-2 mixture of generalized GHZ and W class of states. Furthermore, we derive the concurrence fill for the eigenstates of the corresponding mixture and obtain an upper bound for mixed states with zero tangle.</description>

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming the quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8427 \pm 0.0038$, which is 24 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</description>

      <title>Space-time tradeoff for sparse quantum state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the trade-off between the circuit depth and the number of ancillary qubits for preparing sparse quantum states. We prove that any $n$-qubit $d$-spare quantum state (i.e., it has only $d$ non-zero amplitudes) can be prepared by a quantum circuit with depth $O\left(\frac{nd \log m}{m \log m/n} + \log nd\right)$ using $m\geq 6n$ ancillary qubits, which achieves the current best trade-off between depth and ancilla number. In particular, when $m = \Theta({\frac{nd}{\log d}})$, our result recovers the optimal circuit depth $\Theta(\log nd)$ given in \hyperlink{cite.zhang2022quantum}{[Phys. Rev. Lett., 129, 230504(2022)]}, but using significantly fewer gates and ancillary qubits.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Towards the Heisenberg Limit with Locally Interacting Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a robust approach to spin squeezing with local interactions that approaches the Heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity. To generate the requisite entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Relations in an Array of Neutral Atom Qubits -- Experimental Validation of Control Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is a hindering factor for current-era quantum computers. In this study, we experimentally validate the theoretical relationships between control noise and qubit state fidelity. The experiment comprises a 10$\times$10 site optical tweezer array stochastically loaded with single rubidium-85 atoms. A global microwave field is used to manipulate the state of the hyperfine qubits. With precise control of the time-dependent amplitude of the microwave drive, we apply control signals featuring artificial noise. We systematically analyze the impact of various noise profiles on the fidelity distribution of the quantum states. The measured fidelities are compared against theoretical predictions made using the stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Our results show a good agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted results. This validation is consequential, as the model provides critical information on noise identification and optimal control protocols in NISQ-era quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Protocol for detecting the nonlocality of the multi-Majorana Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are non-Abelian quasiparticles with the potential to serve as topological qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In multi-Majorana systems configured into two separated subsystems, nontrivial quantum correlations persist, but the presence of trivial Andreev bound states (ABSs) can obscure this nonlocality if MZM preparation fails. To address this, we propose a protocol using an entanglement witness based solely on parity measurements to distinguish the nonlocal characteristics of MZM systems. Our framework, which is experimentally implementable, achieves a detection probability of approximately 18% in a 6-site system and demonstrates robustness under environmental noise, albeit with a reduced detection rate in the resence of quasiparticle contamination.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic TCL4 Generator for the Spin-Boson Model: Analytical Derivation and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-boson model is a widely used model for understanding the properties of a two-level open quantum system. Accurately describing its dynamics often requires going beyond the weak system-environment coupling approximation. However, calculating the higher-order generators of such a dynamics, with a system-environment coupling that is not too weak, has been known to be challenging, both numerically and analytically. This work presents the analytical derivation of the complete fourth-order time-convolutionless (TCL) generator for a generic spin-boson model, accurate up to 4th order in the system-environment coupling parameter, under the assumption that the environmental spectral density is an odd function of frequency. In the case of a semiconductor double-quantum-dot system, our results reveal corrections to the dynamics that may become physically significant in some parameter regimes. Furthermore, we report that the widely used second-order TCL master equation tends to overestimate the non-Markovianity of a dynamics over a large parameter regime. Within the regime of its applicability, our results provide a computational advantage over numerically exact techniques. The accuracy of the fourth-order TCL generator is rigorously benchmarked against specialized analytical calculations done for the Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff and against the numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion technique.</description>

      <title>Accumulation of Device-Independent Quantum Randomness against Time-Ordered No-Signalling Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of security of practical device-independent protocols against no-signalling adversaries, the ultimate form of cryptographic security, has remained open. A key ingredient is to identify how the entropy in the raw outputs of a Bell test accumulates over $n$ sequential runs (termed time-ordered no-signalling) against a no-signalling adversary. Previous numerical and analytical investigations for small $n$ ($\leq 5$) had suggested that the min-entropy might not accumulate linearly in contrast to the case of quantum adversaries. Here we point out that despite the findings for small $n$, the min-entropy does in fact accumulate linearly for large $n$. We illustrate the difference in randomness accumulation against quantum and no-signalling adversaries with the paradigmatic example of the Chained Bell test for which we analytically derive the min-entropy. Finally, we illustrate the power of the no-signalling adversary by providing a class of attacks that allow an eavesdropper to perfectly guess the outputs of one player in general bipartite Pseudotelepathy games.</description>

      <title>Quantum-corrected Floquet dynamics in the Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiclassical descriptions of the dynamics of a few-level system coupled to a mode of the electromagnetic field which effectively reduce the contribution of the field to a time-dependent term in the Hamiltonian of the few-level system are widely used. For example, such an approach is typically taken in quantum control applications. However, the underlying quantum character of the field will lead to corrections to the semiclassical dynamics which, given sufficient time, can lead to significant changes. Here we develop an approach for calculating these quantum corrections systematically, building on the time-dependent Floquet dynamics that emerges in the semiclassical limit. Using the Rabi model of a spin--field system as an illustrative example, we obtain approximate analytic expressions for the first-order quantum corrections to the semiclassical dynamics of the spin for a range of initial field states. These expressions describe the initial stages of the full quantum dynamics accurately, though they eventually fail for sufficiently long times. Our work has relevance both for understanding the fundamental properties of emergent semiclassical behavior and as a potential tool for assessing corrections to semiclassical control techniques.</description>

      <title>Generalized Code Distance through Rotated Logical States in Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct rotated logical states by applying rotation operators to stabilizer states, extending the logical basis and modifying stabilizer generators. Rotation operators affect the effective code distance $d_R$, which decays exponentially with rotation angles $(\theta, \phi)$, influencing error correction performance. We quantify the scaling behavior of logical error rates under circuit-level noise, comparing standard depolarizing (SD) and superconducting-inspired (SI) noise models with small and large rotations. Our findings show that the rotated code scales as $0.68d_R (0.65d_R)$ for SD and $0.81d_R (0.77d_R)$ for SI, with small rotation angles leading to a steeper decay of logical error rates. At a physical error rate $p_{phy}$ of $10^{-4}$, logical errors decrease exponentially with $d_R$, particularly under SI noise, which exhibits stronger suppression. The threshold error rates for rotated logical states are compared with previous results, demonstrating improved resilience against noise. By extending the logical state basis, rotation-based encoding increases error suppression beyond traditional stabilizer codes, offering a promising approach to advancing quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Learning Quantum Dynamics via Fourier coefficient extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in quantum machine learning is finding relevant machine learning tasks with a provable quantum advantage. A natural candidate for this is learning unknown Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we tackle the supervised learning version of this problem, where we are given random examples of the inputs to the dynamics as classical data, paired with the expectation values of some observable after the time evolution, as corresponding output labels. The task is to replicate the corresponding input-output function. We prove that this task can yield provable exponential classical-quantum learning advantages under common complexity assumptions in natural settings. To design our quantum learning algorithms, we introduce a new method, which we term \textit{\subroutine}~algorithm for parametrized circuit functions, and which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of generalizing our method to arbitrary quantum dynamics while maintaining provable guarantees. We explain that significant generalizations are impossible under certain complexity-theoretic assumptions, but nonetheless, we provide a heuristic kernel method, where we trade-off provable correctness for broader applicability.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Characterization of Bargmann Invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bargmann invariants, also known as multivariate traces of quantum states $\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_1 \rho_2 \cdots \rho_n)$, are unitary invariant quantities used to characterize weak values, Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities, out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), and geometric phases. Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</description>

      <title>No Scratch Quantum Computing by Reducing Qubit Overhead for Efficient Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch qubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate resources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output registers due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces a novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single rotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N $ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \log_2 O $. Leveraging QHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that compress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11, (1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder circuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al., PRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\times $4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic evaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass classical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid superposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains feasible in principle. We see the best application for QHC in finding the minimal qubit and gate resources needed to evaluate any truth table, advancing FPGA capabilities using integrated quantum circuits or photonics.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerance by Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations.
  To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification.
  To utilize fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.</description>

      <title>Comparison of spin-qubit architectures for quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of two quantum error-correcting codes, the surface code and the Bacon-Shor code, for implementation with spin qubits in silicon. In each case, we construct a logical qubit using a planar array of quantum dots, exploring two encoding schemes: one based solely on single-electron Zeeman qubits (Loss-DiVincenzo qubits), and a hybrid approach combining Zeeman and singlet-triplet qubits. For both codes, we evaluate key performance metrics, including logical state preparation fidelity and cycle-level error correction performance, using state-of-the-art experimental parameters. Our results show that the hybrid encoding consistently outperforms the pure Zeeman-qubit implementation. By identifying the dominant error mechanisms that limit quantum error correction performance, our study highlights concrete targets for improving spin qubit hardware and provides a path toward scalable fault-tolerant architectures. In particular, we find that the logical error rate is not limited by memory errors, but rather by gate errors, especially 1- and 2-qubit gate errors.</description>

      <title>Tighter Error Bounds for the qDRIFT Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms such as qDRIFT provide an efficient framework for quantum simulation by sampling terms from a decomposition of the system's generator. However, existing error bounds for qDRIFT scale quadratically with the norm of the generator, limiting their efficiency for large-scale closed or open quantum system simulation. In this work, we refine the qDRIFT error bound by incorporating Jensen's inequality and a careful treatment of the integral form of the error. This yields an improved scaling that significantly reduces the number of steps required to reach a fixed simulation accuracy. Our result applies to both closed and open quantum systems, and we explicitly recover the improved bound in the Hamiltonian case. To demonstrate the practical impact of this refinement, we apply it to three settings: quantum chemistry simulations, dissipative transverse field Ising models, and Hamiltonian encoding of classical data for quantum machine learning. In each case, our bound leads to a substantial reduction in gate counts, highlighting its broad utility in enhancing randomized simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>High-precision Quantum Phase Estimation on a Trapped-ion Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent quantum computing technologies are widely expected to provide novel approaches in the simulation of quantum chemistry. Despite rapid improvements in the scale and fidelity of quantum computers, high resource requirements make the execution of quantum chemistry experiments challenging. Typical experiments are limited in the number of qubits used, incur a substantial shot cost, or require complex architecture-specific optimization and error mitigation techniques. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple benchmarking approach involving the use of multi-ancilla quantum phase estimation. Our approach is restricted to very small chemical systems, and does not scale favorably beyond molecular systems that can be described with $2$ qubits; however, this restriction allows us to generate circuits that scale quadratically in gate count with the number of qubits in the readout register. This enables the execution of quantum chemistry circuits that act on many qubits, while producing meaningful results with limited shot counts. We use this technique (with $200$ shots per experiment) to calculate the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen to $50$ bits of precision ($8.9 \times 10^{-16}$ hartree) on a $56$-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, negating Trotter error. Including Trotter error, we obtain between $32$ and $36$ bits of precision ($1.5 * 10^{-10}$ and $6.0 * 10^{-11}$ hartree respectively), vastly exceeding chemical accuracy ($1.6 * 10^{-3}$ hartree) against Full Configuration Interaction. We consider application of the approach to deeper circuits, and discuss potential as a benchmark task for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Positional numeral systems over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12930v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct positional numeral systems that work natively over nonderived polyadic $\left( m,n\right) $-rings whose addition takes $m$ arguments and multiplication takes $n$. In such rings, the length of an admissible additive word and a multiplicative tower are not arbitrary (as in the binary case), but "quantized". Our main contributions are the following. Existence: every commutative $\left( m,n\right) $-ring admits a base-$p$ place-value expansion that respects the word length constraint in terms of numbers of operation compositions $\ell_{mult}=\ell_{add}(m-1)+1$. Lower bound: the minimum number of digits is greater than or equal to the arity of addition $m$. Representability gap: for $m,n\geq3$ only a proper subset of ring elements possess finite expansions, characterized by congruence-class arity shape invariants $I^{(m)}$ and $J^{(n)}$. Mixed-base "polyadic clocks": allowing a different base at each position enlarges the design space quadratically in the digit count. Catalogues: explicit tables for the integer rings $\mathbb{Z}_{4,3}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{6,5}$ illustrate how ordinary integers lift to distinct polyadic variables. These results lay the groundwork for faster arity-aware arithmetic, exotic coding schemes, and hardware that exploits operations beyond the binary pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study modifications of gravitational wave observables, such as the wave amplitude and frequency, which follow from the quantum equivalence principle, and are expressed in terms of the inertial, gravitational and rest masses of the LIGO/Virgo mirrors. We provide bounds on the violations of the quantum equivalence principle by comparing the results with the most resolved gravitational wave events observed by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The formalism is equally applicable to other future ground and space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Two Types of Temporal Symmetry in the Laws of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the implications of assuming time symmetry and applying bridge-type, time-symmetric temporal boundary conditions to deterministic laws of nature with random components. The analysis, drawing on the works of Kolmogorov and Anderson, leads to two forms of governing equations, referred to here as symmetric and antisymmetric. These equations account for the emergence of characteristics associated with conventional thermodynamics, the arrow of time, and a form of antecedent causality. The directional properties of time arise from the mathematical structure of Markov bridges, without requiring any postulates that impose a preferred direction of time.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Statistics in the Kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit, finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that, surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form factor and present results for different boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.</description>

      <title>Slow Light Augmented Fabry-Perot Cavity for Enhanced Sensitivity in Measuring Frequency Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that a slow-light augmented unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (SLAUMZI) can be used to enhance significantly the sensitivity of measuring the frequency shift of a laser, compared to the conventional technique of heterodyning with a reference laser. Here, we show that a similar enhancement can be realized using a slow-light augmented Fabry-Perot Cavity (SLAFPC), due to the fact that an FPC is inherently unbalanced, since different bounces of the field traverse different path lengths before interfering with the other bounces. We show how the degree of enhancement in sensitivity depends on the spectral width of the laser and the finesse of the FPC. We also show how the sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) for the SLAFPC is much larger than the same for the SLAUMZI for comparable conditions and the same group index, under lossless conditions. In general, the effect of the loss caused by the medium that produces the slow-light process is more prominent for the SLAFPC than the SLAUMZI. However, if the attenuation per pass can be kept low enough while producing a high group index, using cold atoms for generating the slow-light effect, for example, then the SEF for the SLAFPC can be much higher than that for the SLAUMZI. For potentially realizable conditions, we show that an SEF of ~1.4*10^5 can be achieved using a SLAFPC.</description>

      <title>Effects of acceleration on interatomic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect establishes a fundamental equivalence between acceleration and thermality by demonstrating that a uniformly accelerated ground-state detector undergoes excitation as if immersed in a thermal bath. In this paper, we investigate how acceleration influences the interaction between two ground-state atoms that are synchronously and uniformly accelerated in vacuum with proper acceleration $a$ and coupled to a fluctuating electromagnetic field. We find that the resulting interaction potential comprises both diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j=k$, which are present in both inertial and acceleration cases, and off-diagonal components $(\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j\neq k$, which arise exclusively due to acceleration and vanish in the inertial case. The dependence of each component on acceleration and interatomic separation $L$ generally differs. For small accelerations, the leading-order diagonal components of the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction potentials remain unchanged from their inertial counterparts, exhibiting the standard scaling behaviors $\sim L^{-6}$ and $\sim L^{-7}$, respectively. In contrast, the off-diagonal components scale as $\sim a^2L^{-4}$ in the vdW subregions and $\sim a^2L^{-5}$ in the CP subregion. However, when the acceleration becomes sufficiently large, both diagonal and off-diagonal components of the vdW and CP interaction potentials are significantly modified, giving rise to entirely new interaction behaviors that deviate from those observed in the inertial case, whether in vacuum or thermal environments, indicating a breakdown of the acceleration-thermality equivalence established by the Unruh effect for single detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Secure Autonomous Vehicle Navigation: An Architectural Proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various states and taking a confident and safe decision to define the next vehicle maneuver. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles : Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security.

      <title>Band engineering aided by topological edge state proximity effects: Inducing anti-chirality in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze infinite graphene nanoribbons subjected to non-uniform magnetic fields that produce topological domain walls in the quantum Hall regime. We show how the proximity between edge states from neighboring domains modifies the band structure due to the state coupling near the domain walls. The proximity-induced band deformations produce phenomena such as bulk-like dispersion that coexist with Landau levels and valley-polarized current paths. It is shown that edge state coupling can be enhanced by continuously varying the magnetic field between two non-trivial topological phases. The mechanism by which neighboring edge states modify the band structure is addressed by tracking their wave-functions over isolated bands and by analyzing the magnetic confinement potential near the domain wall. By calculating the local current density, we show that the coexistence of topological edge states with bulk-like dispersion can lead to the appearance of anti-chirality, in which co-propagating currents appear in the edges while the rest of the nanoribbon is occupied with bulk states. The appearance of anti-chirality is justified by comparing the proposed non-uniform magnetic field profile with an anti-chiral modified Haldane model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the creation of an optical centrifuge for the controlled rotation of levitated nanorotors within an optical tweezer. The optical centrifuge is created by rapidly rotating the linear polarization of the tightly focused optical field used to form an optical trap. We show that nanorotors, formed by anisotropic nanoparticles levitated within the trap, can be accelerated to well-defined rotational rates in excess of 100 MHz over durations of hundreds of microseconds. The initial conditions required for stable acceleration, based on optical trap properties and the anisotropic susceptibility of the nanorotor are established, and confirmed by numerical simulations. We also present initial experiments that have developed tools for the rapid angular acceleration of the polarization vector of the linearly polarized beam that is required to create the centrifuge. We show that over the acceleration durations in the 100 $\upmu$s range, high rotational speeds could be achieved in modest vacuum.</description>

      <title>Validity of generalized Gibbs ensemble in a random matrix model with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is ubiquitous in quantum mechanical systems where it drives various phase transitions and emergent physics. To understand the role of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the thermalization of a local observable in a disordered system, we consider random symmetric centrosymmetric (SC) matrices where the exchange symmetry is conserved. Such a conservation law splits the Hilbert space into decoupled subspaces such that the energy spectrum of a SC matrix is a superposition of two pure spectra. After discussing the known results on the correlations of such mixed spectrum, we consider different initial states and analytically compute the entire time evolution of their survival probability and associated timescales. We show that there exist certain initial states which do not decay over a very long timescales such that a measure zero fraction of random SC matrices exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Later, we show that thermalization is violated for a generic local observable in case of the SC matrices, where the generalized Gibbs ensemble accurately captures the equilibrium expectation values.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Lambda-SX, a typed quantum lambda-calculus that supports multiple measurement bases. By tracking duplicability relative to arbitrary bases within the type system, Lambda-SX enables more flexible control and compositional reasoning about measurements. We formalise its syntax, typing rules, subtyping, and operational semantics, and establish its key meta-theoretical properties. This proof-of-concept shows that support for multiple bases can be coherently integrated into the type discipline of quantum programming languages.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamical signatures of non-Hermitian boundary modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</description>

      <title>Detection of twisted radiowaves with Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the outer electron in an alkali atom in the presence of structured electromagnetic waves is described. The interaction of the alkali Rydberg atom with twisted radiowaves is considered. The two schemes for Rydberg-atom based detector of twisted radiowaves are proposed. According to the theoretical model for these detectors, they can record a source of twisted radiowaves with power down to several nW. The first scheme of the detector employs the nondipole transitions between Rydberg states induced by twisted radio photons. The second scheme involves the array of Rydberg-atom based antennas, every antenna measuring the dipole transitions excited by plane radiowaves comprising the twisted one.</description>

      <title>Compressibility measurement of the thermal MI--BG transition in an optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder. At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.</description>

      <title>Natural Intelligence: the information processing power of life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merely by existing, all physical systems contain information, and physical dynamics transforms and processes that information. This note investigates the information processing power of living systems. Living systems harvest free energy from the sun, from geothermal sources, and from each other. They then use that free energy to drive the complex set of chemical interactions that underlie life. All molecules -- be they simple molecules such as water, or complex molecules such as DNA -- register information via their chemical composition. When these molecules undergo chemical reactions, that information is transformed and processed. These chemical transformations can be thought of as elementary logical operations: such bio-ops include the absorption of a photon in a chromophore during photosynthesis, the formation or breaking of covalent, hydrogen, and van der Waals bonds in the process of metabolism and reproduction, or the release of a neurotransmitter molecule when a synapse fires in the brain. This paper estimates the total number of bio-ops that have been, and are being performed, by life on earth. We find that the current number of bio-ops performed by all life on earth is around $10^{33}-10^{35}$ bio-ops per second. The cells in an individual human being perform around $10^{20}-10^{22}$ bio-ops per second, comparable to the information processing power of all the computers, cell phones, and server farms on earth. Depending on how one defines a neural operation, at most a few percent of human bio-ops take place in the firing of neurons and synapses in the brain. Over the course of life on earth, about $10^{50}-10^{52}$ bio-ops have taken place.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Telescope Event Classification on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers represent a new computational paradigm with steadily improving hardware capabilities. In this article, we present the first study exploring how current quantum computers can be used to classify different neutrino event types observed in neutrino telescopes. We investigate two quantum machine learning approaches, Neural Projected Quantum Kernels (NPQKs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), and find that both achieve classification performance comparable to classical machine learning methods across a wide energy range. By introducing a moment-of-inertia-based encoding scheme and a novel preprocessing approach, we enable efficient and scalable learning with large neutrino astronomy datasets. Tested on both simulators and the IBM Strasbourg quantum processor, the NPQK achieves a testing accuracy near 80 percent, with robust results above 1 TeV and close agreement between simulation and hardware performance. A simulated QCNN achieves approximately a 70 percent accuracy over the same energy range. These results underscore the promise of quantum machine learning for neutrino astronomy, paving the way for future advances as quantum hardware matures.</description>

      <title>Obtaining continuum physics from dynamical simulations of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking the continuum limit is essential for extracting physical observables from quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories. Achieving the correct continuum limit requires careful control of all systematic uncertainties, including those arising from approximate implementations of the time evolution operator. In this work, we review existing approaches based on renormalization techniques, and point out their limitations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new general framework -- the Statistically-Bounded Time Evolution (SBTE) protocol -- for rigorously controlling the impact of approximate time evolution on the continuum limit. The central insight is that, since exact time evolution introduces no UV divergences, errors from approximate evolution can be treated as a source of systematic uncertainty that can be neglected if reduced below the working statistical uncertainty. We show that, using the SBTE protocol, which prescribes driving the approximate time evolution error below the working statistical uncertainty, leads to a simplified renormalization procedure. Furthermore, we show that, due to the existence of rigorous error bounds, one can guarantee a priori that such errors are negligible and do not affect the continuum limit. Ultimately, our protocol lays the foundation for performing systematic and fair comparisons between different simulation algorithms for lattice gauge theory simulations.</description>

Abstract: The deuteron is the simplest atomic nucleus made of two particles - a proton and a neutron. In this work, we study how their spins are quantum entangled with each other. We study two cases: when the deuteron is in a fixed projection of total angular momentum, and when it exists in a superposition of all projections. Our findings show that the spins are most entangled when the total projection is zero, and that strong entanglement still exists even when all spin states are superposed.</description>

      <title>A Kaleidoscope of Topological Structures in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates with Weyl-Like Spin-Orbit Coupling in Anharmonic Trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) possesses characteristics different from the conventional isotropic s-wave interaction in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the interplay of DDI with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce novel quantum properties. We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI, Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions. Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnets have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum computing, particularly using topologically-protected nanoscale spin textures. While the quantum dynamics of such spin textures has been theoretically studied, direct experimental evidence of their non-classical behavior remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose to employ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) as a method to probe the quantum nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnets. We show that, for a specific geometry, classical skyrmions produce symmetric sidebands in the BLS spectrum, whereas quantum skyrmions exhibit a distinct asymmetry arising from vacuum fluctuations of their rotation. By studying the photon-skyrmion interaction, we calculate the BLS spectrum using a quantum master equation and show that sideband asymmetry serves as a robust witness of energy level quantization. We find that this asymmetry is pronounced at low temperatures, and can be controlled by input laser power. These findings establish a concrete protocol for the optical detection of non-classical features in spin textures, paving the way for exploring their role in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled cluster method tailored by quantum selected configuration interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the quantum-selected configuration interaction-tailored coupled-cluster (QSCI-TCC) method, a hybrid quantum-classical scheme that tailors coupled-cluster (CC) theory with a quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) wave function. QSCI provides a scalable, shot-efficient approach to reconstructing the many-electron state prepared on quantum hardware on a classical computer. The resulting active-space CI coefficients, which are free from additive shot noise, are mapped to fixed cluster amplitudes within the tailored coupled-cluster framework, after which a conventional CC calculation optimizes the remaining amplitudes. This workflow embeds static (strong) correlation from the quantum device and subsequently recovers dynamical (weak) correlation, yielding a balanced description of both. The method is classically simulated and applied to the simultaneous O-H bond dissociation in H$_2$O and the triple-bond dissociation in N$_2$. QSCI-TCC and its perturbative-triples variant, QSCI-TCC(T), provide accurate results even where CCSD or CCSD(T) begin to break down. Shot-count tests for the N$_2$ (6e, 6o) active space demonstrate that, with the (c) correction, chemically sufficient precision ($\leq 1$ kcal/mol) is achieved with only $1.0 \times 10^5$ shots in the strongly correlated regime ($r=2.2$ \r{A}) -- an order of magnitude fewer than required by an earlier matchgate-shadows implementation [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 20, 5068 (2024)]. By pairing resource-efficient quantum sampling with the CC theory, QSCI-TCC provides a promising pathway to quantum-chemical calculations of classically intractable systems.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

Abstract: Pulsed optical self-injection markedly affects the emission characteristics of semiconductor lasers. In this work, we analyze its influence on the statistical properties of laser-pulse interference. We experimentally demonstrate that varying the arrival time of reflected optical pulses back into the laser cavity influences the phase-diffusion and induces an effect that, by analogy with external optical injection, we call phase locking. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of this phenomenon is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information science (QIS) is a critical interdisciplinary field that requires a well-educated workforce in the near future. Numerous researchers and educators have been actively investigating how to best educate and prepare such a workforce. An open issue has been the lack of a validated tool to asses QIS understanding without requiring college-level math. In this paper, we present the systematic development and content validation of a new assessment instrument called the Quantum Information Science Concept Introductory Test (QISCIT). With feedback from 11 QIS experts, we have developed and validated a 31-item version of QISCIT that covers concepts like quantum states, quantum measurement, qubits, entanglement, coherence and decoherence, quantum gates and computing, and quantum communication. In addition to openly sharing our new concept inventory, we discuss how introductory QIS instructors can use it in their courses.</description>

      <title>Fully Self-Consistent Semiclassical Gravity</title>

Abstract: A theory of quantum gravity consists of a gravitational framework which, unlike general relativity, takes into account the quantum character of matter. In spite of impressive advances, no fully satisfactory, self-consistent and empirically viable theory with those characteristics has ever been constructed. A successful semiclassical gravity model, in which the classical Einstein tensor couples to the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of quantum matter fields, would, at the very least, constitute a useful stepping stone towards quantum gravity. However, not only no empirically viable semiclassical theory has ever been proposed, but the self-consistency of semiclassical gravity itself has been called into question repeatedly over the years. Here, we put forward a fully self-consistent, empirically viable semiclassical gravity framework, in which the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a quantum field, evolving via a relativistic objective collapse dynamics, couples to a fully classical Einstein tensor. We present the general framework, a concrete example, and briefly explore possible empirical consequences of our model.</description>

      <title>Interplay among entanglement, measurement incompatibility, and nonlocality</title>

Abstract: Nonlocality, manifested by the violation of Bell inequalities, indicates entanglement within a joint quantum system. A natural question is how much entanglement is required for a given nonlocal behavior. Here, we explore this question by quantifying entanglement using a family of generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type Bell inequalities. Given a Bell-inequality violation, we derive analytical lower bounds on the entanglement of formation, a measure related to entanglement dilution. The bounds also lead to an analytical estimation of the negativity of entanglement. In addition, we consider one-way distillable entanglement tied to entanglement distillation and derive tight numerical estimates. With the additional assumptions of qubit-qubit systems, we find that the relationship between entanglement and measurement incompatibility is not simply a trade-off under a fixed nonlocal behavior. Furthermore, we apply our results to two realistic scenarios -- non-maximally entangled and Werner states. We show that one can utilize the nonlocal statistics by optimizing the Bell inequality for better entanglement estimation.</description>

      <title>Zero Curvature Condition for Quantum Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum criticality often lies beyond the scope of the conventional Landau paradigm, and a unifying framework has yet to emerge, due in part to the wide variety of quantum orders. We propose a geometric approach to quantum phase transitions (QPTs) that shifts focus from microscopic order to the competition between non-commuting operators. This competition is encoded in the boundary geometry of their expectation values, defining a quantum observable space (QOS). We show that QPTs occur at zero-curvature points on the QOS boundary, signaling maximal commutativity and suggesting an underlying integrable structure at criticality.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Logical Noise Bias in Magic State Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant architectures aim to reduce the noise of a quantum computation. Despite such architectures being well studied a detailed understanding of how noise is transformed in a fault-tolerant primitive such as magic state injection is currently lacking. We use numerical simulations of logical process tomography on a fault-tolerant gadget that implements a logical $T = Z(\pi/4)$ gate using magic state injection, to understand how noise characteristics at the physical level are transformed into noise characteristics at the logical level. We show how, in this gadget, a significant phase ($Z$) bias can arise in the logical noise, even with unbiased noise at the physical level. While the magic state injection gadget intrinsically induces biased noise, with extant phase bias being further amplified at the logical level, we identify noisy error correction circuits as a key limiting factor in the circuits studied on the magnitude of this logical noise bias. Our approach provides a framework for assessing the detailed noise characteristics, as well as the overall performance, of fault-tolerant logical primitives.</description>

Abstract: Weak coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive in which two mutually distrustful parties generate a shared random bit to agree on a winner via remote communication. While a stand-alone secure weak coin flipping protocol can be constructed from noiseless quantum communication channels, its composability remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that no weak coin flipping protocol can be abstracted as a simple black-box resource with composable security. Despite this, we also establish the overall stand-alone security of quantum weak coin flipping protocols under composition in sequential order.</description>

      <title>Efficient Magic State Distillation by Zero-Level Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic state distillation (MSD) is an essential element for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, which distills a high-fidelity magic state from noisy magic states using ideal (error-corrected) Clifford operations. For ideal Clifford operations, it needs to be performed on the logical qubits and hence incurs a large spatiotemporal overhead, which is one of the major bottlenecks for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs). Here we propose zero-level distillation, which prepares a high-fidelity logical magic state at the physical level, namely zero level, using physical qubits and nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a square lattice. We develop a zero-level distillation circuit and show that distillation can be made even more efficient than the conventional sophisticated approaches with logical level distillations. The key idea involves the Knill et al.-type distillation using the Steane code and its careful mapping to the square-lattice architecture with error detection. The distilled magic state on the Steane-code state is then teleported or converted to surface codes. We numerically find that the error rate of the logical magic state scales as approximately $100 \times p^{2}$ in terms of the physical error rate $p$. For example, with a physical error rate of $p = 10^{-4}$ ($10^{-3}$), the logical error rate is reduced to $p_{L} = 10^{-6}$ ($10^{-4}$), resulting in an improvement of 2 (1) orders of magnitude. This contributes to reducing both space and time overhead for early FTQC as well as full-fledged FTQC combined with conventional multilevel distillation protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08441v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer states, which are also known as the Clifford states, have been commonly utilized in quantum information, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit simulation due to their simple mathematical structure. In this work, we apply stabilizer states to tackle quantum many-body ground state problems and introduce the concept of stabilizer ground states. We establish an equivalence formalism for identifying stabilizer ground states of general Pauli Hamiltonians. Moreover, we develop an exact and linear-scaled algorithm to obtain stabilizer ground states of 1D local Hamiltonians and thus free from discrete optimization. This proposed equivalence formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on different Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate that stabilizer ground states are promising tools for not only qualitative understanding of quantum systems, but also cornerstones of more advanced classical or quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: A self-consistent quadratic theory is presented to account for nonlinear contributions in quantum dynamics. Evolution equations are shown to depend on higher-order gradients of the Hamiltonian, which are incorporated via their equations of motion or through perturbative calculations. The dynamics is proven trace-preserving, with the Hamiltonian acting as a constant of motion for initial Gaussian states. Nonlinear response functions are calculated perturbatively, and sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of their classical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined from distinct perspectives - as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. We devise quantum subroutines for the matrix geometric means, and construct solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation - an important class of nonlinear systems of equations appearing in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms, for both classical and quantum data, called quantum geometric mean metric learning, for weakly supervised learning and anomaly detection. The subroutines are also useful for estimating geometric R\'enyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity, in particular achieving optimal dependence on precision for the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines.</description>

      <title>Sixth-order time-convolutionless master equation and beyond: Late-time resummations, two types of divergences, and the limits of validity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative master equations are essential for modeling open quantum systems but often exhibit late-time divergences when environmental correlations decay algebraically. In this work, we analyze the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, expanded to order 2n and demonstrate that, while van Kampens cumulants suppress early-time secular growth, they ultimately diverge at long times. To overcome this, we introduce a resummation technique based on the Hadamard trick, which incorporates time integrals directly into the bath spectral density via element-wise multiplication. This approach establishes a maximum expansion order, nmax, and defines a precision limit of the asymptotic states. The resummed master equation features renormalized Bohr frequencies that capture decoherence and spectral overlap effects. In the unbiased spin-boson model, this results in secular inflation of the generator at a temperature-independent rate equal to the decoherence rate and a finite validity time. For exponentially decaying correlations, the method recovers a proper Markovian limit below a critical coupling threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that quantum mechanics is incomplete based on the assumption that local actions cannot influence elements of reality at a distant location (local realism). In this work, using a recently defined quantum reality quantifier, we show that Alice's local quantum operations can be correlated with the erasure of the reality of observables in Bob's causally disconnected laboratory. To this end, we implement a modified optical quantum eraser experiment, ensuring that Alice's and Bob's measurements remain causally disconnected. Using an entangled pair of photons and quantum state tomography, we experimentally verify that, even with the total absence of any form of classical communication, the choice of quantum operation applied by Alice on her photon is correlated with the erasure of a spatial element of reality of Bob's photon. Our results reveal that Bob's photon can entangle two extra non-interacting degrees of freedom, thus confirming that Bob's photon path is not an element of physical reality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic scattering of a twisted (Bessel) electron beam by CO$_2$ molecules is studied theoretically at high energies. The molecule's structure is optimized using coupled cluster theory and density functional theory with correlation-consistent and Pople basis sets. Coulomb potentials are used in the static approximation. The differential and total scattering cross-sections are computed in the first Born approximation. All cross-sections are orientation-averaged using a passive rotational averaging technique. The scattering is studied by the impact of the twisted beam with topological charges in the range $m_l$ = 1 and $m_l$ = 20. The cross sections are, in addition, averaged over the target's impact parameters, which accounts for the cross sections of a large distribution of CO$_2$ molecules. Finally, the molecule's total cross-section by plane waves and twisted beams is reported. The proposed methodology can be applied to study any polyatomic molecule, regardless of its structure.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticles in Superconducting Circuits: Energy Relaxation, Charge and Flux Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticle density observed in low-temperature superconducting circuits is several orders of magnitude larger than the value expected at thermal equilibrium. The tunneling of this excess of quasiparticles across Josephson junctions is recognized as one of the main loss and decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Here we present a unified impedance theory that accounts for quasiparticle energy loss in circuit regions both far and near (across) junctions. Our theory leverages the recent experimental demonstration that the excess quasiparticles are in \emph{quasiequilibrium} [T. Connolly et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 217001 (2024)] and uses a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to predict the amount of charge and flux noise generated by them. We compute the resulting energy relaxation time $T_1$ in transmon qubits with and without junction asymmetric gap engineering, and show that quasiparticles residing away from junctions can play a dominant role in the former case. They also may provide an upper limit for resonator quality factors if the density of amorphous two-level systems is reduced. In addition, we show that charge noise from quasiparticles leads to flux noise that is logarithmic-in-frequency, giving rise to a ``nearly white" contribution that is comparable to the flux noise observed in flux qubits. This contrasts with amorphous two-level systems, whose associated flux noise is shown to be superOhmic. \Addition{We discuss how this quasiparticle flux noise can limit $T_2^{*}$ coherence times in flux-tunable qubits. The final conclusion is that asymmetric gap engineering can greatly reduce noise and increase coherence times in superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it has been shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two-photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</description>

      <title>Time Derivatives of Weak Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time derivative of a physical property often gives rise to another meaningful property. Since weak values provide empirical insights that cannot be derived from expectation values, this paper explores what physical properties can be obtained from the time derivative of weak values. It demonstrates that, in general, the time derivative of a gauge-invariant weak value is neither a weak value nor a gauge-invariant quantity. Two conditions are presented to ensure that the left- or right-time derivative of a weak value is also a gauge-invariant weak value. Under these conditions, a local Ehrenfest-like theorem can be derived for weak values giving a natural interpretation for the time derivative of weak values. Notably, a single measured weak value of the system's position provides information about two additional unmeasured weak values: the system's local velocity and acceleration, through the first- and second-order time derivatives of the initial weak value, respectively. These findings also offer guidelines for experimentalists to translate the weak value theory into practical laboratory setups, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies. An example illustrates how the electromagnetic field can be determined at specific positions and times from the first- and second-order time derivatives of a weak value of position.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Eigensolver Algorithms With Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore accelerating Hamiltonian ground state energy calculation on NISQ devices. We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case. We trained two small models on classically mined data from systems with up to 16 qubits, using XGBoost's Python regressor. We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.12% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Conditional Entanglement Amplification via Non-Hermitian Superradiant Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system may yield a different measurement outcome, especially when the system is coupled to an environment that causes dissipation. Although it is in principle possible that some quantum trajectories lead to exotic highly entangled quantum states, the probability of observing these trajectories is usually extremely low. In this work, we show how to maximize the probability of generating highly entangled states, including maximally entangled cat states, in an ensemble of atoms experiencing superradiant decay. To this end, we analyze an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics between the quantum jumps associated with photon emission. A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally enhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be non-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED system.</description>

      <title>Enhanced microscale NMR spectroscopy of low-gyromagnetic ratio nuclei via hydrogen transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical shifts and J-couplings are fundamental parameters in NMR spectroscopy as they provide structural information about molecules. Extracting these quantities from isotopes such as carbon or nitrogen results in reduced sensitivity due to their low gyromagnetic ratios. In this work, we present a method for detecting chemical shifts and J-couplings at the microscale in low-gyromagnetic-ratio nuclei using NV centers. By leveraging hydrogen nuclei, we achieve strong coupling with NVs and fast signal emission that aligns with NV coherence times. In addition, the technique is well-suited for implementations under high magnetic fields. We demonstrate that our protocol achieves a sensitivity enhancement of more than one order of magnitude for scenarios involving $^{13}$C, with even greater improvements for nuclei with lower gyromagnetic ratios.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet a comprehensive and universal theory that precisely describes the underlying physical mechanisms for each individual state remains elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Besides, we demonstrate that the exceptional point is inherently a quantum phenomenon, as it cannot be described by a single classical orbit. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution to degenerate biphoton states generated in arrays of nonlinear waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrays of nonlinear waveguides are a powerful integrated photonics platform for studying and manipulating quantum states of light. Also, they are a valuable resource for various quantum technologies. In this work, we employed a supermode approach to obtain an analytic solution to the evolution of degenerate biphoton states in arrays of nonlinear waveguides. The solution accounts for arrays of an arbitrary number of waveguides and coupling profiles. In addition, it provides an explicit analytic expression without the need of computationally-expensive steps. Actually, it only relies on the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coupling matrix. In general, this needs to be performed numerically, but there are relevant instances in which analytic expressions are available. Thus, in certain cases, the procedure proposed here does not require the use of any numerical method. We analyze the general properties of the solution and show some application examples. Particularly, simple solutions that can be obtained by special symmetric injection profiles, the results for small arrays, and the properties of the propagation when only the center waveguide is pumped in a symmetric odd array. In addition, we present a proof-of-principle example on how to use the analytic solution to tackle inversion problems. That is, obtaining the initial conditions required to achieve a desired quantum state -- which is a valuable technological application. A relevant aspect of the method presented here is its scalability for large arrays due to the lack of resource-intensive steps -- both for the direct and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Estimation of Nonlinear Quantum State Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient estimation of nonlinear functions of quantum states is crucial for various key tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, fidelity estimation, and feature analysis of quantum data. Conventional methods using state tomography and estimating numerous terms of the series expansion are computationally expensive, while alternative approaches based on a purified query oracle impose practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce the quantum state function (QSF) framework by extending the SWAP test via linear combination of unitaries and parameterized quantum circuits. Our framework enables the implementation of arbitrarily normalized degree-$n$ polynomial functions of quantum states with precision $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. We further apply QSF for developing quantum algorithms for fundamental tasks, including entropy, fidelity, and eigenvalue estimations. Specifically, for estimating von Neumann entropy, quantum relative entropy, and quantum state fidelity, where $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ represent the minimal nonzero eigenvalue and normalized factor, respectively, we achieve a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\gamma^2/(\varepsilon^2\kappa))$. Our work establishes a concise and unified paradigm for estimating and realizing nonlinear functions of quantum states, paving the way for the practical processing and analysis of quantum data.</description>

      <title>Robustness of entanglement in a non-Hermitian cavity-optomechanical system even away from exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum physics can be extended into the complex domain by considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that are $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric. These exhibit exceptional points (EPs) where the eigenspectrum changes from purely real to purely imaginary values and have useful properties enabling applications such as accelerated entanglement generation and the delay of the sudden death of entanglement in noisy systems. An interesting question is whether similar beneficial effects can be achieved away from EPs, since this would extend the available parameter space and make experiments more accessible. We investigate this by considering a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric optomechanical system but also consider what happens when two-mode squeezing interactions are included, taking us into the pseudo-Hermitian regime. The addition of squeezing is motivated by an attempt to extend the lifetime of the system's entanglement. While this does not prove to be the case, rich dynamics are nonetheless observed in both the pseudo-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, including the sudden death and revival of entanglement under certain conditions. In both cases, we find that the sudden disappearance of entanglement can be mitigated at EPs, and also show that the revival of entanglement is quite robust to thermal noise in a group of parameters away from the EPs. This investigation extends our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and opens a new perspective for the development of quantum devices in non-Hermitian systems even away from EPs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically good CSS-T codes and a new construction of triorthogonal codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new systematic construction of CSS-T codes from any given CSS code using a map $\phi$. When $\phi$ is the identity map $I$, we retrieve the construction of [1] and use it to prove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a previously open problem in the literature, and of asymptotically good quantum LDPC CSS-T codes. We analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from this construction ($\phi = I$), concluding that they always result in the logical identity. An immediate application of these codes in dealing with coherent noise is discussed. We then develop a new doubling transformation for obtaining triorthogonal codes, which generalizes the doubling construction presented in [2]. Our approach permits using self-orthogonal codes, instead of only doubly-even codes, as building blocks for triorthogonal codes. This broadens the range of codes available for magic state distillation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a rapidly advancing discipline that leverages the features of quantum mechanics to enhance the performance of computational tasks. Quantum reservoir processing, which allows efficient optimization of a single output layer without precise control over the quantum system, stands out as one of the most versatile and practical quantum machine learning techniques. Here we experimentally demonstrate a quantum reservoir processing approach for continuous-variable state reconstruction on a bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics platform. The scheme learns the true dynamical process through a minimum set of measurement outcomes of a known set of initial states. We show that the map learnt this way achieves high reconstruction fidelity for several test states, offering significantly enhanced performance over using a map calculated based on an idealised model of the system. This is due to a key feature of reservoir processing which accurately accounts for physical non-idealities such as decoherence, spurious dynamics, and systematic errors. Our results present a valuable tool for robust bosonic state and process reconstruction, concretely demonstrating the power of quantum reservoir processing in enhancing real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the algebraic method based on the Lie algebra of quadratic combinations of left and right superoperators associated with matrices to study the Lindblad dynamics of multimode bosonic systems coupled a thermal bath and described by the Liouvillian superoperator that takes into account both dynamical (coherent) and environment mediated (incoherent) interactions between the modes. Our algebraic technique is applied to transform the Liouvillian into the diagonalized form by eliminating jump superoperators and solve the spectral problem. The temperature independent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}_{eff}$, is found to govern both the diagonalized Liouvillian and the spectral properties. It is shown that the Liouvillian exceptional points are represented by the points in the parameter space where the matrix, $H$, associated with $\hat{H}_{eff}$ is non-diagonalizable. We use our method to derive the low-temperature approximation for the superpropagator and to study the special case of a two mode system representing the photonic polarization modes. For this system, we describe the geometry of exceptional points in the space of frequency and relaxation vectors parameterizing the intermode couplings and, for a single-photon state, evaluate the time dependence of the speed of evolution as a function of the angles characterizing the couplings and the initial state.</description>

Abstract: A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</description>

Abstract: Unextendibility of quantum states and channels is inextricably linked to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, it has played an important role in understanding and quantifying entanglement, and more recently it has found applications in providing limitations on quantum error correction and entanglement distillation. Here we generalize the framework of unextendibility to quantum measurements and define $k$-extendible measurements for every integer $k\ge 2$. Our definition provides a hierarchy of semidefinite constraints that specify a set of measurements containing every measurement that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication. Furthermore, the set of $k$-extendible measurements converges to the set of measurements that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication as $k\to \infty$. To illustrate the utility of $k$-extendible measurements, we establish a semidefinite programming upper bound on the one-shot classical capacity of a channel, which outperforms the best known efficiently computable bound from [Matthews and Wehner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60, pp. 7317-7329 (2014)] and also leads to efficiently computable upper bounds on the $n$-shot classical capacity of a channel.</description>

      <title>An unholy trinity: TFNP, polynomial systems, and the quantum satisfiability problem</title>

Abstract: The theory of Total Function NP (TFNP) and its subclasses says that, even if one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a problem, finding this proof can be intractable. Despite the success of the theory at showing intractability of problems such as computing Brouwer fixed points and Nash equilibria, subclasses of TFNP remain arguably few and far between. In this work, we define two new subclasses of TFNP borne of the study of complex polynomial systems: Multi-homogeneous Systems (MHS) and Sparse Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (SFTA). The first of these is based on B\'ezout's theorem from algebraic geometry, marking the first TFNP subclass based on an algebraic geometric principle. At the heart of our study is the computational problem known as Quantum SAT (QSAT) with a System of Distinct Representatives (SDR), first studied by [Laumann, L\"auchli, Moessner, Scardicchio, and Sondhi 2010]. Among other results, we show that QSAT with SDR is MHS-complete, thus giving not only the first link between quantum complexity theory and TFNP, but also the first TFNP problem whose classical variant (SAT with SDR) is easy but whose quantum variant is hard. We also show how to embed the roots of a sparse, high-degree, univariate polynomial into QSAT with SDR, obtaining that SFTA is contained in a zero-error version of MHS. We conjecture this construction also works in the low-error setting, which would imply SFTA is contained in MHS.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</description>

Abstract: Accurately characterizing the properties of structured reservoirs is a key challenge in quantum systems and is of great importance for advances in quantum metrology and sensing. In this work, we employ a two-level system (qubit) as a probe, which is coupled to a structured reservoir consisting of an ancilla qubit and a Markovian environment modeled as a thermal bath. By exploiting non-Markovian dynamics, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of different interaction types between the probe and ancilla for estimating critical parameters, including temperature, ancilla frequency, and system-bath coupling strength. We quantify the precision of parameter estimation using quantum Fisher information (QFI) and analyze the system dynamics in both transient and steady-state regimes. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovianity substantially enhances parameter estimation in the transient regime, with specific interactions facilitating sustained information backflow and yielding higher QFI values. However, the performance of these interactions is contingent on the parameter under estimation and the operational regime. For instance, certain interactions become prominent in the transient regime but exhibit diminished utility in the steady state, whereas others maintain their effectiveness even at equilibrium. These results stress the importance of judiciously selecting interactions adapted to specific estimation objectives and operational regimes.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is solely a quantum property and it can be extremely helpful to test the physics beyond the Standard Model in tabletop experiments with the advent of future quantum technologies. In this work, we provide an entanglement-based partial positive transpose witness for Yukawa-type potentials in the infrared regime between pairs of neutral/charged particles in a spatial quantum superposition. The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as axionlike particle or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity. We will study the constrained couplings in a few different models along with the decoherence rate to show what parameters can be searched for in near-future entanglement-driven experiments for the search of new physics.</description>

Abstract: Fast execution of complex quantum circuit simulations are crucial for verification of theoretical algorithms paving the way for their successful execution on the quantum hardware. However, the main stream CPU-based platforms for circuit simulation are well-established but slower. Despite this, adoption of GPU platforms remains limited because different hardware architectures require specialized quantum simulation frameworks, each with distinct implementations and optimization strategies. Therefore, we introduce Q-Gear, a software framework that transforms Qiskit quantum circuits into Cuda-Q kernels. By leveraging Cuda-Q seamless execution on GPUs, Q-Gear accelerates both CPU and GPU based simulations by respectively two orders of magnitude and ten times with minimal coding effort. Furthermore, Q-Gear leverages Cuda-Q configuration to interconnect GPUs memory allowing the execution of much larger circuits, beyond the memory limit set by a single GPU or CPU node. Additionally, we created and deployed a Podman container and a Shifter image at Perlmutter (NERSC/LBNL), both derived from NVIDIA public image. These public NERSC containers were optimized for the Slurm job scheduler allowing for close to 100% GPU utilization. We present various benchmarks of the Q-Gear to prove the efficiency of our computation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Thirty-six officers, artisanally entangled</title>

Abstract: A perfect tensor of order $d$ is a state of four $d$-level systems that is maximally entangled under any bipartition. These objects have attracted considerable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect tensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS). Deciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult problem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by Leonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of "36 officers". It took more than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet another century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36 entangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and verification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. In this paper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose the Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^6)^{\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct sum $(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 2}\oplus(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 3}$ comprising superpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise when certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors. Technically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions ansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and \.Zyczkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a two-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families. Finally, we sketch a formulation of the theory of perfect tensors in terms of quasi-orthogonal decompositions of matrix algebras.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled optical large-baseline interferometry: applications, protocols and feasibility</title>

Abstract: Optical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offers the potential for unprecedented angular resolution in both astronomical imaging and precision measurements. Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due to photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay lines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in quantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using entanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal measurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we also examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically, the monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to quantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long baseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which offer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we also compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current state-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate times, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating quantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve diffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, surpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision tests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fast correlated decoding of transversal logical algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is required for large-scale computation, but incurs a significant resource overhead. Recent advances have shown that by jointly decoding logical qubits in algorithms composed of transversal gates, the number of syndrome extraction rounds can be reduced by a factor of the code distance $d$, at the cost of increased classical decoding complexity. Here, we reformulate the problem of decoding transversal circuits by directly decoding relevant logical operator products as they propagate through the circuit. This procedure transforms the decoding task into one closely resembling that of a single-qubit memory propagating through time. The resulting approach leads to fast decoding and reduced problem size while maintaining high performance. Focusing on the surface code, we prove that this method enables fault-tolerant decoding with minimum-weight perfect matching, and benchmark its performance on example circuits including magic state distillation. We find that the threshold is comparable to that of a single-qubit memory, and that the total decoding run time can be, in fact, less than that of conventional lattice surgery. Our approach enables fast correlated decoding, providing a pathway to directly extend single-qubit QEC techniques to transversal algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Unitary metaplectic representations of the group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ are necessary to describe the evolution of $2^n$-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. It is shown that in order for the metaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n$-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary. Thus we construct the general matrix form of such representations based on the magnetic translations of the diagonal subgroup $HW_{2^n} \otimes HW_{2^n}$. Comparisson with other approaches on this problem of the literature are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous quantum thermal machines are particularly suited to understand how correlations between thermal baths, a load, and a thermal machine affect the overall thermodynamic functioning of the setup. Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate photon-mediated magnon-magnon coupling between spatially separated Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and permalloy (NiFe) thin films placed on a planar hexagonal ring resonator. We observe clear signatures of magnon-magnon interaction in the absence of direct dipolar interaction between the magnetic films. Notably, the coupling strength between the hexagonal ring resonator and the permalloy film increases with the thickness of the YIG film, despite a fixed permalloy film thickness, suggesting the presence of an indirect interaction channel mediated by resonator photons. To support these findings, we present a theoretical model that accurately reproduces the observed transmission spectra and reveals a nontrivial interdependence between the individual coupling strengths of YIG and permalloy to the resonator. These results underscore the importance of indirect interactions and potential crosstalk pathways in designing hybrid magnonic systems and scalable quantum architectures, while demonstrating the feasibility of cost-effective, planar configurations for experimental implementation. These insights are valuable for advancing low-loss, coherent information transfer in hybrid quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum guessing games offer a structured approach to analyzing quantum information processing, where information is encoded in quantum states and extracted through measurement. An additional aspect of this framework is the influence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement strategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the guessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side information, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the success probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction by introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information about information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side information of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet provided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no expectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have operational consequences for the guessing task. Our results demonstrate that metainformation can, in certain scenarios, enhance the achievable success probability up to the point that post-measurement side information becomes as useful as prior-measurement side information, while in others it offers no benefit. By formally distinguishing metainformation from actual side information, we uncover a finer structure in the interplay between timing, information, and strategy, offering new insights into the capabilities of quantum systems in information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>The logical structure of contextuality and nonclassicality</title>

Abstract: Quantum contextuality is known as the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. It is not clear whether contextuality fully reveals the nonclassical aspects of quantum mechanics. To answer this question, we propose a mathematical framework based on logic algebra to compare classical and quantum experiments. With the framework, we precisely characterize the contextuality and nonclassicality, reveal that the former is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the latter, and present a type of quantum experiments which exhibit nonclassicality without contextuality. We also point out that the property of quantum systems is captured by the projector generators. Therefore, it is possible to witness quantum contextuality with simplified measurement configurations. For example, we show that 12 projectors witness the Kochen-Specker contextuality, and 3 measurements are sufficient to witness the quantum contextuality, as compared to the 4 presented in the compatibility graph approach.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz force with graphene: theory versus experiment, role of spatial non-locality and of losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of spatial non-locality and losses in the electromagnetic response of graphene on the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. To this purpose, we calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the recent experiment in PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021) and PRB {\bf 104}, 085436 (2021). We calculated the CLF using three different models for the electromagnetic response of graphene: electric conductivity using a non-local and lossy Kubo model, electric conductivity using the local and lossy Kubo model, and the non-local and lossless polarization operator model. The relation between these three models has been recently explored in PRB {\bf 111}, 115428 (2025). We show that, for the parameters of the available experiments, the theoretical predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical (having a relative differences smaller than $10^{-3}$). This implies that for those given experiments, both non-local and lossy effects in the graphene response are completely negligible. We also find that this experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions for the involved materials (gold and graphene). Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model for the electric conductivity, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations. We also show how the Polarization tensor must be used and modified in general, for phenomena needing a more fine response function, i.e. requiring both the spatial non-locality and losses.</description>

      <title>A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</description>

Abstract: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) by precisely measuring effects on atomic systems. Previous studies have demonstrated their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM candidates, yet their potential for probing spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM across several frameworks for massive gravity, including the Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios. We show that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce measurable phase shifts in atom interferometers through three coupling mechanisms: scalar interactions that modify atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that alter the propagation of both atoms and light. We demonstrate that these multifaceted interactions enable atom interferometers to probe a range of ULDM properties and mass scales that are inaccessible to laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Our results establish the potential of atom interferometers to open a new experimental frontier for spin-2 dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $&gt; 400$-fold and $&gt; 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</description>

      <title>Critical Limitations in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07231v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality configuration interaction (CI) expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

Abstract: Every state on the algebra $M_n$ of complex nxn matrices restricts to a state on any matrix system. Whereas the restriction to a matrix system is generally not open, we prove that the restriction to every *-subalgebra of $M_n$ is open.

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of real state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs containing generalized clusters, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be either the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix, or the signless Laplacian matrix of an associated weighted graph. This framework provides a unified approach for constructing new graphs that exhibit perfect real state transfer, building on known examples with this property. A central observation is that the evolution of certain quantum states depends solely on the local structure of the underlying graph. In particular, we construct an infinite family of graphs with maximum valency five that exhibit perfect pair state transfer-under each of the aforementioned matrices-between the same pair of states at the same time, despite being non-regular. Additionally, we identify instances of perfect pair state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, blow-up graphs, and related structures. We also examine various graph operations-such as the sequential join, complement, Cartesian product, lexicographic product, and corona product-that generate new families of graphs exhibiting perfect real state transfer with respect to all three choices of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer in Grover walks on association schemes and distance-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates perfect state transfer in Grover walks, a model of discrete-time quantum walks. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of perfect state transfer on graphs belonging to an association scheme. Our focus includes specific association schemes, namely the Hamming and Johnson schemes. We characterize all graphs on the classes of Hamming and Johnson schemes that exhibit perfect state transfer. Furthermore, we study perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs. We provide complete characterizations for exhibiting perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs of diameter $2$ and diameter $3$, as well as integral distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Verification of Quantum Circuits through Barrier Certificates using a Scenario Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various techniques have been explored for the verification of quantum circuits, including the use of barrier certificates, mathematical tools capable of demonstrating the correctness of such systems. These certificates ensure that, starting from initial states and applying the system's dynamics, the system will never reach undesired states. In this paper, we propose a methodology for synthesizing such certificates for quantum circuits using a scenario-based approach, for both finite and infinite time horizons. In addition, our approach can handle uncertainty in the initial states and in the system's dynamics. We present several case studies on quantum circuits, comparing the performance of different types of barrier certificate and analyzing which one is most suitable for each case.</description>

      <title>Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A novel approach to objective collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of Schr\"odinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schr\"odinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.</description>

      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</description>

      <title>Entanglement through high-energy scattering in noncommutative quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</description>
