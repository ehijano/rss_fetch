      <title>Impact of Annealing and Nanostructuring on Properties of NV Centers Created by Different Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds have been an epicenter of research for diverse applications in quantum technologies. It is therefore imperative that their fabrication techniques are well understood and characterized for the technological scalability of these applications. A comparative study of the optical and spin properties of NVs created by ion implantation and chemical vapor deposition delta-doping is thus presented, combined with an investigation on the impact of annealing in vacuum at different temperatures. In addition, nanopillars are fabricated with electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching for enhanced photon collection efficiency. An extensive combination of characterization techniques is employed. Notably, the smallest nanopillars present fluorescence enhancements of factor around 50, compared to the unstructured regions. Annealing is also demonstrated to increase the optical contrast between the NVs' electronic states, the coherence and relaxation times both in bulk as in pillars. Regarding the NV preparation technique, the delta-doping is shown to create NVs with less lattice defects and strain compared to implantation.</description>

      <title>Object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on the difference between fission neutron and heavy ion irradiation induced void evolution in Fe-Cr alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental results show significant difference between neutrons and ions irradiation of alloys, while the underlying reasons remain unclear. Herein, we performed object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) simulations on void evolution in Fe-Cr alloys under neutron and ion irradiations, focusing on the effects of dose rate, irradiation particle type and temperature. Binary Collision Approximation and Molecular Dynamics are applied to obtain the cascade morphology of ion irradiation in order to study the effect of spatial correlation of cascades along the ion track, which is considered as a significant difference between the neutron and ion irradiations. Systematic OKMC simulations were performed at a wide range of dose rate from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-3}$ dpa/s and temperature from 300 to 500 $^\circ C$. Simulation results show that both a higher dose rate and a lower temperature can lead to a higher density and a smaller average size of voids. The impact of irradiation particle types that has influence on the primary knock-on atom spectrum and cascade morphology is less important to void evolution compared with dose rate and irradiation temperature. This work provides fundamental insights into the difference in void evolution between fission neutron and heavy ion irradiations that are important to the application of ion irradiations in study irradiation effects of nuclear materials.</description>

      <title>Electroelastic guided wave dispersion in piezoelectric plates: spectral methods and laser-ultrasound experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroelastic waves in piezoelectric media are widely used in sensing and filtering applications. Despite extensive research, computing the guided wave dispersion remains challenging. This paper presents semi-analytical approaches based on spectral methods to efficiently and reliably compute dispersion curves. We systematically assess the impact of electrical boundary conditions on a 128{\deg} Y-cut LiNbO3 wafer, examining open-open, open-shorted and shorted-shorted surfaces configurations. Multi-modal dispersion maps obtained from laser-ultrasonic experiments for each boundary condition exhibit excellent agreement with the computational predictions. A straightforward implementation of the spectral collocation method is made available as "GEW piezo plate" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14205789), while the spectral element method will be integrated to "GEWtool" (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10114243). Therewith, we aim to make advanced semi-analytical techniques more accessible to physicists and engineers relying on dispersion analysis.</description>

      <title>A fast and accurate semi-analytical method to determine the thermal response of bore fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and the simulation of a borehole-heat-exchanger (BHE) field is usually performed by simplified methods that yield either an overestimation or an underestimation of the thermal response. The methods employing the assumption of a uniform heat rate per unit BHE length overestimate the thermal response, while those employing the assumption of a uniform temperature of the external surface of the BHEs underestimate it. An accurate semi-analytical method to determine the g-function of a bore field with the real condition of BHEs fed in parallel with equal inlet temperature was developed by Cimmino (Int J Heat Mass Tran 91, 2015). An alternative semi-analytical method that yields the same results is presented in this paper. The method is implemented in a C++ program, available at the open-source online data repository of the University of Bologna. Thanks to several optimizations, the program yields a very accurate thermal response of bore fields of any shape with an extremely short computation time. The program is employed to analyze the inaccuracies caused by the assumptions of uniform heat rate and uniform surface temperature of the BHEs. It is also used to illustrate the low performance of the central BHEs in large and compact bore fields, and to show how the bore field can be optimized for a given plot of land and a fixed total length of the field.</description>

      <title>Onset of wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via alternating signs of Willis coupling. A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is considered, and the wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. Further, reversing Willis-coupling signs is proven to yield reciprocal band structures with wavenumber bandgaps, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Dual-Axis Beam-Steering OPA with purely Passive Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a multi-layer optical phased array (OPA) designed for dual-axis beam steering on a silicon (Si) platform, utilizing only wavelength tuning. Our design eliminates the need for grating couplers, commonly required for dual-axis beam steering, thereby reducing energy losses due to substrate leakage. It also features the unique capability of achieving a positive or negative phase slope profile. This three-dimensional architecture enhances output efficiency by emitting light from the device edge, providing greater flexibility and improved performance in beam steering. This approach opens up new possibilities for on-chip photonic systems, enabling faster, more accurate, and broader beam steering range.</description>

      <title>Adhesion study at the interface of PDMS-elastomer and borosilicate glass-slide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adhesion control at the interface of two surfaces is crucial in many applications. Examples are the design of micro and nanodevices such as microfuidics devices, biochips, and electronic sensors. Adhesion at the interface of two materials can be controlled by various methods such as chemical treatment on the surface of the materials, modification of the surface texture of materials, and change of the mechanical properties of materials. The main idea of this study is to control the adhesion by changing the mechanical properties (modulus) of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer. We vary the modulus of PDMS elastomer by changing the mixing ratio of silicone elastomer base mixing ratio and its curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning). Our study also includes the effect of the thickness of the PDMS elastomer sheet on its adhesion behavior. Adhesion measurements at the interface of the borosilicate glass slide and different PDMS elastomer specimens were performed using a wedge test. This method inserts a glass coverslip at the interface to create the wedge. We observe a significant decrease in the work of adhesion and an increase in equilibrium crack length with an increase in elastic-modulus and thickness of the PDMS elastomer samples. We present and discuss the effect of modulus and specimen-thickness on the adhesion behavior of PDMS elastomer against glass slide.</description>

      <title>Continuous Varifocal Metalens Based on Phase-Change Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have provided new opportunities for the realization of flat lenses, among which tunable metalenses have garnered considerable attention due to their flexible functionalities. In this paper, we present a continuously tunable metalens based on the phase-change material Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$, which enables precise and continuous focal length control through the transition of states. Under the excitation of linearly polarized light at 1550 nm, phase compensation is provided by changing the crystallization state of the Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$ nanopillars, allowing the focal length to continuously shift between 36 $\mu$m and 48 $\mu$m. At the same time, the metalens maintains a high focusing efficiency over 75%. This approach provides greater design flexibility and broader applicability across diverse applications. By reducing the reliance on polarized light sources, it enhances device integration and tunability, paving the way for new opportunities in the practical implementation of metalenses in advanced optical imaging and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of in vitro neuronal activity processing using a CMOS-integrated ZrO2-based memristive crossbar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of the epileptiform neuronal activity on the response of a CMOS-integrated ZrO2-based memristive crossbar and its conductivity was studied. Epileptiform neuronal activity was obtained in vitro in the hippocampus slices of laboratory mice using 4-aminopyridine experimental model. Synaptic plasticity of the memristive crossbar induced by epileptiform neuronal activity pulses was detected. Qualitatively, the results obtained in the case of normal (without pathologies) and epileptiform neuronal activity with and without noise coincide. For quantitative analysis, the value of the relative change in synaptic weight has been calculated for such important biological mechanisms of synapses as paired-pulse facilitation/depression, post-tetanic potentiation/depression, and long-term potentiation/depression. It has been shown that average value of the relative change in synaptic weight and its are smaller mainly in the case of epileptiform neuronal activity pulses. An effect of the influence of noise included in the neuronal activity was found, which consists in the fact that the current response of the memristive crossbar is smaller in the presence of noise. The results of this study can be used in the development of new generation hardware-implemented computing devices with high performance and energy efficiency for the tasks of restorative medicine and robotics. In particular, using these results, neurohybrid devices can be developed for processing epileptiform activity in real time and for its suppression.</description>

      <title>Low-power 7-bit hybrid volatile/ nonvolatile tuning of ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits are expected to play an increasingly important role to enable high-bandwidth optical interconnects, and large-scale in-memory computing as needed to support the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. To that end, chalcogenide-based non-volatile phase-change materials (PCMs) present a promising solution due to zero static power. However, high switching voltage and small number of operating levels present serious roadblocks to widespread adoption of PCM-programmble units. Here, we demonstrate electrically programmable wide bandgap Sb2S3-clad silicon ring resonator using silicon microheater at CMOS compatible voltage of &lt; 3V. Our device shows low switching energy of 35.33 nJ (0.48 mJ) for amorphization (crystallization) and reversible phase transitions with high endurance (&gt; 2000 switching events) near 1550 nm. Combining volatile thermo-optic effect with non-volatile PCMs, we demonstrate 7-bit (127 levels) operation with excellent repeatability and reduced power consumption. Our demonstration of low-voltage and low-energy operation, combined with the hybrid volatilenonvolatile approach, marks a significant step towards integrating PCM-based programmable units in large-scale optical interconnects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and implementation of a versatile ad-hoc metropolitan-range Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) network. The approach presented integrates various types of physical channels and QKD protocols, and a mix of trusted and untrusted nodes. Unlike conventional QKD networks that predominantly depend on either fiber-based or free-space optical (FSO) links, the testbed presented amalgamates FSO and fiber-based links, thereby overcoming some inherent limitations. Various network deployment strategies have been considered, including permanent infrastructure and provisional ad-hoc links to eradicate coverage gaps. Furthermore, the ability to rapidly establish a network using portable FSO terminals and to investigate diverse link topologies is demonstrated. The study also showcases the successful establishment of a quantum-secured link to a cloud server.</description>

      <title>Optical studies of melanin films as a material for solar light absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates optical and electrical properties of thin melanin films self-organized grown from water solutions of eumelanin extracted from edible plants. The melanin films exhibit the characteristics of a transparent low conductive polymer with stable in time electrical parameters. The films demonstrate indirect allowed optical transitions, an optical band gap E_g = 1.7 eV and a phonon energy {\hbar \omega} = 0.185 eV as well as a high absorption coefficient in the ultraviolet range, which highlight the film potential for applications as light-absorbing layers in photovoltaic solar energy converters. Analysis of infrared transmission spectra evidences presence of a significant amount of OH groups in the films, pointing to their hydrophilicity, which may have an effect on the film electrical conductivity. It is hypothesized as well that the ratio of sp^3 to sp^2 hybridized CH_n bonds influences the films' optical and electrical properties and that higher concentration of the sp^2 bonds may increase the conductivity due to the enhanced {\pi}-electron delocalization.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Tunable Self-Assembled Nanocrystal Supercrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing tunable functional materials with built-in nanoscale heat flow directionality represents a significant challenge that could advance thermal management strategies. Here we use spatiotemporally-resolved thermoreflectance to visualize lateral thermal transport anisotropy in self-assembled supercrystals of anisotropic Au nanocrystals. Correlative electron and thermoreflectance microscopy reveal that nano- to meso-scale heat predominantly flows along the long-axis of the anisotropic nanocrystals, and does so across grain boundaries and curved assemblies while voids disrupt heat flow. We finely control the anisotropy via the aspect ratio of constituent nanorods, and it exceeds the aspect ratio for nano-bipyramid supercrystals and certain nanorod arrangements. Finite element simulations and effective medium modeling rationalize the emergent anisotropic behavior in terms of a simple series resistance model, further providing a framework for estimating thermal anisotropy as a function of material and structural parameters. Self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals promises an interesting route to direct heat flow in a wide range of applications that utilize this important class of materials.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anistropic spheres and ellipsoids and present the results for spheres. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.</description>

Abstract: Negative index metamaterials (NIMs) can be achieved with uniaxial hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) featuring $\epsilon_{parallel}&gt;0$ and $\epsilon_{perpendicular}&lt;0$. This type of approach has been traditionally realized using stacked doped/undoped semiconductor layers. Only recently surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising low-loss alternative to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Despite this advantage, the SPhP-based approach has been underexplored due to the challenges associated with ensuring high crystal quality in the heterostructure when using alloys with different phonon frequencies. In this work, we design a phononic-driven NIM using a ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O heterostructure, demonstrating control over its hyperbolic behavior through the precise selection of the Mg content and the relative layer thicknesses. Our study shows that increasing the Mg content in the ternary layers enhances the type I behavior, and that the optimal layer thickness varies depending on the Mg content. After analyzing the conditions for achieving type I hyperbolic dispersion, we experimentally demonstrate this concept with a sample featuring equal layer thicknesses and a 32% Mg concentration. We characterize the structure by means of polarized reflectance spectroscopy and use attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy to report the presence of a SPhP mode located within the type I hyperbolic region. By employing the transfer matrix method, we demonstrate that this mode exhibits negative frequency dispersion, a hallmark of type I hyperbolic modes, and isofrequency curve calculations further confirm this behavior. Controlling the design of a phononic hyperbolic type I metamaterial lays the groundwork for exploring its potential applications in attaining low-loss, sub-diffraction-limited optical modes using SPhP excitations.</description>
