      <title>Predictive uncertainty estimation in deep learning for lung carcinoma classification in digital pathology under real dataset shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown tremendous progress in a wide range of digital pathology and medical image classification tasks. Its integration into safe clinical decision-making support requires robust and reliable models. However, real-world data comes with diversities that often lie outside the intended source distribution. Moreover, when test samples are dramatically different, clinical decision-making is greatly affected. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in models is crucial for well-calibrated predictions and determining when (or not) to trust a model. Unfortunately, many works have overlooked the importance of predictive uncertainty estimation. This paper evaluates whether predictive uncertainty estimation adds robustness to deep learning-based diagnostic decision-making systems. We investigate the effect of various carcinoma distribution shift scenarios on predictive performance and calibration. We first systematically investigate three popular methods for improving predictive uncertainty: Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble, and few-shot learning on lung adenocarcinoma classification as a primary disease in whole slide images. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness of the methods in terms of performance and calibration under clinically relevant distribution shifts such as in-distribution shifts comprising primary disease sub-types and other characterization analysis data; out-of-distribution shifts comprising well-differentiated cases, different organ origin, and imaging modality shifts. While studies on uncertainty estimation exist, to our best knowledge, no rigorous large-scale benchmark compares predictive uncertainty estimation including these dataset shifts for lung carcinoma classification.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data-Sketches and Fine-Tuning for Early Detection of Distributional Drift in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in the underlying data distribution that could affect diagnostic or treatment decisions. However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift; for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a vision transformer pre-trained model to extract relevant features using breast cancer images as an example, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11\%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50\% increased to 100\%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1\% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</description>

      <title>DFT-Based Adversarial Attack Detection in MRI Brain Imaging: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy in Alzheimer's Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly in medical imaging, have significantly propelled the progress of healthcare systems. However, examining the robustness of medical images against adversarial attacks is crucial due to their real-world applications and profound impact on individuals' health. These attacks can result in misclassifications in disease diagnosis, potentially leading to severe consequences. Numerous studies have explored both the implementation of adversarial attacks on medical images and the development of defense mechanisms against these threats, highlighting the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to such adversarial activities. In this study, we investigate adversarial attacks on images associated with Alzheimer's disease and propose a defensive method to counteract these attacks. Specifically, we examine adversarial attacks that employ frequency domain transformations on Alzheimer's disease images, along with other well-known adversarial attacks. Our approach utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder architecture in conjunction with the two-dimensional Fourier transform of images for detection purposes. The simulation results demonstrate that our detection and defense mechanism effectively mitigates several adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks against such vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Reference-free Axial Super-resolution of 3D Microscopy Images using Implicit Neural Representation with a 2D Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis and visualization of 3D microscopy images pose challenges due to anisotropic axial resolution, demanding volumetric super-resolution along the axial direction. While training a learning-based 3D super-resolution model seems to be a straightforward solution, it requires ground truth isotropic volumes and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, existing methods utilize 2D neural networks to reconstruct each axial slice, eventually piecing together the entire volume. However, reconstructing each slice in the pixel domain fails to give consistent reconstruction in all directions leading to misalignment artifacts. In this work, we present a reconstruction framework based on implicit neural representation (INR), which allows 3D coherency even when optimized by independent axial slices in a batch-wise manner. Our method optimizes a continuous volumetric representation from low-resolution axial slices, using a 2D diffusion prior trained on high-resolution lateral slices without requiring isotropic volumes. Through experiments on real and synthetic anisotropic microscopy images, we demonstrate that our method surpasses other state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

      <title>Modeling the Neonatal Brain Development Using Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain undergoes rapid development during the third trimester of pregnancy. In this work, we model the neonatal development of the infant brain in this age range. As a basis, we use MR images of preterm- and term-birth neonates from the developing human connectome project (dHCP). We propose a neural network, specifically an implicit neural representation (INR), to predict 2D- and 3D images of varying time points. In order to model a subject-specific development process, it is necessary to disentangle the age from the subjects' identity in the latent space of the INR. We propose two methods, Subject Specific Latent Vectors (SSL) and Stochastic Global Latent Augmentation (SGLA), enabling this disentanglement. We perform an analysis of the results and compare our proposed model to an age-conditioned denoising diffusion model as a baseline. We also show that our method can be applied in a memory-efficient way, which is especially important for 3D data.</description>

      <title>MicroSSIM: Improved Structural Similarity for Comparing Microscopy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy is routinely used to image biological structures of interest. Due to imaging constraints, acquired images are typically low-SNR and contain noise. Over the last few years, regression-based tasks like unsupervised denoising and splitting have found utility in working with such noisy micrographs. For evaluation, Structural Similarity (SSIM) is one of the most popular measures used in the field. For such tasks, the best evaluation would be when both low-SNR noisy images and corresponding high-SNR clean images are obtained directly from a microscope. However, due to the following three peculiar properties of the microscopy data, we observe that SSIM is not well suited to this data regime: (a) high-SNR micrographs have higher intensity pixels as compared to low SNR micrographs, (b) high-SNR micrographs have higher intensity pixels than found in natural images, images for which SSIM was developed, and (c) a digitally configurable offset is added by the detector present inside the microscope. We show that SSIM components behave unexpectedly when the prediction generated from low-SNR input is compared with the corresponding high-SNR data. We explain this behavior by introducing the phenomenon of saturation, where the value of SSIM components becomes less sensitive to (dis)similarity between the images. We introduce microSSIM, a variant of SSIM, which overcomes the above-discussed issues. We justify the soundness and utility of microSSIM using theoretical and empirical arguments and show the utility of microSSIM on two tasks: unsupervised denoising and joint image splitting with unsupervised denoising. Since our formulation can be applied to a broad family of SSIM-based measures, we also introduce MicroMS3IM, a microscopy-specific variation of MS-SSIM. The source code and python package is available at https://github.com/juglab/MicroSSIM.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Learning Approach for Intracranial Hemorrhage Prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prognosis after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is influenced by a complex interplay between imaging and tabular data. Rapid and reliable prognosis are crucial for effective patient stratification and informed treatment decision-making. In this study, we aim to enhance image-based prognosis by learning a robust feature representation shared between prognosis and the clinical and demographic variables most highly correlated with it. Our approach mimics clinical decision-making by reinforcing the model to learn valuable prognostic data embedded in the image. We propose a 3D multi-task image model to predict prognosis, Glasgow Coma Scale and age, improving accuracy and interpretability. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art baseline image models, and demonstrates superior performance in ICH prognosis compared to four board-certified neuroradiologists using only CT scans as input. We further validate our model with interpretability saliency maps. Code is available at https://github.com/MiriamCobo/MultitaskLearning_ICH_Prognosis.git.</description>

      <title>A Disease-Specific Foundation Model Using Over 100K Fundus Images: Release and Validation for Abnormality and Multi-Disease Classification on Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence applied to retinal images offers significant potential for recognizing signs and symptoms of retinal conditions and expediting the diagnosis of eye diseases and systemic disorders. However, developing generalized artificial intelligence models for medical data often requires a large number of labeled images representing various disease signs, and most models are typically task-specific, focusing on major retinal diseases. In this study, we developed a Fundus-Specific Pretrained Model (Image+Fundus), a supervised artificial intelligence model trained to detect abnormalities in fundus images. A total of 57,803 images were used to develop this pretrained model, which achieved superior performance across various downstream tasks, indicating that our proposed model outperforms other general methods. Our Image+Fundus model offers a generalized approach to improve model performance while reducing the number of labeled datasets required. Additionally, it provides more disease-specific insights into fundus images, with visualizations generated by our model. These disease-specific foundation models are invaluable in enhancing the performance and efficiency of deep learning models in the field of fundus imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools utilizing deep learning have shown promise, their generalization to diverse clinical settings remains poorly assessed. This study evaluates the generalization capabilities of a CAD model for malaria diagnosis from thin blood smear images across four sites. We explore strategies to enhance generalization, including fine-tuning and incremental learning. Our results demonstrate that incorporating site-specific data significantly improves model performance, paving the way for broader clinical application.</description>

      <title>HistoGym: A Reinforcement Learning Environment for Histopathological Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pathological research, education, and clinical practice, the decision-making process based on pathological images is critically important. This significance extends to digital pathology image analysis: its adequacy is demonstrated by the extensive information contained within tissue structures, which is essential for accurate cancer classification and grading. Additionally, its necessity is highlighted by the inherent requirement for interpretability in the conclusions generated by algorithms. For humans, determining tumor type and grade typically involves multi-scale analysis, which presents a significant challenge for AI algorithms. Traditional patch-based methods are inadequate for modeling such complex structures, as they fail to capture the intricate, multi-scale information inherent in whole slide images. Consequently, there is a pressing need for advanced AI techniques capable of efficiently and accurately replicating this complex analytical process. To address this issue, we introduce HistoGym, an open-source reinforcement learning environment for histopathological image analysis. Following OpenAI Gym APIs, HistoGym aims to foster whole slide image diagnosis by mimicking the real-life processes of doctors. Leveraging the pyramid feature of WSIs and the OpenSlide API, HistoGym provides a unified framework for various clinical tasks, including tumor detection and classification. We detail the observation, action, and reward specifications tailored for the histopathological image analysis domain and provide an open-source Python-based interface for both clinicians and researchers. To accommodate different clinical demands, we offer various scenarios for different organs and cancers, including both WSI-based and selected region-based scenarios, showcasing several noteworthy results.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Algorithm Re-engineering of Retinal Circuit for Intelligent Object Motion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in retinal neuroscience have fueled various hardware and algorithmic efforts to develop retina-inspired solutions for computer vision tasks. In this work, we focus on a fundamental visual feature within the mammalian retina, Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS). Using DVS data from EV-IMO dataset, we analyze the performance of an algorithmic implementation of OMS circuitry for motion segmentation in presence of ego-motion. This holistic analysis considers the underlying constraints arising from the hardware circuit implementation. We present novel CMOS circuits that implement OMS functionality inside image sensors, while providing run-time re-configurability for key algorithmic parameters. In-sensor technologies for dynamical environment adaptation are crucial for ensuring high system performance. Finally, we verify the functionality and re-configurability of the proposed CMOS circuit designs through Cadence simulations in 180nm technology. In summary, the presented work lays foundation for hardware-algorithm re-engineering of known biological circuits to suit application needs.</description>

      <title>Pre-processing and Compression: Understanding Hidden Representation Refinement Across Imaging Domains via Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations evolve through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations evolves through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that the shape of this ID evolution curve differs noticeably between natural and medical image models: medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</description>

      <title>S$^3$Attention: Improving Long Sequence Attention with Smoothed Skeleton Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention based models have achieved many remarkable breakthroughs in numerous applications. However, the quadratic complexity of Attention makes the vanilla Attention based models hard to apply to long sequence tasks. Various improved Attention structures are proposed to reduce the computation cost by inducing low rankness and approximating the whole sequence by sub-sequences. The most challenging part of those approaches is maintaining the proper balance between information preservation and computation reduction: the longer sub-sequences used, the better information is preserved, but at the price of introducing more noise and computational costs. In this paper, we propose a smoothed skeleton sketching based Attention structure, coined S$^3$Attention, which significantly improves upon the previous attempts to negotiate this trade-off. S$^3$Attention has two mechanisms to effectively minimize the impact of noise while keeping the linear complexity to the sequence length: a smoothing block to mix information over long sequences and a matrix sketching method that simultaneously selects columns and rows from the input matrix. We verify the effectiveness of S$^3$Attention both theoretically and empirically. Extensive studies over Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets and six time-series forecasting show that S$^3$Attention significantly outperforms both vanilla Attention and other state-of-the-art variants of Attention structures.</description>

      <title>HyCoT: Hyperspectral Compression Transformer with an Efficient Training Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression models has recently attracted significant interest. Existing models predominantly utilize convolutional filters, which capture only local dependencies. Furthermore, they often incur high training costs and exhibit substantial computational complexity. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose Hyperspectral Compression Transformer (HyCoT) that is a transformer-based autoencoder for pixelwise HSI compression. Additionally, we introduce an efficient training strategy to accelerate the training process. Experimental results on the HySpecNet-11k dataset demonstrate that HyCoT surpasses the state-of-the-art across various compression ratios by over 1 dB with significantly reduced computational requirements. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycot .</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Generative Models: Enhancing Image Synthesis with VAEs, GANs, and Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines three major generative modelling frameworks: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Stable Diffusion models. VAEs are effective at learning latent representations but frequently yield blurry results. GANs can generate realistic images but face issues such as mode collapse. Stable Diffusion models, while producing high-quality images with strong semantic coherence, are demanding in terms of computational resources. Additionally, the paper explores how incorporating Grounding DINO and Grounded SAM with Stable Diffusion improves image accuracy by utilising sophisticated segmentation and inpainting techniques. The analysis guides on selecting suitable models for various applications and highlights areas for further research.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning motivated by convolutional neural networks has been highly successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification, image segmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and interpretability, not only do we need the predictions made by the model but also how confident it is while making those predictions. This is important in safety critical applications for the people to accept it. In this work, we used an encoder decoder architecture based on variational inference techniques for segmenting brain tumour images. We evaluate our work on the publicly available BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics. Our model is able to segment brain tumours while taking into account both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty in a principled bayesian manner.</description>

      <title>Modeling the HEVC Encoding Energy Using the Encoder Processing Time</title>

Abstract: The global significance of energy consumption of video communication renders research on the energy need of video coding an important task. To do so, usually, a dedicated setup is needed that measures the energy of the encoding and decoding system. However, such measurements are costly and complex. To this end, this paper presents the results of an exhaustive measurement series using the x265 encoder implementation of HEVC and analyzes the relation between encoding time and encoding energy. Finally, we introduce a simple encoding energy estimation model which employs the encoding time of a lightweight encoding process to estimate the encoding energy of complex encoding configurations. The proposed model reaches a mean estimation error of 11.35% when averaged over all presets. The results from this work are useful when the encoding energy estimate is required to develop new energy-efficient video compression algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks for Weakly Supervised Generation and Evaluation of Brain Tumor Segmentations on MR Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) for identifying abnormalities is a leading problem in medical imaging. Using machine learning for this problem generally requires manually annotated ground-truth segmentations, demanding extensive time and resources from radiologists. This work presents a weakly supervised approach that utilizes binary image-level labels, which are much simpler to acquire, to effectively segment anomalies in 2D magnetic resonance images without ground truth annotations. We train a generative adversarial network (GAN) that converts cancerous images to healthy variants, which are used along with localization seeds as priors to generate improved weakly supervised segmentations. The non-cancerous variants can also be used to evaluate the segmentations in a weakly supervised fashion, which allows for the most effective segmentations to be identified and then applied to downstream clinical classification tasks. On the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 dataset, our proposed method generates and identifies segmentations that achieve test Dice coefficients of 83.91%. Using these segmentations for pathology classification results with a test AUC of 93.32% which is comparable to the test AUC of 95.80% achieved when using true segmentations.</description>

      <title>A Bit Stream Feature-Based Energy Estimator for HEVC Software Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The total energy consumption of today's video coding systems is globally significant and emphasizes the need for sustainable video coder applications. To develop such sustainable video coders, the knowledge of the energy consumption of state-of-the-art video coders is necessary. For that purpose, we need a dedicated setup that measures the energy of the encoding and decoding system. However, such measurements are costly and laborious. To this end, this paper presents an energy estimator that uses a subset of bit stream features to accurately estimate the energy consumption of the HEVC software encoding process. The proposed model reaches a mean estimation error of 4.88% when averaged over presets of the x265 encoder implementation. The results from this work help to identify properties of encoding energy-saving bit streams and, in turn, are useful for developing new energy-efficient video coding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Motion-compensated MR CINE reconstruction with reconstruction-driven motion estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cardiac CINE, motion-compensated MR reconstruction (MCMR) is an effective approach to address highly undersampled acquisitions by incorporating motion information between frames. In this work, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the MCMR problem and a more integrated and efficient solution to the MCMR field. Contrary to state-of-the-art (SOTA) MCMR methods which break the original problem into two sub-optimization problems, i.e. motion estimation and reconstruction, we formulate this problem as a single entity with one single optimization. Our approach is unique in that the motion estimation is directly driven by the ultimate goal, reconstruction, but not by the canonical motion-warping loss (similarity measurement between motion-warped images and target images). We align the objectives of motion estimation and reconstruction, eliminating the drawbacks of artifacts-affected motion estimation and therefore error-propagated reconstruction. Further, we can deliver high-quality reconstruction and realistic motion without applying any regularization/smoothness loss terms, circumventing the non-trivial weighting factor tuning. We evaluate our method on two datasets: 1) an in-house acquired 2D CINE dataset for the retrospective study and 2) the public OCMR cardiac dataset for the prospective study. The conducted experiments indicate that the proposed MCMR framework can deliver artifact-free motion estimation and high-quality MR images even for imaging accelerations up to 20x, outperforming SOTA non-MCMR and MCMR methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation across all experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/JZPeterPan/MCMR-Recon-Driven-Motion.</description>

      <title>Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Performance and Non-adversarial Robustness of the Segment Anything Model 2 in Surgical Video Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully supervised deep learning (DL) models for surgical video segmentation have been shown to struggle with non-adversarial, real-world corruptions of image quality including smoke, bleeding, and low illumination. Foundation models for image segmentation, such as the segment anything model (SAM) that focuses on interactive prompt-based segmentation, move away from semantic classes and thus can be trained on larger and more diverse data, which offers outstanding zero-shot generalization with appropriate user prompts. Recently, building upon this success, SAM-2 has been proposed to further extend the zero-shot interactive segmentation capabilities from independent frame-by-frame to video segmentation. In this paper, we present a first experimental study evaluating SAM-2's performance on surgical video data. Leveraging the SegSTRONG-C MICCAI EndoVIS 2024 sub-challenge dataset, we assess SAM-2's effectiveness on uncorrupted endoscopic sequences and evaluate its non-adversarial robustness on videos with corrupted image quality simulating smoke, bleeding, and low brightness conditions under various prompt strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that SAM-2, in zero-shot manner, can achieve competitive or even superior performance compared to fully-supervised deep learning models on surgical video data, including under non-adversarial corruptions of image quality. Additionally, SAM-2 consistently outperforms the original SAM and its medical variants across all conditions. Finally, frame-sparse prompting can consistently outperform frame-wise prompting for SAM-2, suggesting that allowing SAM-2 to leverage its temporal modeling capabilities leads to more coherent and accurate segmentation compared to frequent prompting.</description>

      <title>UniFed: A Universal Federation of a Mixture of Highly Heterogeneous Medical Image Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in federated learning lies in mixing heterogeneous datasets and classification tasks while minimizing the high communication cost caused by clients as well as the exchange of weight updates with the server over a fixed number of rounds. This results in divergent model convergence rates and performance, which may hinder their deployment in precision medicine. In real-world scenarios, client data is collected from different hospitals with extremely varying components (e.g., imaging modality, organ type, etc). Previous studies often overlooked the convoluted heterogeneity during the training stage where the target learning tasks vary across clients as well as the dataset type and their distributions. To address such limitations, we unprecedentedly introduce UniFed, a universal federated learning paradigm that aims to classify any disease from any imaging modality. UniFed also handles the issue of varying convergence times in the client-specific optimization based on the complexity of their learning tasks. Specifically, by dynamically adjusting both local and global models, UniFed considers the varying task complexities of clients and the server, enhancing its adaptability to real-world scenarios, thereby mitigating issues related to overtraining and excessive communication. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a sequential model transfer mechanism that takes into account the diverse tasks among hospitals and a dynamic task-complexity based ordering. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and convergence time over relevant benchmarks in diagnosing retina, histopathology, and liver tumour diseases under federated learning. Our UniFed code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/UniFed.</description>

      <title>A Mini-Batch Quasi-Newton Proximal Method for Constrained Total-Variation Nonlinear Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the years, computational imaging with accurate nonlinear physical models has drawn considerable interest due to its ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions. However, such nonlinear models are computationally demanding. A popular choice for solving the corresponding inverse problems is accelerated stochastic proximal methods (ASPMs), with the caveat that each iteration is expensive. To overcome this issue, we propose a mini-batch quasi-Newton proximal method (BQNPM) tailored to image-reconstruction problems with total-variation regularization. It involves an efficient approach that computes a weighted proximal mapping at a cost similar to that of the proximal mapping in ASPMs. However, BQNPM requires fewer iterations than ASPMs to converge. We assess the performance of BQNPM on three-dimensional inverse-scattering problems with linear and nonlinear physical models. Our results on simulated and real data show the effectiveness and efficiency of BQNPM,</description>

      <title>Personalized Predictions of Glioblastoma Infiltration: Mathematical Models, Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Multimodal Scans</title>

Abstract: Predicting the infiltration of Glioblastoma (GBM) from medical MRI scans is crucial for understanding tumor growth dynamics and designing personalized radiotherapy treatment plans.Mathematical models of GBM growth can complement the data in the prediction of spatial distributions of tumor cells. However, this requires estimating patient-specific parameters of the model from clinical data, which is a challenging inverse problem due to limited temporal data and the limited time between imaging and diagnosis. This work proposes a method that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate patient-specific parameters of a reaction-diffusion PDE model of GBM growth from a single 3D structural MRI snapshot. PINNs embed both the data and the PDE into a loss function, thus integrating theory and data. Key innovations include the identification and estimation of characteristic non-dimensional parameters, a pre-training step that utilizes the non-dimensional parameters and a fine-tuning step to determine the patient specific parameters. Additionally, the diffuse domain method is employed to handle the complex brain geometry within the PINN framework. Our method is validated both on synthetic and patient datasets, and shows promise for real-time parametric inference in the clinical setting for personalized GBM treatment.</description>

      <title>PEANO-ViT: Power-Efficient Approximations of Non-Linearities in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on hardware platforms, specially Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), presents many challenges, which are mainly due to the substantial computational and power requirements of their non-linear functions, notably layer normalization, softmax, and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). These critical functions pose significant obstacles to efficient hardware implementation due to their complex mathematical operations and the inherent resource count and architectural limitations of FPGAs. PEANO-ViT offers a novel approach to streamlining the implementation of the layer normalization layer by introducing a division-free technique that simultaneously approximates the division and square root function. Additionally, PEANO-ViT provides a multi-scale division strategy to eliminate division operations in the softmax layer, aided by a Pade-based approximation for the exponential function. Finally, PEANO-ViT introduces a piece-wise linear approximation for the GELU function, carefully designed to bypass the computationally intensive operations associated with GELU. In our comprehensive evaluations, PEANO-ViT exhibits minimal accuracy degradation (&lt;= 0.5% for DeiT-B) while significantly enhancing power efficiency, achieving improvements of 1.91x, 1.39x, 8.01x for layer normalization, softmax, and GELU, respectively. This improvement is achieved through substantial reductions in DSP, LUT, and register counts for these non-linear operations. Consequently, PEANO-ViT enables efficient deployment of Vision Transformers on resource- and power-constrained FPGA platforms.</description>
