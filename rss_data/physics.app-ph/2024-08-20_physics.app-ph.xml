      <title>Demonstrating a Bi-directional Asymmetric Frequency Conversion in Nonlinear Phononic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the constraints of conservative systems, altering wave propagation frequency emerges as a crucial factor across diverse physical domains. This Letter demonstrates bi-directional asymmetric frequency conversion -- either upward or downward -- depending on the excitation direction in the elastic domain, moving beyond uni-directional approaches. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate its practical realization in a model system of cylindrical beam crystals, a type of granular crystal characterized by intrinsic local resonance. This novel wave transport mechanism operates through the interplay of nonlinear contact, spatial asymmetry, and the coupling of local resonance. Thanks to the proposed highly tunable architecture, we demonstrate various ways to manipulate wave transport, including tunable frequency conversion. Given that the local resonance we employ exemplifies avoided crossings (i.e., a strong coupling effect), our work may inspire investigations into diverse physical nonlinear domains that support material/structural resonance.</description>

      <title>Rapid quench annealing of Er implanted Si for quantum networking applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium implanted silicon (Er:Si) is a promising platform for quantum networking applications, but a major obstacle is the formation of multiple Er centres. We show that the previously identified cubic centre (Er-C) has C2v or lower symmetry. Using crystal field analysis of Er-C and other Er centres, and by comparison with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, we show that Er centres can be arranged in a sequence, ranging from entirely Si coordinated, through mixed Si and oxygen (O) coordination, to entirely O coordinated. G-factors calculated from our crystal field fitting closely match those determined by Zeeman splitting and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. We co-implanted Si with Er and O (each to a concentration of 1019 cm-3). By increasing the quenching rate of the subsequent thermal anneal from ~100 {\deg}C/s to ~1000 {\deg}C/s, we change the dominant optically active centre, formed from Er2O3 clusters to the less energetically favourable Er-C centre with mixed Si and O coordination. Temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) shows that Er2O3 clusters and Er-C centres have an O-related defect state at ~200 and 90 meV above the 4I13/2 Er manifold, respectively. PL lifetime measurements show that the Er2O3 clusters and Er-C centres fall into two or three classes, characterised by different non-radiative PL decay rates. Our high quench rate annealing process could facilitate the formation of a single, optically active Er centre, which is preferable for quantum networking applications of Er:Si.</description>

      <title>Transient current responses of organic electrochemical transistors by vertical ionic diffusion and electrolyte resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the successful implementation of organic electrochemical transistors in neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and real-time sensing applications it is essential to understand the factors that influence device switching times. Here we describe a physical-electrochemical model of the transient response to a step of the gate voltage. The model incorporates (1) ion diffusion inside the channel that governs the electronic conductivity, (2) horizontal electron transport, and (3) the external elements (capacitance, ionic resistance) of the ion dynamics in the electrolyte. We find a general expression of two different time constants that determine the vertical insertion process in terms of the kinetic parameters, in addition to the electronic transit time. We thus obtain a generalization of Bernards-Malliaras model for the exponential transient, as well as a more general set of nonlinear equations that explain the large perturbation effects. The basic model is confirmed by detailed simulations that enable to visualize the different ions distributions and dynamics.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional stepped chain of beads as a broadband acoustic diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric transmission of waves has received considerable attention in the last few decades, inspired by numerous applications in the domains of optics and wave communications. A possible way to achieve such asymmetry in wave propagation is through the violation of reciprocity. We explore asymmetric propagation in an acoustic diode (AD) made of two segments of equal sphere sizes but different elastic properties, in which both chains obey Hertzian's contact law. In the forward configuration, the first chain acts as the nonlinear medium, ensuring the suitable generation of a self-demodulated signal, while the second chain, made of soft spheres, provides the low-pass filter. It is shown that both large nonlinearity and low dispersion cause the smallest distortion of the wave envelope, therefore optimizing the transmission of information through the system.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological edge modes in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential weakness of topological waveguides is that they act on a fixed narrow band of frequencies. However, by 3D printing samples from a photo-responsive polymer, we can obtain a device whose operating frequency can be fine-tuned dynamically using laser excitation. This greatly enhances existing static tunability strategies, typically based on modifying the geometry. We use a version of the classical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study of a Monolayered Vibroacoustic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a vibroacoustic phononic metamaterial system composed of repeated monolayered membrane-air cavity unit-cells to assess its efficacy in controlling sound waves. Assuming low-frequency axisymmetric modes, the coupled membrane-cavity vibroacoustic system for a representative unit-cell is solved entirely analytically. Unlike previous research that relied on an infinite series of eigenfunctions, our analysis offers a single-term exact solution for the membrane's displacement field, fully accounting for coupling with the acoustic cavities. Utilizing the transfer matrix method and the Bloch-Floquet theorem, we offer a comprehensive analytical characterization of the band structure, including closed-form analytical expressions for determining the bounding frequencies of the bandgaps and the dispersion branches. Interaction between Bragg and local resonance bandgaps is examined by adjusting Bragg bandgap positions, with detailed mathematical descriptions provided for their overlapping and transition. Additionally, a "plasma bandgap" analogous to metallic plasma oscillations is identified, with a derived analytical expression for its frequency. First two passbands remain robust against cavity depth variations, limiting wave manipulation capabilities. Analysis of the finite phononic system involves constructing the global transfer matrix to study natural frequencies and scattering coefficients. Interaction between Bragg and local resonance bandgaps in finite systems results in ultra-narrow passbands, creating transparency windows analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency by quantum interference. This theoretical framework enables precise characterization and engineering of bandgaps in the monolayered vibroacoustic phononic metamaterial, highlighting its potential for controlling low-frequency sound wave propagation across multiple frequencies.</description>

      <title>Analytical and experimental results: creation of a duffing acoustic nonlinear oscillator at low amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics have long been exploited in order to damp vibrations in solid mechanics. The phenomenon of irreversible energy transfer from a linear primary system to a nonlinear absorber has driven great attention to the optimal design of vibration absorbers both for stationary and transient regimes. Recently, the same principle has also been targeted in acoustics for the absorption of sound waves at high excitation amplitudes. Meanwhile, acoustic absorption by electro-active means has found great success for noise reduction in the linear regime. This study uses a method allowing the design of nonlinear resonators at amplitudes that typically induce linear behaviors. This research proposes an analytical study of the implementation of the duffing equation as a nonlinear electroacoustic resonator coupled to an acoustic mode of a tube. Experiments are carried out and compared to the analytical results. The experimental implementation is done using a real-time-based algorithm retrieving the measured pressure from a microphone and giving the electrical current to send to a loudspeaker as an output thanks to a Runge-Kutta-like algorithm.</description>

      <title>Volatile MoS${_2}$ Memristors with Lateral Silver Ion Migration for Artificial Neuron Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have shown enhanced ion migration capabilities along their van der Waals (vdW) gaps and on their surfaces. This effect can be employed for resistive switching (RS) in devices for emerging memories, selectors, and neuromorphic computing. To date, all lateral molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$)-based volatile RS devices with silver (Ag) ion migration have been demonstrated using exfoliated, single-crystal MoS${_2}$ flakes requiring a forming step to enable RS. Here, we present volatile RS with multilayer MoS${_2}$ grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with repeatable forming-free operation. The devices show highly reproducible volatile RS with low operating voltages of approximately 2 V and fast switching times down to 130 ns considering their micrometer scale dimensions. We investigate the switching mechanism based on Ag ion surface migration through transmission electron microscopy, electronic transport modeling, and density functional theory. Finally, we develop a physics-based compact model and explore the implementation of our volatile memristors as artificial neurons in neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Shaping of Multi-Touch Stimuli by Programmable Acoustic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials are artificial structures, often lattice of resonators, with unusual properties. They can be engineered to stop wave propagation in specific frequency bands. Once manufactured, their dispersive qualities remain invariant in time and space, limiting their practical use. Actively tuned arrangements have received growing interest to address this issue. Here, we introduce a new class of active metamaterial made from dual-state unit cells, either vibration sources when powered or passive resonators when left disconnected. They possess self-tuning capabilities, enabling deep subwavelength band gaps to automatically match the carrier signal of powered cells, typically around 200Hz. Swift electronic commutations between both states establish the basis for real-time reconfiguration of waveguides and shaping of vibration patterns. A series of experiments highlight how these tailored acceleration fields can spatially encode information relevant to human touch. This novel metamaterial can readily be made using off-the-shelf smartphone vibration motors, paving the way for a widespread adoption of multi-touch tactile displays.</description>

      <title>Wirelessly charged AA battery with a curved receiving coil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer is one of key drivers in modern consumer electronics, as it allows enhancing the convenience and usability of many devices. However, in most cases wireless charging is accessible only to devices developed with such a functionality in mind or at least to gadgets with standard charging connectors, such as USB type-C. We propose the design of a rechargeable battery having the size and output voltage characteristics of a standard AA battery, but supporting magnetic wireless power transfer from charging stations of widely used Qi standard. In our numerical simulations, we study the magnetic field distributions and scattering parameters of the introduced battery with a curved receiving coil coupled to a planar transmitting coil. The obtained results are supported by an experimental realization of the proposed design and a study of the prototype characteristics. The developed battery design facilitates the possibility of adding wireless charging functionality to a wide range of electronic devices in a universal way.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Spin Logics and High-density Multistate Memory in a Single Spin-orbit Torque Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonvolatile devices based on the spin-orbit torque (SOT) mechanism are highly suitable for in-memory logic operations. The current objective is to enhance the memory density of memory cells while performing logic operations within the same memory unit. Present study demonstrates that integrating SOT with an out-of-plane magnetic field effectively achieves multiple magnetic states in perpendicularly magnetized heterostructures. This study further explores this approach, experimentally demonstrating reconfigurable logic operations within a single SOT device using W/Pt/Co/AlOxheterostructures. Our results show that multistate tuning by SOT integration with out-of-plane magnetic field enables reconfigurable logic operations, including AND, OR, NOR, NAND, and Always ON, within a single device. Additionally, we found that careful selection of input logic operations allows multiple configurations to achieve the same logic function within a single memory device. To enhance multistate memory density, we proposed and experimentally verified a two-step writing process, achieving the highest reported multistate memory density in SOT-based memory devices. These findings highlight the potential of integrating SOT and magnetic field effects to realize high-density, multifunctional in-memory logic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.</description>

      <title>How to cleave cubic perovskite oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfaces of cubic perovskite oxides attract significant attention for their physical tunability and high potential for technical applications. Bulk-terminated surfaces are desirable for theoretical modelling and experimental reproducibility, yet there is a lack of methods for preparing such well-defined surfaces. We discuss a method for strain-assisted cleaving of perovskite single crystals, using a setup easily transferable between different experimental systems. The details of the cleaving device and the procedure were optimized in a systematic study on the model SrTiO$_3$. The large-area morphology and typical distribution of surface terminations on cleaved SrTiO$_3$(001) is presented, with specific guidelines on how to distinguish well-cleaved surfaces from conchoidally fractured ones. The cleaving is applicable to other cubic perovskites, as demonstrated on KTaO$_3$(001) and BaTiO$_3$(001). This approach opens up a pathway for obtaining high-quality surfaces of this promising class of materials.</description>

      <title>From Urban Clusters to Megaregions: Mapping Australia's Evolving Urban Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs percolation theory to investigate the hierarchical organisation of Australian urban centres through the connectivity of their road networks. The analysis demonstrates how discrete urban clusters have developed into integrated regional entities, delineating the pivotal distance thresholds that regulate these urban transitions. The study reveals the interconnections between disparate urban clusters, shaped by their functional differentiation and historical development. Furthermore, the study identifies a dichotomy of urban agglomeration forces and a persistent spatial disconnection between Australia's wider urban landscape. This highlights the interplay between urban densification and peripheral growth. It suggests the need for new thinking on potential integrated governance structures that bridge urban development with broader social and economic policies across regional and national scales. Additionally, the study emphasises the growing importance of national coordination in Australian urban development planning to ensure regional consistency, equity, and productivity.</description>

      <title>Squeezed Light via Exciton-Phonon Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light is a particularly useful quantum resource, which finds broad applications in quantum information processing, quantum metrology and sensing, and biological measurements. It has been successfully generated in various physical systems. Here we introduce a new mechanism and system to produce squeezed light using an exciton-phonon cavity-QED system. Specifically, we adopt a semiconductor microcavity embedded with a quantum well, which supports both linear and nonlinear interactions among excitons, phonons, and cavity photons. We show that the strong exciton-phonon nonlinear interaction can induce a quadrature-squeezed cavity output field, and reveal an important role of the exciton-photon coupling in engineering the squeezing spectrum and improving the robustness of the squeezing against thermal noise. Our results indicate that room-temperature squeezing of light is possible for materials with high exciton binding energy.</description>

      <title>Atomic Engineering of Triangular Nanopores in Monolayer hBN: A Decoupled Seeding and Growth Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopores in 2D materials are of significant interest in advanced membrane technologies aimed at the sensing and separation of ions and molecules. These applications necessitate 2D nanopores that are precise in size and shape, and abundant in number. However, conventional fabrication techniques often struggle to achieve both high precision and throughput. In this study, we introduce a decoupled seeding and growth approach designed to overcome this limitation. The method allows the controlled fabrication of ensembles of nanopores with narrow size distribution and is demonstrated for free-standing monolayer hexagonal boron nitride. Using light ion showering, we first create vacancy defect seeds. These seeds are then expanded into triangular nanopores through element-specific preferential atom removal under broad-beam electron irradiation in a transmission electron microscope. Nanopore density and size are controlled by the ion and electron irradiation doses, respectively. During the electron irradiation step, high-resolution imaging allows real-time tracking of the nanopore formation process, enabling the highest level of control. An additional workflow is introduced using thermal annealing in air for the nanopore growth step, delivering the most flexible platform for nanopore fabrication over larger areas with the significant benefit of concurrently removing surface hydrocarbon contamination to mitigate pore clogging and distortion. This study provides researchers with a novel approach to create ensembles of meticulously designed nanopores with well-controlled size and geometry, facilitating the development of next-generation membrane devices that will demand high precision and high throughput nanopore fabrication pipelines.</description>

Abstract: We describe the design, construction and characterisation of paper based devices to perform spirometry, a standard test for lung function assessment. In this device the instantaneous flowrate of the incoming breath from a person gets transformed to a specific acoustic frequency. In this manner, the time course of the persons breath profile is mapped to a time varying acoustic signal. The captured acoustic signal can be converted to standard spirometry curves and relevant parameters can be extracted as we describe in this paper. We compared our device with commercially available devices and showed that these paper based devices provide similar performance. These devices have advantage of low cost and simplicity of operation compared to currently available commercial products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical multiplexing is a key technique that enhances the capacity of optical systems by independently modulating various optical parameters to carry distinct information. Among these parameters, wavelength, polarization, and angle are the primary ones for multiplexing in plane waves with uniform cross-sectional distribution. While metasurfaces have recently emerged as a powerful platform for optical multiplexing, they are typically restricted to partial parameter multiplexing and exhibit a low number of multiplexing channels. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the full-parameter multiplexing of polarization, wavelength, and angle, achieving hundreds of distinct multiplexing channels,the largest reported to date. Our design utilizes a gradient-based optimization algorithm to enable high-efficiency performance and independent functionalities with minimal cross-talk among channels. This approach represents a significant advancement in metasurface design and optical multiplexing, with potential applications in complex and dynamic optical systems.</description>

      <title>0ptical trapping with optical magnetic field and photonic Hall effect forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical trapping is having ever-increasing impact in science $-$ particularly biophysics, photonics and most recently in quantum optomechanics $-$ owing to its superior capability for manipulating nanoscale structures and materials. However, essentially all experimental optical trapping studies in the optical dipole regime have, to date, been dominated by the interaction between a material's electric polarizability, $\alpha_{e}$, and the electric part of the incident electromagnetic field, and therefore described by electric field intensity gradient forces. Optical trapping based on optical magnetic light-matter interactions has not been experimentally addressed despite it's immediate extension of the boundaries of optical trapping research and applications. This paper addresses this long-standing deficiency through the realization of optical magnetic trapping of large index of refraction (i.e., Si) nanoparticles and also presents a formalism for quantitative understanding of the experimental findings. Our experimental optical trapping results require including optical magnetic polarizability, $\alpha_{m}$, and electric-magnetic scattering forces associated with the Photonic Hall effect that are qualitatively and quantitatively validated by Maxwell stress tensor calculations. Our findings bring new opportunities for nanoparticle manipulation, potentially relax the limitations Ashkin claimed based on the optical Earnshaw's theorem, motivate optical matter formation by optical magnetic interactions, and suggest new N-body effects and symmetry breaking to drive dynamics of optical matter systems.</description>

Abstract: We extend Babinet's relations, which are originally derived for transmissive metasurfaces, to reflective metasurfaces embedding planar metallic structures in a substrate containing a reflection mirror. To verify the extended Babinet's relations, we investigate two types of reflective metasurfaces embedding self-complementary structures, which produce $\pi$-phase difference between two orthogonal linear polarizations under specific conditions required for the extended Babinet's relations. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate a metasurface-based half-wave plate with a reflective metasurface including single self-complementary structures in the terahertz regions. In addition, we study a reflective metasurface with embedded self-complementary structures with phase gradient in reflection, and demonstrate simultaneous implementation of anomalous reflection and polarization conversion with high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sputtered Aluminum Nitride Waveguides for the Telecommunication Spectrum with less than 0.16 dB/cm Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of photonic waveguides from sputtered aluminum nitride (AlN). The AlN films were deposited on 6" silicon substrates with a 3 $\mu$m buried silicon oxide layer using reactive DC magnetron sputtering at a temperature of 700{\deg}C. The resulting uncladded polycrystalline waveguides exhibit propagation losses of 0.137 $\pm$ 0.005 dB/cm at wavelengths of 1310 nm and 0.154 $\pm$ 0.008 dB/cm at a wavelength of 1550 nm in the TE polarization. These results are the best reported for sputtered AlN waveguides in the C-band and the first report in the O-band. These performances are comparable to those of the best-reported AlN waveguides, which are epitaxially grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on sapphire substrates. Our findings highlight the potential of sputtered AlN for photonic platforms working in the telecom spectrum.</description>

Abstract: The participation of oxygen or other anionic species in redox activities in cathode materials for lithium and sodium-ion battery systems is known to play a role in governing the useful capacity of these batteries. Directly probing anionic redox mechanisms is not possible, rather the computational analysis by density functional theory poses the main approach towards gleaning insights into anionic redox activity and harnessing these effects to maximize capacity in future electrode materials. Here we showcase material systems exhibiting this mechanism of ion insertion and removal, and present the key computational considerations in studying anionic redox activities in battery materials. Aided by new computationally derived understandings of the role of anionic redox in emerging battery materials, increasingly greater levels of useable capacities can be extracted through informed materials design.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Spectral and Directional Emissivity of Functionalized Laser Processed Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of methods to control the directional and spectral characteristics of thermal radiation from metallic surfaces is a critical factor enabling many important thermal management applications. In this paper, we study the thermal emission properties of functionalized aluminum surfaces produced through femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP). These types of surfaces have recently been found to exhibit near-unity broadband omnidirectional emissivity. However, their ultrabroadband absorption response includes visible and near-infrared (IR) radiation, in addition to the mid-IR range, which limits their use as daytime passive radiative cooling devices. Here, we present ways to solve this problem by demonstrating a new design that uses a dielectric Bragg visible light reflector to accurately control the thermal emission spectra of the FLSP surface with the goal of achieving high performance daytime radiative cooling operation. In addition, we propose other designs based on dielectric multilayer structures to further tailor and control the spectra and thermal emission angles of the FLSP surfaces leading to narrowband and broadband directional thermal radiation. The presented photonic engineering approach combined with FLSP structures will be beneficial to various emerging applications, such as radiative cooling, thermal sensing, and thermophotovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband Coherent Perfect Absorption with Composite Graphene Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the design and performance of a new multilayer graphene metasurface for achieving ultrabroadband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) in the THz regime. The proposed structure comprises of three graphene patterned metasurfaces separated by thin dielectric spacer layers. The top and bottom metasurfaces have cross shape unit cells with varying sizes, while the middle graphene metasurface is square-shaped. This distinctive geometrical asymmetry and the presence of multiple layers within the structure facilitate the achievement of wideband asymmetric reflection under incoherent illumination. This interesting property serves as a crucial step towards achieving near-total absorption under coherent illumination across a broad frequency range. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the absorption efficiency surpasses 90% across an ultrabroadband frequency range from 2.8 to 5.7 THz, i.e., bandwidth of 2.9 THz. The CPA effect can be selectively tuned by manipulating the phase difference between the two incident coherent beams. Moreover, the absorption response can be dynamically adjusted by altering the Fermi level of graphene. The study also examines the influence of geometric parameters on the absorption characteristics. The results of this research work offer valuable insights into the design of broadband graphene metasurfaces for coherent absorption applications, and they contribute to the advancement of sophisticated optical devices operating in the THz frequency range.</description>

Abstract: We propose a quantum memory based on the pre-created long-lived macroscopic quantum coherence. It is shown that the proposed approach provides new physical properties and methods for retrieval of the signal light fields and improvement of the basic parameters of quantum memory. We demonstrate how the pre-created coherence can enable quantum storage with low quantum noise, programmable and on demand retrieval of signal light fields in atomic ensembles with natural inhomogeneous broadening. The feasibility of implementing this proposal in various crystals doped with rare earth ions, as well as in atomic gases with a Raman transition indicates a new way for the development of optical quantum memory.</description>

Abstract: We present a general fabrication strategy for freestanding single-crystalline complex oxide device arrays via wet chemical etching-based microfabrication processes and epitaxial lift-off. Here, we used 0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$)O$_3$-0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.7}$Ti$_{0.3}$)O$_3$ (BCZT) as a model relaxor ferroelectric oxide system and La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ as the sacrificial layer for demonstration. Arrays of SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) / BCZT / SRO ferroelectric capacitor mesas were first defined and isolated on the growth wafer, and then they were released using epitaxial lift-off with lithography-defined surrounding etching holes, after which the freestanding device arrays were integrated onto a glass substrate. Our proposed strategy sheds light on preparing various freestanding single-crystalline oxide devices and paves the way for their heterogeneous integration onto arbitrary substates.</description>

      <title>Edge detection imaging by quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have revolutionized analog computing and image processing at sub-wavelength scales with faster speed and lower power consumption. They typically involve spatial differentiation with engineered angular dispersion. Quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for tailoring properties of optical resonances. While quasi-BICs have been explored in various applications that require high $Q$-factors and enhanced field confinement, their full potential in image processing remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate edge detection imaging by leveraging a quasi-BIC in an all-dielectric metasurface. This metasurface, composed of four nanodisks per unit cell, supports a polarization-independent quasi-BIC through structural perturbations, allowing simultaneously engineering $Q$-factor and angular dispersion. Importantly, we find that with suitable parameters, this quasi-BIC metasurface can perform isotropic two-dimensional spatial differentiation, which is the core element for realizing edge detection. Following the theoretical design, we fabricate the metasurfaces on the silicon-on-insulator platform and experimentally validate their capability of high-quality, efficient, and uniform edge detection imaging under different incident polarizations. Our results illuminate the mechanisms of edge detection with quasi-BIC metasurfaces and highlight new opportunities for their application in ultra-compact, low-power optical computing devices.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Non-Volatile On-Chip Bragg Filter with Multilevel Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) demand tailored spectral responses for various applications. On-chip Bragg filters offer a promising solution, yet their static nature hampers scalability. Current tunable filters rely on volatile switching mechanisms plagued by high static power consumption and thermal crosstalk. Here, we introduce, for the first time, a non-volatile, electrically programmable on-chip Bragg filter. This device incorporates a nanoscale layer of wide-bandgap phase change material (Sb2S3) atop a periodically structured silicon waveguide. The reversible phase transitions and drastic refractive index modulation of Sb2S3 enable dynamic spectral tuning via foundry-compatible microheaters. Our design surpasses traditional passive Bragg gratings and active volatile filters by offering electrically controlled, reconfigurable spectral responses in a non-volatile manner. The proposed filter achieves a peak reflectivity exceeding 99% and a high tuning range ($\Delta\lambda$=20 nm) when transitioning between the amorphous and crystalline states of Sb2S3. Additionally, we demonstrate quasi-continuous spectral control of the filter stopband by modulating the amorphous/crystalline distribution within Sb2S3. Our approach offers substantial benefits for low-power, programmable PICs, thereby laying the groundwork for prospective applications in optical communications, optical interconnects, microwave photonics, optical signal processing, and adaptive multi-parameter sensing.</description>

Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are time-reversal broken antiferromagnets, where the $z$ component of the N\'{e}el vector is detectable by anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, recently proposed $p$-wave magnets are time-reversal preserved antiferromagnets, and it is a highly nontrivial problem how to detect and control a domain wall. We study a one-dimensional hybrid system made of a $p$-wave magnet and a metal possessing the orbital degree of freedom. The hybrid system is a topological insulator without the spin-orbit interaction. There emerge two edge states per one edge, because the system is mapped to a set of two copies of a topological insulator. Each copy resembles the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but it is topologically different. Topological interface states emerge at a domain wall in the $p$-wave magnet, which are charged due to the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism. Consequently, a domain wall in the $p$-wave magnet will be controllable and detectable purely by electrical means. We also study Majorana fermions induced by proximity coupling of $s$-wave superconductivity and $p$-wave magnet.</description>

      <title>Singular Topological Edge States in Locally Resonant Metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Band topology has emerged as a novel tool for material design across various domains, including photonic and phononic systems, and metamaterials. A prominent model for band topology is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which reveals topological in-gap states within Bragg-type gaps (BG) formed by periodic modification. Apart from classical BGs, another mechanism for bandgap formation in metamaterials involves strong coupling between local resonances and propagating waves, resulting in a local resonance-induced bandgap (LRG). Previous studies have shown the challenge of topological edge state emergence within the LRG. Here, we reveal that topological edge states can emerge within an LRG by achieving both topological phase and bandgap transitions simultaneously. We describe this using a model of inversion-symmetric extended SSH chains for locally resonant metamaterials. Notably, this topological state can lead to highly localized modes, comparable to a subwavelength unit cell, when it emerges within the LRG. We experimentally demonstrate distinct differences in topologically protected modes -- highlighted by wave localization -- between the BG and the LRG using locally resonant granule-based metamaterials. Our findings suggest the scope of topological metamaterials may be extended via their bandgap nature.</description>

      <title>Optimal Demodulation Domain for Microwave SQUID Multiplexers in Presence of Readout System Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06782</link>

Abstract: The Microwave SQUID Multiplexer ({\mu}MUX) is the device of choice for the readout of a large number of Low-Temperature Detectors in a wide variety of experiments within the fields of astronomy and particle physics. While it offers large multiplexing factors, the system noise performance is highly dependent on the cold and warm-readout electronic systems used to read it out, as well as the demodulation domain and parameters chosen. In order to understand the impact of the readout systems in the overall detection system noise performance, first we extended the available {\mu}MUX simulation frameworks including additive and multiplicative noise sources in the probing tones (i.e. phase and amplitude noise), along with the capability of demodulating the scientific data, either in resonator's phase or scattering amplitude. Then, considering the additive noise as a dominant noise source, the optimum readout parameters to achieve minimum system noise were found for both open-loop and flux-ramp demodulation schemes in the aforementioned domains. Later, we evaluated the system noise sensitivity to multiplicative noise sources under the optimum readout parameters. Finally, as a case study, we evaluated the optimal demodulation domain and expected system noise level for a typical Software-Defined Radio (SDR) readout system. This work leads to an improved system performance prediction and noise engineering based on the available readout electronics and selected demodulation domain.</description>
