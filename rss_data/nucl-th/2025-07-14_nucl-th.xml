      <title>Exact solutions of the nuclear shell-model secular problem: Discrete Non-Orthogonal Shell Model within a Variation After Projection approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of non-orthogonal many-body expansions in the resolution of the nuclear shell-model secular problem. Exact shell-model solutions are obtained within the variational principle using non-orthogonal Slater determinants as the variational ansatz. These results numerically prove the realization of the Broeckhove-Deumens theorem on the existence of a discrete set of non-orthogonal wavefunctions that exactly span the full shell-model space for low-lying states of interest. With the angular-momentum variation after projection, pairing correlations are shown to be fully captured by Slater determinants as exemplified in the backbending phenomenon occurred in $^{48}$Cr. The resulting discrete non-orthogonal shell model developed in such variation after projection method is further examined in the case of $^{78}$Ni, an exotic doubly magic nucleus at the edge of currently feasible diagonalization limits. Its ground state binding energy is shown to converge to a lower value than the largest large-scale shell-model diagonalization ever done by the conventional tridiagonal Lanczos method, revealing an outstanding performance of non-orthogonal Slater determinantal wavefunctions to describe the eigensolutions of shell-model Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach for many-body uncertainties in nuclear structure: Many-body perturbation theory for finite nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive assessment of theoretical uncertainties defines an important frontier in nuclear structure research. Ideally, theory predictions include uncertainty estimates that take into account truncation effects from both the interactions and the many-body expansion. While the uncertainties from the expansion of the interactions within effective field theories have been studied systematically using Bayesian methods, many-body truncations are usually addressed by expert assessment. In this work we use a Bayesian framework to study many-body uncertainties within many-body perturbation theory applied to finite nuclei. Our framework is applied to a broad range of nuclei across the nuclear chart calculated from two- and three-nucleon interactions based on chiral effective field theory. These developments represent a step towards a more complete and systematic quantification of uncertainties in \emph{ab initio} calculations of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-gauge invariant non-equilibrium density operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a form of the local thermodynamic equilibrium density operator which is invariant under pseudo-gauge transformations of the stress-energy and the spin tensors. This operator is an excellent candidate to describe the dynamics of a system which is assumed to achieve local equilibrium from a pseudo-gauge invariant quantum state, a situation which is believed to occur, for instance, in nuclear collisions at very high energy. As a consequence of pseudo-gauge invariance, the ambiguity affecting the predictions of mean values of observables from a local equilibrium state can be removed.</description>

      <title>Light and heavy $\Lambda$ hyperclusters in nuclear matter with RMF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of RMF models, we investigate the properties of light and heavy $\Lambda$ hyperclusters emersed in nuclear matter at various densities $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$ and proton fractions $Y_p$. In particular, the (hyper)clusters are fixed by solving the Dirac equations imposing the Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition, while the nuclear matter take constant densities and is treated with Thomas-Fermi approximation. The binding energies of (hyper)clusters decrease with the density of nuclear matter $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$, which eventually become unbound and melt in the presence of nuclear medium, i.e., Mott transition. For light clusters with proton numbers $N_p &lt; 4$, with the addition of $\Lambda$ hyperons, the binding energies per baryon for $\Lambda$ hyperclusters become smaller and decrease faster with $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$ due to the weaker $N$-$\Lambda$ attraction. For heavy clusters with $N_p \geq 4$, on the contrary, the addition of $\Lambda$ hyperons increases the stability of (hyper)clusters so that the Mott transition density becomes larger as nucleons occupying higher energy states while $\Lambda$ hyperons remain in the $1s_{1/2}$ orbital. The isovector effects on (hyper)clusters in nuclear medium are also identified, where the binding energies for (hyper)clusters with $N_p&gt; N_n$ ($N_p&lt; N_n$) increase (decrease) with $Y_p$. For those predicted by nonlinear relativistic density functionals, light (hyper)clusters are destabilized drastically as $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$ increases, while the binding energies of heavier (hyper)clusters vary smoothly with $n_{\mathrm{gas}}$. By fitting the binding energy shifts to an analytical formula, the corresponding coefficients describing the in-medium properties of various (hyper)clusters are fixed, which should be useful to understand the evolutions of (hyper)clusters in both heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Proton radioactivity in deformed nuclei with microscopic optical potential: a novel angular-dependent emission mechanism in the nanosecond-emitter $^{149}$Lu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first microscopic description of proton radioactivity in $^{149}$Lu, the most oblate deformed proton emitter known, using a deformed $ab\ initio$ optical potential derived from relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. We predict a novel angular-dependent phenomenon unprecedented in spherical proton emitters: the disappearance of classically allowed regions at small polar angles $(\theta\leq 21^\circ)$. Combining the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin penetration probabilities and the assault frequency of the emitted proton estimated with a new harmonic-oscillator-inspired scheme, our framework yields a half-life $T_{1/2}=467^{+143}_{-108}$ ns for $^{149}$Lu, in excellent agreement within uncertainties with the experimental value $450^{+170}_{-100}$ ns. Deformation analysis rigorously excludes configurations with $|\beta_2|\geq 0.32$. Extensions to $^{150, 151}$Lu and their isomers also achieve excellent agreement with experimental half-life data. We further predict $^{148}$Lu as another highly oblate $(\beta_2 = -0.166)$ proton emitter with a half-life of 33 $\mu$s. This work validates deformed microscopic optical potentials as a robust predictive tool for drip-line proton emitters and provides quantitative evidence for deformation effects in exotic decays.</description>

      <title>Composition of Scalar Mesons and Their Effects on Nuclear Matter Properties in an Extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been argued that the iso-scalar and iso-vector mesons play significant roles in nuclear matter and neutron star structures. We improve the extended linear sigma model with baryons, proposed in our previous work, by introducing the flavor structures constructed from antisymmetric tensors of chiral representations to study these physics. The parameter space of this model is refined with well-reproduced nuclear matter properties at saturation density by the lowest order Lagrangian, ensuring consistency with vacuum results, such as $f_\pi \approx 134 \, \text{MeV}$. The anticipated plateau-like behaviors of the symmetry energy are predicted at intermediate densities, which is crucial for the consistency of GW170817 and the neutron skin thickness of $\text{Pb}^{208}$. Subsequently, neutron star structures are calculated using several parameter sets, and the results for the nuclear matter properties at saturation density align with empirical values. It is found that the neutron star structures are sensitive to the couplings between the iso-vector $a_0$ meson and nucleons and the four-vector meson couplings: small values of both are favorable. Meanwhile, nuclear matter properties at saturation density favor larger values of the latter and are not sensitive to the former. This signifies the statistical significance of neutron star observations when obtaining realistic chiral effective field theories or models at various densities. The parameter set favored by neutron star observations also aligns the behavior of the sound velocity with the conformal limit at high densities relevant to cores of massive stars. It is hoped that the results of this work can guide future studies on the relationship between the microscopic symmetry of strong interactions and macroscopic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by DFT calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life for each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ decay via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion, and electron bridge.</description>

      <title>Investigating QCD Dynamical Entropy in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the concept of QCD dynamical entropy is extended to heavy ion systems. This notion of entropy can be understood as a relative entropy and can also be used to estimate the initial entropy density in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The key quantity used to calculate this entropy is the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution (nUGD), which provides a transverse momentum probability density. In the numerical analysis, both the geometric scaling phenomenon and the Glauber-Gribov approach have been used to evaluate realistic models for the nUGD. It is shown that the normalization procedure and the geometric scaling property make the dynamical entropy almost independent of the nucleus mass number $A$. Results are presented for the dynamical entropy density, $dS_D/dy$, in terms of the rapidity.</description>

      <title>Off-shell modifications of the pion generalized parton distributions and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The off-shell characteristics of pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) are examined within the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In our previous papers, we separately investigated the properties of on-shell pion GPDs and light-front wave functions. It is particularly intriguing to compare the differences between on-shell and off-shell pion GPDs, which allows us to explore the effects associated with off-shellness. Due to the absence of crossing symmetry, the moments of GPDs also incorporate odd powers of the skewness parameter, resulting in new off-shell form factors. Through our calculations, we derived correction functions that account for modifications in pion GPDs due to off-shell effects. Unlike their on-shell counterparts, certain properties break down in the off-shell scenario; for instance, symmetry properties and polynomiality conditions may no longer hold. Additionally, we evaluate off-shell TMDs and compare them with their on-shell equivalents while also investigating their dependence on $\bm{k}_{\perp}$.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks: The TQ4Q1.1 functions as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of exotic matter formation via the {\tt TQ4Q1.1} set of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for fully charmed or bottomed tetraquarks in three quantum configurations: scalar ($J^{PC} = 0^{++}$), axial vector ($J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$), and tensor ($J^{PC} = 2^{++}$). We adopt single-parton fragmentation at leading power and implement a nonrelativistic QCD factorization scheme tailored to tetraquark Fock-state configurations. Short-distance inputs at the initial scale are modeled using updated calculations for both gluon- and heavy-quark-initiated channels. A threshold-consistent DGLAP evolution is then applied via HFNRevo. We provide the first systematic treatment of uncertainties propagated from the color-composite long-distance matrix elements that govern the nonperturbative hadronization of tetraquarks. To support phenomenology, we compute NLL/NLO$^+$ cross sections for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC using (sym)JETHAD, incorporating angular multiplicities as key observables sensitive to high-energy QCD dynamics. This work connects the investigation of exotic hadrons with state-of-the-art precision QCD.</description>

      <title>Decoding Two-Particle States in QCD with Spatial Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic way to constructing optimized interpolating operators strongly coupled to QCD two-particle states is developed, which is achieved by incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions. To efficiently implement these operators in lattice QCD, a novel quark smearing technique utilizing noise vectors is proposed. Applied to the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ system, the optimized operators resolve distinct eigenstates separated by only $\sim 5$ MeV near the threshold $2m_{\Omega_{ccc}} \simeq 9700$ MeV. This exceptional resolving power opens new possibilities for studies of a wide range of hadronic systems in QCD.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction-based operator optimization for two-hadron systems in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic way to constructing optimized interpolating operators for two-hadron systems is developed by incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions. The wavefunctions can be obtained from an iterative process with an appropriate initial guess. To implement these operators, a novel quark smearing technique utilizing $Z_3$ noise vectors is proposed, which allows for effectively incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions at the source without using all-to-all quark propagators. Proof-of-principle application to the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ system using physical-point lattice configurations with a large size $La\simeq8.1$~fm shows that optimized operators enables clear identification of states around $2m_{\Omega_{ccc}}\simeq 9700$ MeV with the energy gap as narrow as $\sim 5$ MeV. A comparison on correlation functions, effective energies, and HAL QCD potentials between unoptimized operators and optimized operators is given, with a special emphasis on the effects from nearby elastic scattering states. Potential applicability of the optimized operator to various two-hadron systems and its relation to the variational method are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Nuclear Symmetry Energy from Neutron Star Observations -- In Light of PSR J0614--3329</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark phase transition (FOPT) in neutron-star interiors remains an open question. Whether such a transition can be directly tested with improved observations is a key challenge. Here, we incorporate the latest constraints, especially a new NICER radius measurement for PSR J0614--3329, into a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) EOS framework that explicitly includes a first-order transition. We find a Bayes factor of $B\approx2.3$ when comparing models with and without an explicit phase transition, marginally favoring its presence. At $68\%$ credibility, the transition onset density $n_{\rm PT}$ is either below $2\,n_s$ (corresponding to masses $\lesssim1\,M_\odot$, with density jump $\Delta n\sim0.5\,n_s$) or, more prominently, above $4\,n_s$ (near the central density of the heaviest NS, with $\Delta n\sim3\,n_s$), where $n_s$ represents the nuclear saturation density. In addition, by using symmetry-energy expansion at low densities ($&lt;1.1\,n_s$), we infer a slope parameter $L=40.2^{+19.3}_{-14.3}$ MeV, in good agreement with nuclear-experiment values. Intriguingly, $L$ correlates positively with the radius difference between $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$ stars.</description>

      <title>Quark model of nucleon based on an analogy with polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the polaron theory from solid state physics can serve as an interesting analogue model for non-perturbative QCD, at least in the description of nucleons and related low-energy physics of strong interactions. By drawing explicit analogies between polaron physics, arising for an electron moving in an ionic crystal, and physics of pion-nucleon interactions, certain rules for the "polaron/QCD correspondence" are proposed. In polaron theory, the effective fermion mass as a function of the coupling constant is known both in the weak and strong coupling limits. The conjectured "polaron/QCD correspondence" translates these results into strong interactions. It is then shown how application of these rules leads to unexpectedly good quantitative predictions for the nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon sigma term. The polaron approach also predicts that the quark degrees of freedom in the form of the constituent quark account for one-third of the nucleon mass, consistent with lattice predictions. We discuss possible physical reasons underlying the observed quantitative similarity between polaron physics and non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Stellar properties indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe distinctive stellar features indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars. A strongly negative curvature of the mass-radius relation R(M) is characteristic of hyperons, which can be determined from measurements of neutron stars with three different masses. Similarly, a reduced second derivative of the tidal deformability as function of mass $\lambda(M)$ points to hyperonic degrees of freedom in NS matter. The slopes of such curves R(M) and \lambda(M) can distinguish a hyperonic equation of state from purely nucleonic models if they appear increased (decreased for \lambda(M)) relative to the maximum mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to the thermodynamics of quark-hadron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter where hadrons are treated as bound states of quarks which dissociate at high densities due to quark Pauli blocking. The newly developed approach makes use of a cluster virial expansion formulated in terms of a generalized $\Phi$-derivable approach to multi-quark correlations with bound and continuum states in their spectrum encoded in hadron phase shifts. Our model can be used to obtain thermodynamic functions not only at zero and small chemical potentials, where they are consistent with lattice QCD simulations, but also at large chemical potentials where lattice QCD simulations have the sign problem. By applying a reaction-kinetic criterion for the chemical freeze-out of multi-quark clusters in heavy-ion collisions, we demonstrate that the chemical freeze-out coincides with their Mott transition. The approach can be applied to study the effects of the QCD transition on primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and on hybrid neutron star formation in supernova explosions and binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Odd-Parity $s$-wave $\Xi^*$ States in Femtoscopic Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $\Xi^*$ resonances within the molecular picture, where these states are dynamically generated as poles in the unitarized scattering amplitudes arising from the coupled-channel interactions of $K^{*-} \Lambda$, $K^{*-} \Sigma^0$, $\rho^- \Xi^0$, $\overline{K}{}^{*0} \Sigma^-$, $\rho^0 \Xi^-$, $\omega \Xi^-$, and $\phi \Xi^-$. The interaction kernel is derived from the local hidden gauge formalism, while the unitarization procedure employs a hybrid method that combines cutoff and dimensional regularizations in the evaluation of the loop function. From a detailed spectroscopic analysis, we identify two $S = -2$ baryon states whose properties are compatible with some of the $\Xi^*$ resonances listed in the Review of Particle Physics. To explore their possible experimental signatures, we compute the femtoscopic correlation functions for all the vector-baryon pairs considered in the present study, using realistic estimates of production weights and varying source sizes $R = 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5$ fm.</description>

      <title>A further study on the renormalization group aspect of perturbative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I perform a further study regarding a renormalization-group (RG) issue -- which concerns a wide variety of the so-called perturbative power counting under effective field theories (EFT) -- as pointed out by A. M. Gasparyan and E. Epelbaum [Phys. Rev. C 107, 034001 (2023)]. I show that the issue could originate from a wrong power counting, or from treating those incomplete, truncated amplitudes beyond the degree to which they should be trusted. Meanwhile, under EFT principles, one should always associate the result with an uncertainty that is adequate to its EFT order. One way to accommodate this is to encode its effect in a more general form of contact terms. In this regard, no RG issue is found in the $^3$P$_0$ nucleon-nucleon scattering under the Long and Yang power counting. In contrast, the RG issue under Weinberg's pragmatic proposal remains a problem even with uncertainty taken into account.</description>

      <title>Interference between Meson Exchange and One-Body Currents in Quasielastic Electron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the interference between meson exchange currents (MEC) and one-body currents in quasielastic electron scattering, with a focus on the sign of this interference in the transverse response for one-particle emission. We prove that the interference of both the Delta and pion-in-flight currents with the one-body current is negative, leading to a partial cancellation with the seagull current. This is mathematically demonstrated within the framework of the Fermi gas model. By comparing these interferences across various independent particle models, both relativistic and non-relativistic, our results indicate that all studied models display the same behavior. This consistency suggests that the interference is negative in models that do not incorporate tensor correlations in the nuclear wave function.</description>

      <title>Correlation between U/Th and Pb/Os abundance ratios and its application in nuclear cosmochronology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance ratios of radioactive elements U/Th and stable elements Pb/Os from the $r$-process are found to have a strong correlation. This correlation is quite robust with respect to astrophysical conditions. The U/Th-Pb/Os correlation is then applied to provide customized initial abundance ratios U/Th from the observed abundance ratios Pb/Os for six $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars respectively. Ages of these six metal-poor stars are predicted by the U/Th chronometer, which are approximately between $11$ and $15$ Gyr. Their ages are compatible with the cosmic age of 13.8 billion years predicted from the cosmic microwave background radiation.</description>

      <title>Fully general relativistic description of rapidly-rotating axially-symmetric neutron stars for constraining nuclear matter equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Constraining the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) from neutron star observations is one of the main subjects in nuclear physics today. In general, neutron stars rotate rapidly and structure of neutron stars can be affected, especially in millisecond pulsars. To better constrain the nuclear EoS, it is important to describe neutron star structure taking into account the effects of rotation in a fully relativistic manner. Purpose: In this study, we investigate the internal structure of neutron stars under the influence of rotation. We explore correlations between rotational effects and EoS parameters, based on realistic calculations of rapidly rotating neutron stars based on the KEH method, which provides stable solutions for axially symmetric rotating equilibrium configurations. Results: Using 5 different Skyrme EoS parameter sets, we find that the maximum angular frequency achievable by rotating neutron stars, as calculated via the KEH method, varies depending on the stiffness of the equation of state. We confirm that an increase in the rotating frequency leads to an overall increase in both the mass and radius along the M-R curve. By performing calculations at two frequently referenced neutron stars, we further examine how the changes in mass and radius correlate with the nuclear matter properties at saturation density. Our results suggest that the 716Hz rotational constraint may require a more conservative interpretation when accounting for realistic stellar deformation effects. Conclusions: To place stringent constraints on the nuclear EoS based on observational data, it is sometimes essential to account for the effects of rotation in neutron star models. In particular, the influence of rotation becomes increasingly significant at higher spin frequencies and cannot be neglected in rapidly rotating systems with $&gt;$400Hz.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclear Matter To Dense Compact-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An argument is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be understood in terms of the mechanism referred to as ``pseudo-conformal sound speed" in dense compact-star matter, $v_{\rm pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$. Both pros and cons are presented using an effective field theory anchored on renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's highly successful EFT $\chi$EFT$_\pi$ with the pion field only (in nuclear medium) by implementing heavy-meson degrees of freedom. Both hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter involving the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ ($f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity" is brought in via the topological structure of the nucleon, i.e., skyrmion considered to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The new inputs for the argumentation are the large N limit of the Grassmanian model for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We conclude that, on the whole, the discussion regarding low-energy nuclear physics is confusing and the suggested impact on nuclear structure research is overstated. Conversely, efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy ion experiments.</description>

Abstract: The restoration of dynamical chiral symmetry for a higher number of light-quark flavors $N_f$ implies suppression of the dynamically generated quark mass. The study of various larger values of $N_f$ may have a greater impact on the internal structure of light hadrons. In this work, we study the properties of the $\pi$- (pion) and $K$-meson (kaon), such as the mass, condensate, and leptonic decay constant, for various $N_f$. We use the symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dependent contact interaction model of quark. The dynamical quark masses are calculated using the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). The masses of pion ($m_{\pi}$) and kaon ($m_{K}$) for different values of $N_f$ and are determined using the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation. For fixed $N_c=3$ and $N_f$ is increased, the dynamically generated quark mass $M_{u/d}$ ( mass of up and down quarks), strange quark mass ($M_s$), meson in-condensate $\kappa^{1/3}_{(\pi,K)}$, and decay constant $f_{(\pi, K)}$. monotonically decrease as a function of $N_f$, except for the pion and kaon mass $m_{(\pi, K)}$, which increase above a critical value of $N_f$ around $8$. This is the region where chiral symmetry is restored and the pion and kaon behave as free particles, similar to thier behavior in the the presence of a heat bath. The results obtained for fixed $N_f=2$ and $N_c=3$ are fairly in decent agreement with experimentally calculated statistics and previous model calculations based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rotation effect on the QCD properties is an open question. We study the dynamic gluon mass in a dense QCD matter, the rotation is introduced by taking a covariant transformation between the flat and curved spaces. The law of causality which restricts the rotation strength of the system is carefully considered in the calculation. we find that the rotation effect is not monotonous. Overall, it behaves like an anti-screening effect, reflecting in the decreasing gluon mass, but the strength changes with the rotation. For a QCD matter with low baryon density, the screening effect in the flat space can be completely canceled by the rotation, and gluons are confined in a strongly rotating matter. When the rotation is extremely high, the matter approaches to a weakly interacting gas.</description>

Abstract: I numerically estimate the spacetime profile of the electromagnetic fields produced in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions at $\sqsNN=2.4\,\mathchar`-\,7.7\;{\rm GeV}$ for a wide range of impact parameters $b=0\,\mathchar`-\,9\;{\rm fm}$, using a hadronic cascade model, JAM (Jet AA Microscopic transport model). I demonstrate that (1) the produced electromagnetic fields are as strong as $eE, eB = {\mathcal O}((50\;{\rm MeV})^2)$; (2) that the produced fields extend in spacetime about $V_4 = {\mathcal O}((10\;{\rm fm})^4)$; (3) that the magnetic field dominates around the collision point, while the other broad regions of spacetime are dominated by the electric field; and (4) that a topological electromagnetic-field configuration such that ${\bm E}\cdot {\bm B} \neq 0$ is realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework is utilized to generate $^{197}_{79}Au+^{197}_{79}Au$, $^{96}_{44}Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$, and $^{96}_{40}Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$ collision events at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The CME signal is modulated through the axial charge per entropy density ($n_5/s$) in each event to produce data sets with varying CME signal strengths. Additionally, a 33$\%$ local charge conservation (LCC) is implemented in each event. These data sets are analyzed using CME-sensitive two- and three-particle correlators. Furthermore, the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) is employed to identify potential CME-like events within each data set. The identified events selected using the SDM exhibit characteristics consistent with CME. The CME fraction in these events is quantified while accounting for background contributions.</description>

Abstract: By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>

Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically bosons ($\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$) as well as fermions [$p(\bar p)$], produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including standard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit systematically a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>

      <title>Novel Phases of a Baryon-Dense QCD-like Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phases of a strongly coupled QCD-like theory at finite baryon chemical potential using s-confining supersymmetric QCD deformed by anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Focusing on the case of three colors and four flavors, we identify novel phases including spontaneous breaking of baryon number and/or parity. Both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed as the baryon chemical potential is varied. These findings may offer insights into possible phases of real QCD at intermediate baryon densities.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Amplification for Muon-to-Positron Conversion in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the lepton-number and lepton-flavour-violating process of muon-to-positron conversion $\mu^- + N \rightarrow e^+ + N'$, in the presence of an ultralight scalar dark matter (ULSDM) field which couples to neutrinos. The ULSDM contributes to the effective off-diagonal Majorana mass $ m_{\mu e}$, therefore amplifying the rate of muon-to-positron conversion to experimentally observable levels. Using existing bounds from SINDRUM II, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, we derive constraints on the flavour-off-diagonal couplings of neutrinos to ULSDM for the first time. Our work reveals that upcoming experiments can provide stronger sensitivity to these new couplings than bounds arising from cosmological surveys and terrestrial experiments.</description>
