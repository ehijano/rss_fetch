      <title>Counting spinal phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are an important way to represent evolutionary histories that involve reticulations such as hybridization or horizontal gene transfer, yet fundamental questions such as how many networks there are that satisfy certain properties are very difficult. A new way to encode a large class of networks, using expanding covers, may provide a way to approach such problems. Expanding covers encode a large class of phylogenetic networks, called labellable networks. This class does not include all networks, but does include many familiar classes, including orchard, normal, tree-child and tree-sibling networks. As expanding covers are a combinatorial structure, it is possible that they can be used as a tool for counting such classes for a fixed number of leaves and reticulations, for which, in many cases, a closed formula has not yet been found. More recently, a new class of networks was introduced, called spinal networks, which are analogous to caterpillar trees for phylogenetic trees and can be fully described using covers. In the present article, we describe a method for counting networks that are both spinal and belong to some more familiar class, with the hope that these form a base case from which to attack the more general classes.</description>

      <title>Risk-mediated dynamic regulation of effective contacts de-synchronizes outbreaks in metapopulation epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metapopulation epidemic models help capture the spatial dimension of infectious disease spread by dividing heterogeneous populations into separate but interconnected communities, represented by nodes in a network. In the event of an epidemic, an important research question is, to what degree spatial information (i.e., regional or national) is relevant for mitigation and (local) policymakers. This study investigates the impact of different levels of information on nationwide epidemic outcomes, modeling the reaction to the measured hazard as a feedback loop reducing contact rates in a metapopulation model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Using COVID-19 and high-resolution mobility data for Germany of 2020 as a case study, we found two markedly different regimes depending on the maximum contact reduction $\psi_{\rm max}$: mitigation and suppression. In the regime of (modest) mitigation, gradually increasing $\psi_{\rm max}$ from zero to moderate levels delayed and spread out the onset of infection waves while gradually reducing the peak values. This effect was more pronounced when the contribution of regional information was low relative to national data. In the suppression regime, the feedback-induced contact reduction is strong enough to extinguish local outbreaks and decrease the mean and variance of the peak day distribution, thus regional information was more important. When suppression or elimination is impossible, ensuring local epidemics are desynchronized helps to avoid hospitalization or intensive care bottlenecks by reallocating resources from less-affected areas.</description>

      <title>Sackin Indices for Labeled and Unlabeled Classes of Galled Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sackin index is an important measure for the balance of phylogenetic trees. We investigate two extensions of the Sackin index to the class of galled trees and two of its subclasses (simplex galled trees and normal galled trees) where we consider both labeled and unlabeled galled trees. In all cases, we show that the mean of the Sackin index for a network which is uniformly sampled from its class is asymptotic to $\mu n^{3/2}$ for an explicit constant $\mu$. In addition, we show that the scaled Sackin index convergences weakly and with all its moments to the Airy distribution.</description>

      <title>FREE: The Foundational Semantic Recognition for Modeling Environmental Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our planet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes driven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many variables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often utilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements or modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time period. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of environmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the complex relationships amongst various environmental data over space and time? In this paper, we introduce a framework, FREE, which maps available environmental data into a text space and then converts the traditional predictive modeling task in environmental science to a semantic recognition problem. The proposed framework leverages recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to supplement the original input features with natural language descriptions. This framework facilitates capturing the data semantics and allows harnessing the irregularities of input features. When used for long-term prediction, FREE has the flexibility to incorporate newly collected observations to enhance future prediction. The efficacy of FREE is evaluated in the context of two societally important real-world applications, predicting stream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin and predicting annual corn yield in Illinois and Iowa. Beyond the superior predictive performance over multiple baselines, FREE is shown to be more data- and computation-efficient as it can be pre-trained on simulated data generated by physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Optimal coordination of resources: A solution from reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient allocation is important in nature and human society, where individuals frequently compete for limited resources. The Minority Game (MG) is perhaps the simplest toy model to address this issue. However, most previous solutions assume that the strategies are provided a priori and static, failing to capture their adaptive nature. Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to MG, where individuals adjust decisions based on accumulated experience and expected rewards dynamically. We find that this RL framework achieves optimal resource coordination when individuals balance the exploitation of experience with random exploration. Yet, the imbalanced strategies of the two lead to suboptimal partial coordination or even anti-coordination. Our mechanistic analysis reveals a symmetry-breaking in action preferences at the optimum, offering a fresh solution to the MG and new insights into the resource allocation problem.</description>
