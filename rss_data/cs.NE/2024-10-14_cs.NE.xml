      <title>The Impact of Network Structure on Ant Colony Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a swarm intelligence methodology utilized for solving optimization problems through information transmission mediated by pheromones. As ants sequentially secrete pheromones that subsequently evaporate, the information conveyed predominantly comprises pheromones secreted by recent ants. This paper introduces a network structure into the information transmission process and examines its impact on optimization performance. The network structure is characterized by an asymmetric BA model with parameters for in-degree $r$ and asymmetry $\omega$. At $\omega=1$, the model describes a scale-free network; at $\omega=0$, a random network; and at $\omega=-1$, an extended lattice. We aim to solve the ground state search of the mean-field Ising model, employing a linear decision function for the ants with their response to pheromones quantified by the parameter $\alpha$. For $\omega&gt;-1$, the pheromone rates for options converge to stable fixed points of the stochastic system. Below the critical threshold $\alpha_c$, there is one stable fixed point, while above $\alpha_c$, there are two. Notably, as $\omega \to -1$, both the driving force toward stable fixed points and the strength of the noise reach their maximum, significantly enhancing the probability of finding the ground state of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>pyhgf: A neural network library for predictive coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pyhgf}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs. The code, tutorials and documentation are hosted at: https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning with Neuromorphic Computing: Theories, Methods, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To adapt to real-world dynamics, intelligent systems need to assimilate new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks leads to a degradation in performance on old tasks. To address this, continual learning concept is proposed for enabling autonomous systems to acquire new knowledge and dynamically adapt to changing environments. Specifically, energy-efficient continual learning is needed to ensure the functionality of autonomous systems under tight compute and memory resource budgets (i.e., so-called autonomous embedded systems). Neuromorphic computing, with brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers inherent advantages for enabling low-power/energy continual learning in autonomous embedded systems. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the foundations and methods for enabling continual learning in neural networks, then analyze the state-of-the-art works considering SNNs. Afterward, comparative analyses of existing methods are conducted while considering crucial design factors, such as network complexity, memory, latency, and power/energy efficiency. We also explore the practical applications that can benefit from SNN-based continual learning and open challenges in real-world scenarios. In this manner, our survey provides valuable insights into the recent advancements of SNN-based continual learning for real-world application use-cases.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient SNN Architecture using 3nm FinFET Multiport SRAM-based CIM with Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Artificial Intelligence (AI) computation systems face challenges, primarily from the memory-wall issue, limiting overall system-level performance, especially for Edge devices with constrained battery budgets, such as smartphones, wearables, and Internet-of-Things sensor systems. In this paper, we propose a new SRAM-based Compute-In-Memory (CIM) accelerator optimized for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) Inference. Our proposed architecture employs a multiport SRAM design with multiple decoupled Read ports to enhance the throughput and Transposable Read-Write ports to facilitate online learning. Furthermore, we develop an Arbiter circuit for efficient data-processing and port allocations during the computation. Results for a 128$\times$128 array in 3nm FinFET technology demonstrate a 3.1$\times$ improvement in speed and a 2.2$\times$ enhancement in energy efficiency with our proposed multiport SRAM design compared to the traditional single-port design. At system-level, a throughput of 44 MInf/s at 607 pJ/Inf and 29mW is achieved.</description>

      <title>Structure of Artificial Neural Networks -- Empirical Investigations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within one decade, Deep Learning overtook the dominating solution methods of countless problems of artificial intelligence. ``Deep'' refers to the deep architectures with operations in manifolds of which there are no immediate observations. For these deep architectures some kind of structure is pre-defined -- but what is this structure? With a formal definition for structures of neural networks, neural architecture search problems and solution methods can be formulated under a common framework. Both practical and theoretical questions arise from closing the gap between applied neural architecture search and learning theory. Does structure make a difference or can it be chosen arbitrarily?
  This work is concerned with deep structures of artificial neural networks and examines automatic construction methods under empirical principles to shed light on to the so called ``black-box models''.
  Our contributions include a formulation of graph-induced neural networks that is used to pose optimisation problems for neural architecture. We analyse structural properties for different neural network objectives such as correctness, robustness or energy consumption and discuss how structure affects them. Selected automation methods for neural architecture optimisation problems are discussed and empirically analysed. With the insights gained from formalising graph-induced neural networks, analysing structural properties and comparing the applicability of neural architecture search methods qualitatively and quantitatively we advance these methods in two ways. First, new predictive models are presented for replacing computationally expensive evaluation schemes, and second, new generative models for informed sampling during neural architecture search are analysed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Reducing Data Bottlenecks in Distributed, Heterogeneous Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of embedded multicore and many-core systems has revolutionized computing, enabling the development of high-performance, energy-efficient solutions for a wide range of applications. As models scale up in size, data movement is increasingly the bottleneck to performance. This movement of data can exist between processor and memory, or between cores and chips. This paper investigates the impact of bottleneck size, in terms of inter-chip data traffic, on the performance of deep learning models in embedded multicore and many-core systems. We conduct a systematic analysis of the relationship between bottleneck size, computational resource utilization, and model accuracy. We apply a hardware-software co-design methodology where data bottlenecks are replaced with extremely narrow layers to reduce the amount of data traffic. In effect, time-multiplexing of signals is replaced by learnable embeddings that reduce the demands on chip IOs. Our experiments on the CIFAR100 dataset demonstrate that the classification accuracy generally decreases as the bottleneck ratio increases, with shallower models experiencing a more significant drop compared to deeper models. Hardware-side evaluation reveals that higher bottleneck ratios lead to substantial reductions in data transfer volume across the layers of the neural network. Through this research, we can determine the trade-off between data transfer volume and model performance, enabling the identification of a balanced point that achieves good performance while minimizing data transfer volume. This characteristic allows for the development of efficient models that are well-suited for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>EG-SpikeFormer: Eye-Gaze Guided Transformer on Spiking Neural Networks for Medical Image Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial intelligence, predominantly utilizing spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Significant advancements have been made in SNN-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. However, their applications in the medical imaging domain remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce EG-SpikeFormer, an SNN architecture designed for clinical tasks that integrates eye-gaze data to guide the model's focus on diagnostically relevant regions in medical images. This approach effectively addresses shortcut learning issues commonly observed in conventional models, especially in scenarios with limited clinical data and high demands for model reliability, generalizability, and transparency. Our EG-SpikeFormer not only demonstrates superior energy efficiency and performance in medical image classification tasks but also enhances clinical relevance. By incorporating eye-gaze data, the model improves interpretability and generalization, opening new directions for the application of neuromorphic computing in healthcare.</description>

      <title>AutoTurb: Using Large Language Models for Automatic Algebraic Model Discovery of Turbulence Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) methods have been extensively investigated to explore explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models (EARSM) for turbulence closure of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The deduced EARSM can be readily implemented in existing computational fluid dynamic (CFD) codes and promotes the identification of physically interpretable turbulence models. The existing SR methods, such as genetic programming, sparse regression, or artificial neural networks, require user-defined functional operators, a library of candidates, or complex optimization algorithms. In this work, a novel framework using LLMs to automatically discover algebraic expressions for correcting the RSM is proposed. The direct observation of Reynolds stress and the indirect output of the CFD simulation are both involved in the training process to guarantee data consistency and avoid numerical stiffness. Constraints of functional complexity and convergence are supplementally imposed in the objective function on account of the tremendous flexibility of LLMs. The evolutionary search is employed for global optimization. The proposed method is performed for separated flow over periodic hills at Re = 10,595. The generalizability of the discovered model is verified on a set of 2D turbulent separated flow configurations with different Reynolds numbers and geometries. It is demonstrated that the corrective RANS can improve the prediction for both the Reynolds stress and mean velocity fields. Compared with algebraic models discovered by other works, the discovered model performs better in accuracy and generalization capability. The proposed approach provides a promising paradigm for using LLMs to improve turbulence modeling for a given class of flows.</description>

      <title>MT-SNN: Enhance Spiking Neural Network with Multiple Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) present a promising energy efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their multiplication-free operations enabled by binarized intermediate activations. However, this binarization leads to precision loss, hindering the SNN performance. In this paper, we introduce Multiple Threshold (MT) approaches to significantly enhance SNN accuracy by mitigating precision loss. We propose two distinct modes for MT implementation, depending on the membrane update rule: parallel mode and cascade mode. MT-SNN models can be efficiently trained on standard hardwares like GPUs and TPUs, while retaining the multiplication-free advantage crucial for deployment on neuromorphic devices. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet, and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that both MT modes substantially improve the performance of single-threshold SNNs, achieving higher accuracy with fewer time steps and comparable energy consumption. Moreover, MT-SNNs outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Notably, with MT, a Parametric-Leaky-Integrate-Fire (PLIF) based ResNet-34 architecture reaches 72.17\% accuracy on ImageNet with a single time step, surpassing the previous SOTA by 2.75\% despite using 4 steps.</description>

      <title>ReEvo: Large Language Models as Hyper-Heuristics with Reflective Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The omnipresence of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) compels domain experts to engage in trial-and-error heuristic design. The long-standing endeavor of design automation has gained new momentum with the rise of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs), an emerging variant of Hyper-Heuristics that leverages LLMs for heuristic generation, featuring minimal manual intervention and open-ended heuristic spaces. To empower LHHs, we present Reflective Evolution (ReEvo), a novel integration of evolutionary search for efficiently exploring the heuristic space, and LLM reflections to provide verbal gradients within the space. Across five heterogeneous algorithmic types, six different COPs, and both white-box and black-box views of COPs, ReEvo yields state-of-the-art and competitive meta-heuristics, evolutionary algorithms, heuristics, and neural solvers, while being more sample-efficient than prior LHHs.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Vision to Language: Enhancing Brain Recording-based Visual Reconstruction and Language Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding non-invasive brain recordings is pivotal for advancing our understanding of human cognition but faces challenges due to individual differences and complex neural signal representations. Traditional methods often require customized models and extensive trials, lacking interpretability in visual reconstruction tasks. Our framework integrates 3D brain structures with visual semantics using a Vision Transformer 3D. This unified feature extractor efficiently aligns fMRI features with multiple levels of visual embeddings, eliminating the need for subject-specific models and allowing extraction from single-trial data. The extractor consolidates multi-level visual features into one network, simplifying integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we have enhanced the fMRI dataset with diverse fMRI-image-related textual data to support multimodal large model development. Integrating with LLMs enhances decoding capabilities, enabling tasks such as brain captioning, complex reasoning, concept localization, and visual reconstruction. Our approach demonstrates superior performance across these tasks, precisely identifying language-based concepts within brain signals, enhancing interpretability, and providing deeper insights into neural processes. These advances significantly broaden the applicability of non-invasive brain decoding in neuroscience and human-computer interaction, setting the stage for advanced brain-computer interfaces and cognitive models.</description>

      <title>Future Trends in the Design of Memetic Algorithms: the Case of the Linear Ordering Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The way heuristic optimizers are designed has evolved over the decades, as computing power has increased. Such has been the case for the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP), a field in which trajectory-based strategies led the way during the 1990s, but which have now been surpassed by memetic schemes.This paper focuses on understanding how the design of LOP optimizers will change in the future, as computing power continues to increase, yielding two main contributions.On the one hand, a metaheuristic was designed that is capable of effectively exploiting a large amount of computational resources, specifically, computing power equivalent to what a recent core can output during runs lasting over four months.Our analyses show that as the power of the computational resources increases, it will be necessary to boost the capacities of the intensification methods applied in the memetic algorithms to keep the population from stagnating.And on the other, the best-known results for today's most challenging set of instances (xLOLIB2) were significantly outperformed. New bounds were established in this benchmark, which provides a new frame of reference for future research.</description>

Abstract: The present study covers an approach to neural architecture search (NAS) using Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) for the design and optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In designing artificial neural networks, one crucial aspect of the innovative approach is suggesting a novel neural architecture. Currently used architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. In this work, we use pure Genetic Programming Approach to design CNNs, which employs only one genetic operation, i.e., mutation. In the course of preliminary experiments, our methodology yields promising results.</description>

The primary motivation is to make B-NTGA more efficient in exploring Pareto Front Approximation (PFa), focusing on 'gaps' and reducing some PFa regions' sampling too frequently. Such a balancing mechanism allows B-NTGA to be more adaptive and focus on less explored PFa regions. The proposed B-NTGA is investigated on two benchmark multi- and many-objective optimization real-world problems, like Thief Traveling Problem and Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. The results of experiments show that B-NTGA has a higher efficiency and better performance than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MoEUT: Mixture-of-Experts Universal Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16039</link>

Abstract: Previous work on Universal Transformers (UTs) has demonstrated the importance of parameter sharing across layers. By allowing recurrence in depth, UTs have advantages over standard Transformers in learning compositional generalizations, but layer-sharing comes with a practical limitation of parameter-compute ratio: it drastically reduces the parameter count compared to the non-shared model with the same dimensionality. Naively scaling up the layer size to compensate for the loss of parameters makes its computational resource requirements prohibitive. In practice, no previous work has succeeded in proposing a shared-layer Transformer design that is competitive in parameter count-dominated tasks such as language modeling. Here we propose MoEUT (pronounced "moot"), an effective mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based shared-layer Transformer architecture, which combines several recent advances in MoEs for both feedforward and attention layers of standard Transformers together with novel layer-normalization and grouping schemes that are specific and crucial to UTs. The resulting UT model, for the first time, slightly outperforms standard Transformers on language modeling tasks such as BLiMP and PIQA, while using significantly less compute and memory.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the benefits of efficient creation and adaption of behavior models in intelligent Digital Twins over the machine life cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the Digital Twin, which in the context of this paper is the virtual representation of a production system or its components, can be used as a "digital playground" to master the increasing complexity of these assets. One of the central subcomponents of the Digital Twin are behavior models that can enable benefits over the entire machine life cycle. However, the creation, adaption and use of behavior models throughout the machine life cycle is very time-consuming, which is why approaches to improve the cost-benefit ratio are needed. Furthermore, there is a lack of specific use cases that illustrate the application and added benefit of behavior models over the machine life cycle, which is why the universal application of behavior models in industry is still lacking compared to research. This paper first presents the fundamentals, challenges and related work on Digital Twins and behavior models in the context of the machine life cycle. Then, concepts for low-effort creation and automatic adaption of Digital Twins are presented, with a focus on behavior models. Finally, the aforementioned gap between research and industry is addressed by demonstrating various realized use cases over the machine life cycle, in which the advantages as well as the application of behavior models in the different life cycle phases are shown.</description>

      <title>New Metrics for Assessing Projection Pursuit Indexes, and Guiding Optimisation Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projection pursuit (PP) guided tour interactively optimises a criterion function known as the PP index, to explore high-dimensional data by revealing interesting projections. Optimisation of some PP indexes can be non-trivial, if they are non-smooth functions, or the optimum has a small "squint angle", detectable only from close proximity. To address these challenges, this study investigates the performance of a recently introduced swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search Optimiser (JSO), for optimising PP indexes. The performance of JSO for visualising data is evaluated across various hyper-parameter settings and compared with existing optimisers. Additionally, methods for calculating the smoothness and squintability properties of the PP index are proposed. They are used to assess the optimiser performance in the presence of PP index complexities. A simulation study illustrates the use of these performance metrics to compare the JSO with existing optimisation methods available for the guided tour. The JSO algorithm has been implemented in the R package, `tourr`, and functions to calculate smoothness and squintability are available in the `ferrn` package.</description>

      <title>Understanding Deep Learning via Notions of Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the extreme popularity of deep learning in science and industry, its formal understanding is limited. This thesis puts forth notions of rank as key for developing a theory of deep learning, focusing on the fundamental aspects of generalization and expressiveness. In particular, we establish that gradient-based training can induce an implicit regularization towards low rank for several neural network architectures, and demonstrate empirically that this phenomenon may facilitate an explanation of generalization over natural data (e.g., audio, images, and text). Then, we characterize the ability of graph neural networks to model interactions via a notion of rank, which is commonly used for quantifying entanglement in quantum physics. A central tool underlying these results is a connection between neural networks and tensor factorizations. Practical implications of our theory for designing explicit regularization schemes and data preprocessing algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Quantum Computing and Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A Novel Computing Paradigm Shift in Privacy-Preserving ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</description>
