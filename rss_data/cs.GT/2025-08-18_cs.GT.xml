      <title>Can We Tell if ChatGPT is a Parasite? Studying Human-AI Symbiosis with Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work asks whether a human interacting with a generative AI system can merge into a single individual through iterative, information-driven interactions. We model the interactions between a human, a generative AI system, and the human's wider environment as a three-player stochastic game. We use information-theoretic measures (entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy) to show that our modelled human and generative AI are able to form an aggregate individual in the sense of Krakauer et al. (2020). The model we present is able to answer interesting questions around the symbiotic nature of humans and AI systems, including whether LLM-driven chatbots are acting as parasites, feeding on the information provided by humans.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Aware Learning in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of uncoupled online learning in multiplayer games has made significant progress in recent years. In particular, the development of time-varying games has considerably expanded its modeling capabilities. However, current regret bounds quickly become vacuous when the game undergoes significant variations over time, even when these variations are easy to predict. Intuitively, the ability of players to forecast future payoffs should lead to tighter guarantees, yet existing approaches fail to incorporate this aspect. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing a novel prediction-aware framework for time-varying games, where agents can forecast future payoffs and adapt their strategies accordingly. In this framework, payoffs depend on an underlying state of nature that agents predict in an online manner. To leverage these predictions, we propose the POWMU algorithm, a contextual extension of the optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update algorithm, for which we establish theoretical guarantees on social welfare and convergence to equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that, under bounded prediction errors, the proposed framework achieves performance comparable to the static setting. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of POWMU in a traffic routing experiment.</description>

      <title>Spatial Branch-and-Bound for Computing Multiplayer Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models. However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Matching Framework for Faster Child Adoptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Caseworkers in foster care systems match waiting children to adoptive homes. We use dynamic matching market design to characterize a class of mechanisms that incentivize expedient matches that homes can accept or decline. We design mechanisms satisfying fairness and limited strategy-proofness. They also avoid costly patience. Our empirically-based simulations suggest the mechanisms could increase adoptions by at least 25% versus the status quo. A naive dynamic extension of Deferred Acceptance does not attain these benefits. Our mechanisms sidestep direct preference elicitation by predicting preferences, and they are robust to prediction error.</description>

      <title>Smooth Games of Configuration in the Linear-Quadratic Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However, the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ, differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage) trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.</description>
