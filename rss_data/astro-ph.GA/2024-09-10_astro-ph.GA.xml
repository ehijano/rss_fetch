      <title>A Deeper Look into eFEDS AGN Candidates in Dwarf Galaxies with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to accurately discern active massive black holes (BHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies is paramount to understanding the origins and processes of "seed" BHs in the early Universe. We present Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of a sample of three local dwarf galaxies (M$_{*}$ $\leqslant 3 \times 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$, z $\leqslant$ 0.15) previously identified as candidates for hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). The galaxies were selected from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) with spatially coincident X-ray detections in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). Our new Chandra data reveal three X-ray point sources in two of the target galaxies with luminosities between log(L$_{\rm \text{2-10 keV}}$ [erg s$^{-1}$]) = 39.1 and 40.4. Our results support the presence of an AGN in these two galaxies and a ULX in one of them. For the AGNs, we estimate BH masses of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5-6} M_\odot$ and Eddington ratios on the order of $\sim 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>The formation and disruption of globular cluster populations in simulations of present-day $L^\ast$ galaxies with controlled assembly histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are sensitive tracers of galaxy assembly histories but interpreting the information they encode is challenging because mergers are thought to promote both the formation and disruption of GCs. We use simulations with controlled merger histories to examine the influence of merger mass ratio on the GC population of a present-day $L^\ast$ galaxy, using the genetic modification technique to adjust the initial conditions of a galaxy that experiences major mergers at $z = 1.7$ and $z = 0.77$ (ORGANIC case), so the later merger has twice its original mass ratio (ENHANCED case), or is prevented from occurring (SUPPRESSED case). We evolve the three realizations with E-MOSAICS, which couples sub-grid star cluster formation and evolution models to the EAGLE galaxy formation model. Relative to the ORGANIC case, the mass of surviving GCs is elevated (reduced) in the ENHANCED (SUPPRESSED) case, indicating that major mergers promote a net boost to the GC population. The boost is clearly quantified by the GC specific mass, $S_{\rm M}$, because it is sensitive to the number of the most massive GCs, whose long characteristic disruption timescales enable them to survive their hostile natal environments. In contrast, the specific frequency, $T_{\rm N}$, is insensitive to assembly history because it primarily traces low-mass GCs that tend to be disrupted soon after their formation. The promotion of GC formation and disruption by major mergers imprints a lasting and potentially observable signature: an elevated mass fraction of field stars in the galaxy's stellar halo that were born in star clusters.</description>

      <title>The Rapid Formation of the Metal Poor Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the assembly timeline of the Milky Way has been transforming along with the dramatic increase in astrometric and spectroscopic data available over the past several years. Many substructures in chemo-dynamical space have been discovered and identified as the remnants of various galactic mergers. To investigate the timeline of these mergers we select main sequence turn off &amp; subgiant stars (MSTOs) from the H3 survey, finding members in seven metal poor components of the halo: GSE, the Helmi Streams, Thamnos, Sequoia, Wukong/LMS-1, Arjuna, and I'itoi. We also select out the metal poor in situ disk to facilitate comparison to the evolution of the Milky Way itself at these early epochs. We fit individual isochrone ages to the MSTOs in each of these substructures and use the resulting age distributions to infer simple star formation histories. For GSE we resolve an extended star formation history that truncates $\approx10$ Gyr ago, as well as a clear age -- metallicity relation. From this age distribution and measured star formation history we infer that GSE merged with the Milky Way at a time $9.5-10.2$ Gyr ago, in agreement with previous estimates. We infer that the other mergers occurred at various times ranging from $9-13$ Gyr ago, and that the metal poor component of the disk built up within only a few billion years. These results reinforce the emerging picture that both the disk and halo of the Milky Way experienced a rapid assembly.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Distribution of Lyman-$\alpha$ Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission and escape of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from star-forming galaxies is determined through complex interactions between the emitted photons and a galaxy's interstellar and circumgalactic gas, causing Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) to commonly appear not as point sources but in spatially extended halos with complex spectral profiles. We develop a 3D spatial-spectral model of Lyman-$\alpha$ halos (LAHs) to replicate LAH observations in integral field spectroscopic studies, such as those made with VLT/MUSE. The profile of this model is a function of 6 key halo properties: the halo- and compact-source exponential scale lengths ($r_{sH}$ and $r_{sC}$), the halo flux fraction ($f_H$), the compact component ellipticity ($q$), the spectral line width ($\sigma$), and the spectral line skewness parameter ($\gamma$). Placing a series of model LAHs into datacubes reflecting observing conditions in the MUSE UDF-Mosaic survey, we test their detection recoverability and determine that $\sigma$, $r_{sH}$, and $f_H$ are expected to have the most significant effect on the detectability of the overall LAH at a given central wavelength and intrinsic line luminosity. We develop a general selection function model spanning a grid of these halo parameters, and with a sample of 145 UDF-Mosaic LAHs with measured halo properties, we derive completeness-corrected, intrinsic distributions of the values of $\sigma$, $r_{sH}$, and $f_H$ for $3&lt;z&lt;5$ LAHs. We present best-fit functional forms of the distributions, and a $\sigma$ distribution corrected for instrumental line-spread function (LSF) broadening, and thereby show the physical line spread distribution of the intrinsic population. Finally, we discuss implications of these distributions for Ly$\alpha$ emission through the circumgalactic medium, finding that observations undercount LAHs with extended halo scale lengths compared to the intrinsic population.</description>

      <title>cogsworth: A Gala of COSMIC proportions combining binary stellar evolution and galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cogsworth, an open-source Python tool for producing self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations. With cogsworth one can (1) sample a population of binaries and star formation history, (2) perform rapid (binary) stellar evolution, (3) integrate orbits through the galaxy and (4) inspect the full evolutionary history of each star or compact object, as well as their positions and kinematics. We include the functionality for post-processing hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations as a basis for galactic potentials and star formation histories to better account for initial spatial stellar clustering and more complex potentials. Alternatively, several analytic models are available for both the potential and star formation history. cogsworth can transform the intrinsic simulated population to an observed population through the joint application of dust maps, bolometric correction functions and survey selection functions.
  We provide a detailed explanation of the functionality of cogsworth and demonstrate its capabilities through a series of use cases: (1) We predict the spatial distribution of compact objects and runaways in both dwarf and Milky-Way-like galaxies, (2) using a star cluster from a hydrodynamical simulation, we show how supernovae can change the orbits of stars in several ways, and (3) we predict the separation of disrupted binary stellar companions on the sky and create a synthetic Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. We also discuss some current limitations and plans for future developments. We designed cogsworth and its online documentation to provide a powerful tool for constraining binary evolution, but also a flexible and accessible resource for the entire community.</description>

      <title>First direct carbon abundance measured at $z&gt;10$ in the lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the metal enrichment in the early universe helps us constrain theories about the first stars and study the ages of galaxies. The lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD at $z=10.17$ is the brightest galaxy known at $z &gt; 10$. Previous work analyzing JWST NIRSpec and MIRI data yielded a direct metallicity $\rm{12+log(O/H)}=7.79\pm0.09$ ($\sim$ 0.13 $Z_\odot$) and electron density $\rm{log}(n_e / \rm{cm^{-3}}) = 2.9 \pm 0.5$, the most distant such measurements to date. Here we estimate the direct C/O abundance for the first time at $z &gt; 10$, finding a sub-solar ${\rm log(C/O)}=-0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. This is higher than other $z&gt;6$ galaxies with direct C/O measurements, likely due to higher metallicity. It is also slightly higher than galaxies in the local universe with similar metallicity. This may suggest a very efficient and rapid burst of star formation, a low effective oxygen abundance yield, or the presence of unusual stellar populations including supermassive stars. Alternatively, the strong CIII]${\rm {\lambda}{\lambda}}$1907,1909 emission ($14\pm 3\,{\r{A}}$ rest-frame EW) may originate from just one of the two component star clusters JDB ($r \sim 20$ pc). Future NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations of MACS0647$-$JD will be promising for disentangling C/O in the two components to constrain the chemistry of individual star clusters just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Position displacement of diffuse interstellar bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-consider the already published phenomenon: the blue shift of diffuse interstellar bands, observed in spectra of HD34078 (AE Aur) and members of the Sco OB1 association, in particular HD152233. We have analyzed 29 diffuse bands. Part of them, already proven as blue-shifted in our earlier study, are now confirmed using another instrument: this time the 6.5m Clay telescope equipped with the MIKE spectrograph. The high signal-to-noise ratio (over 600) of our spectra allowed us to reveal even small small scale {\bf displacements} of positions (both: blue and red-shifts) of diffuse bands along the considered lines of sight. In some cases the magnitude of deviation exceeds 10 km\,s$^{-1}$. Also, we prove that profiles of many diffuse bands in spectra of HD34078 suffer significant broadening. The origin of the observed phenomena is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Camera Magellanic Clouds Emission-Line Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the CTIO Blanco 4-m telescope to perform a new emission-line survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using narrow-band H-alpha and [SII] filters in addition to a continuum band for use in creating pure emission-line images. We refer to this new survey as DeMCELS, to distinguish it from the earlier Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) that has been in service for nearly 25 years. DeMCELS covers $\sim 54$ degrees$^{2}$, encompassing most of the bright optical disk of the LMC. With DECam's pixel size of only 0.27", our DeMCELS survey provides a seeing-limited improvement of 3-5 times over MCELS and is comparable in depth, with surface brightness limits of 3.3E-17 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ in H-alpha and 2.9E-17 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ in H-alpha and [SII], respectively. DeMCELS provides detailed morphological information on nebulae of all scales, from the largest supershells to individual [HII] regions and supernova remnants, to bubbles of emission surrounding individual stars, and even to faint structures in the diffuse ionized gas of the LMC. Many complex regions of emission show significant variations in the ratio of [SII] to H-alpha, a sign of the mixture of shocks from stellar winds and/or supernovae with photoionization by embedded hot, young stars. We present the details of the observing strategy and data processing for this survey, and show selected results in comparison with previous data. A companion project for the Small Magellanic Cloud is in progress and will be reported separately. We are making these new data available to the community at large via the NOIRLab's Data Lab site.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects as a key factor in shaping star-forming S0 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of lenticular galaxies (S0s) can be classified into two main categories: ``minor mergers" in low-density environments (LDEs) and ``faded spirals" in high-density environments (HDEs). The transitional phase in the evolution of S0s, namely, star-forming lenticular galaxies (SFS0s), can serve as an important probe for analyzing the complex processes involved in the transformation between different galaxy types and the quenching of star formation (SF). We attempt to find the impact of different environments on the global properties and spatially resolved quantities of SFS0s. We selected 71 SFS0s from the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey, comprising 23 SFS0s in HDEs (SFS0s$\_$HE) and 48 SFS0s in LDEs (SFS0s$\_$LE). We examined the effects of the environment, by studying the global properties, concentration index, and radial profiles of the derived quantities. The varied environments of SFS0s do not lead to any significant difference in global properties (e.g., S$\acute{\rm e}$rsic index). By calculating $CI_{\rm H_{\alpha}/cont}$, we observe that different environments may cause varying concentrations of SF. Specifically, SFS0s$\_$LE, affected by external gas mergers or inflow, exhibit a more centrally concentrated SF (i.e., larger $CI_{\rm H_{\alpha}/cont}$). This trend is further supported by $CI_{\rm SFR, H_{\alpha}}$, which only considers the gas disk of the galaxy. This observation is aligned with the observed shrinking of gas disks in galaxies affected by ram-pressure stripping in HDEs. Furthermore, their $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ or resolved sSFR are comparable. On average, SFS0s$\_$LE display significantly higher values for both quantities. Finally, the observed D$_{\rm n}4000$ and gas-phase metallicity gradient correspond well to their assumed origins. However, we did not find a significantly lower gas-phase metallicity in SFS0s$\_$LE. Abridged</description>

      <title>The circular velocity and halo mass functions of galaxies in the nearby Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular velocity function (CVF) of galaxies is a fundamental test of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm as it traces the variation of galaxy number densities with circular velocity ($v_{\rm{circ}}$), a proxy for dynamical mass. Previous observational studies of the CVF have either been based on \ion{H}{I}-rich galaxies, or encompassed low-number statistics and probed narrow ranges in $v_{\rm{circ}}$. We present a benchmark computation of the CVF between $100-350\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ using a sample of 3527 nearby-Universe galaxies, representative for stellar masses between $10^{9.2}-10^{11.9} \rm{M_{\odot}}$. We find significantly larger number densities above 150 $\rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ compared to results from \ion{H}{I} surveys, pertaining to the morphological diversity of our sample. Leveraging the fact that circular velocities are tracing the gravitational potential of halos, we compute the halo mass function (HMF), covering $\sim$1 dex of previously unprobed halo masses ($10^{11.7}-10^{12.7} \rm{M_{\odot}}$). The HMF for our sample, representative of the galaxy population with $M_{200}\geqslant10^{11.35} \rm{M_{\odot}}$, shows that spiral morphologies contribute 67 per cent of the matter density in the nearby Universe, while early types account for the rest. We combine our HMF data with literature measurements based on \ion{H}{I} kinematics and group/cluster velocity dispersions. We constrain the functional form of the HMF between $10^{10.5}-10^{15.5} \rm{M_{\odot}}$, finding a good agreement with $\Lambda$CDM predictions. The halo mass range probed encompasses 72$\substack{+5 \\ -6}$ per cent ($\Omega_{\rm{M,10.5-15.5}} = 0.227 \pm 0.018$) of the matter density in the nearby Universe; 31$\substack{+5 \\ -6}$ per cent is accounted for by halos below $10^{12.7}\rm{M_{\odot}}$ occupied by a single galaxy.</description>

      <title>Stellar reddening map from DESI imaging and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Galactic reddening maps of the high Galactic latitude sky using DESI imaging and spectroscopy. We directly measure the reddening of 2.6 million stars by comparing the observed stellar colors in $g-r$ and $r-z$ from DESI imaging with the synthetic colors derived from DESI spectra from the first two years of the survey. The reddening in the two colors is on average consistent with the \cite{fitzpatrick_correcting_1999} extinction curve with $R_\mathrm{V}=3.1$. We find that our reddening maps differ significantly from the commonly used \cite{schlegel_maps_1998} (SFD) reddening map (by up to 80 mmag in $E(B-V)$), and we attribute most of this difference to systematic errors in the SFD map. To validate the reddening map, we select a galaxy sample with extinction correction based on our reddening map, and this yields significantly better uniformity than the SFD extinction correction. Finally, we discuss the potential systematic errors in the DESI reddening measurements, including the photometric calibration errors that are the limiting factor on our accuracy. The $E(g-r)$ and $E(g-r)$ maps presented in this work, and for convenience their corresponding $E(B-V)$ maps with SFD calibration, are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Abundant Molecular Gas in the Central Region of Lenticular Galaxy PGC 39535</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lenticular galaxies (S0s) in the local universe are generally absent of recent star formation and lack molecular gas. In this paper, we investigate one massive ($M_*$$\sim$5$\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) star-forming S0, PGC 39535, with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Using optical data from SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, we find star formation mainly concentrates in the central region of PGC 39535. The total star formation rate estimated using extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ flux is 1.57 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Results of NOEMA observation suggest that the molecular gas mainly concentrates in the central regions as a gaseous bar and a ring-like structure, and shows similar kinematics as the stellar and ionized gas components. The total molecular gas mass estimated from CO(1-0) is (5.42$\pm$1.52)$\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find PGC 39535 lies on the star-forming main sequence, but falls below Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of spiral galaxies, suggesting that the star formation efficiency may be suppressed by the massive bulge. The existence of a second Gaussian component in the CO spectrum of the central region indicates possible gas flows. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that PGC 39535 resides in the center of a massive group and the derived star formation history indicates it may experience a series of gas-rich mergers over the past 2$\sim$7 Gyr.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Radiation and Supernovae Feedback on LyC Escape in Local Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback is widely recognized as an essential condition for Lyman continuum (LyC) escape in star-forming galaxies. However, the mechanisms by which galactic outflows clear neutral gas and dust remain unclear. In this paper, we model the Mg II 2796\r{A}, 2804\r{A} absorption + emission lines in 29 galaxies taken from the Low-z LyC Survey (LzLCS) to investigate the impact of (radiation + mechanical) feedback on LyC escape. Using constraints on Mg$^+$ and photoionization models, we map the outflows' neutral hydrogen content and predict $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ with a multiphase wind model. We measure mass, momentum, and energy loading factors for the neutral winds, which carry up to 10% of the momentum and 1% of the energy in SFR-based deposition rates. We use SED template fitting to determine the relative ages of stellar populations, allowing us to identify radiation feedback dominant systems. We then examine feedback related properties (stellar age, loading factors, etc.) under conditions that optimize feedback efficiency, specifically high star formation rate surface density and compact UV half-light radii. Our findings indicate that the strongest leakers are radiation feedback dominant, lack Mg II outflows, but have extended broad components in higher ionization lines like [O III] 5007\r{A}, as observed by Amor\'in et al. (2024). In contrast, galaxies experiencing supernovae feedback typically exhibit weaker $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ and show evidence of outflows in both Mg II and higher ionization lines. We attribute these findings to rapid or "catastrophic" cooling in the radiation-dominant systems, which, given the low metallicities in our sample, are likely experiencing delayed supernovae.</description>

      <title>Two Channels of Metal-Rich Compact Stellar System Formation: Starbursts Under High Ram Pressure vs. Tidal Stripping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most galaxies follow well-defined scaling relations of metallicity and stellar mass; however, some outliers at the low mass end of the observed galaxy population exhibit unusually high metallicity for their mass. Understanding how these objects get to be so metal-rich is vital for understanding the role of feedback in galaxy formation. Using the TNG50 simulation, we explore the origins of this phenomenon. We identify 227 metal-rich, Compact Stellar Systems (CSSs) that deviate significantly from this scaling relation. These CSSs are satellites located in the vicinity of massive host galaxies, with stellar masses ranging from $10^{8} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ (including six systems that are close analogs of the M31-M32 system). Contrary to the previously assumed scenario that such objects are predominantly products of tidal stripping, our results suggest a more prevalent role for ram pressure in their formation. Indeed, 76\% (173) of these CSSs are formed through a burst of star formation occurring around the time of the first pericentric passage, typically at redshifts $z\lesssim1$, aided by strong ram pressure and tidal forces. The high ram pressure, resulting from the CSSs' rapid motion near the halo center, facilitates metal enrichment, producing high-metallicity CSSs by confining the metal-rich gas from bursty star formation, which leads to distinct stellar populations characterized by enhanced metallicity as well as high $\alpha$-abundance. Only the remaining 24\% (54) of metal-rich CSSs are generated through the tidal stripping of massive progenitors. Our results further indicate that M32 is more likely to have formed through intense star formation events rather than through gradual, tidal stripping, thereby providing crucial insights into the nature of low mass, compact galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying azimuthal variations within the interstellar medium of z ~ 0 spiral galaxies with the TYPHOON survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most star formation in the local Universe occurs in spiral galaxies, but their origin remains an unanswered question. Various theories have been proposed to explain the development of spiral arms, each predicting different spatial distributions of the interstellar medium. This study maps the star formation rate (SFR) and gas-phase metallicity of nine spiral galaxies with the TYPHOON survey to test two dominating theories: density wave theory and dynamic spiral theory. We discuss the environmental effects on our galaxies, considering reported environments and merging events. Taking advantage of the large field of view covering the entire optical disk, we quantify the fluctuation of SFR and metallicity relative to the azimuthal distance from the spiral arms. We find higher SFR and metallicity in the trailing edge of NGC~1365 (by 0.117~dex and 0.068~dex, respectively) and NGC~1566 (by 0.119~dex and 0.037~dex, respectively), which is in line with density wave theory. NGC~2442 shows a different result with higher metallicity (0.093~dex) in the leading edge, possibly attributed to an ongoing merging. The other six spiral galaxies show no statistically significant offset in SFR or metallicity, consistent with dynamic spiral theory. We also compare the behaviour of metallicity inside and outside the co-rotation radius (CR) of NGC~1365 and NGC~1566. We find comparable metallicity fluctuations near and beyond the CR of NGC~1365, indicating gravitational perturbation. NGC~1566 shows the greatest fluctuation near the CR, in line with the analytic spiral arms. Our work highlights that a combination of mechanisms explains the origin of spiral features in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>JCMT 850 $\micron$ continuum observations of density structures in the G35 molecular complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments are believed to play a key role in high-mass star formation. We present a systematic study of the filaments and their hosting clumps in the G35 molecular complex using JCMT SCUBA-2 850 $\micron$ continuum data. We identified five clouds in the complex and 91 filaments within them, some of which form 10 hub-filament systems (HFSs), each with at least 3 hub-composing filaments. We also compiled a catalogue of 350 dense clumps, 183 of which are associated with the filaments. We investigated the physical properties of the filaments and clumps, such as mass, density, and size, and their relation to star formation. We find that the global mass-length trend of the filaments is consistent with a turbulent origin, while the hub-composing filaments of high line masses ($m_{\rm l}\,&gt;$\,230\,$\mathrm{M_{\odot}~pc^{-1}}$) in HFSs deviate from this relation, possibly due to feedback from massive star formation. We also find that the most massive and densest clumps (R\,$&gt;$\,0.2\,pc, M\,$&gt;35\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, $\mathrm{\Sigma}&gt;\,0.05\,\mathrm{g~cm^{-2}}$) are located in the filaments and in the hubs of HFS with the latter bearing a higher probability of occurrence of high-mass star-forming signatures, highlighting the preferential sites of HFSs for high-mass star formation. We do not find significant variation in the clump mass surface density across different evolutionary environments of the clouds, which may reflect the balance between mass accretion and stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>The halo mass dependence of physical and observable properties in the circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dependence of the physical and observable properties of the CGM on its halo mass. We analyse 22 simulations from the Auriga suite of high resolution cosmological `zoom-in' simulations at $z=0$ with halo masses $10^{10}~\text{M}_{\odot}\leq\text{M}_{\mathrm{200c}}\leq10^{12}~\text{M}_{\odot}$. We find a larger scatter in temperature and smaller scatter in metallicity in more massive haloes. The scatter of temperature and metallicity as a function of radius increases out to larger radii. The median and scatter of the volume-weighted density and mass-weighted radial velocity show no significant dependence on halo mass. Our results highlight that the CGM is more multiphase in haloes of higher mass. We additionally investigate column densities for HI and the metal ions CIV, OVI, MgII and SiII as a function of stellar mass and radius. We find the HI and metal ion column densities increase with stellar mass at sufficiently large radii ($R\gtrsim{0.2}$R$_{\mathrm{200c}}$). We find good agreement between our HI column densities and observations outside $20$% of the virial radius and overpredict within $20$%. MgII and SiII are similarly overpredicted within $20$% of the virial radius, but drop off steeply at larger radii. Our OVI column densities underpredict observations for stellar masses between $10^{9.7}~\text{M}_{\odot}\leq\text{M}_{\star}&lt;10^{10.8}~\text{M}_{\odot}$ with reasonable agreement at $10^{10.8}~\text{M}_{\odot}$. CIV column densities agree with observational detections above a halo mass of $10^{9.7}~\text{M}_{\odot}$. We find that OVI (MgII) traces the highest (lowest) temperatures, and lowest (highest) density and metallicity. OVI and CIV are photo-ionized (collisionally ionized) at low (high) halo masses with a transition to higher temperatures at $10^{11}~\text{M}_{\odot}$. However, there is no clear trend for the radial velocity of the ions.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). V: Unveiling PAH survival and resilience in the circumnuclear regions of AGN with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared PAH bands in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of local AGN from the GATOS Survey. In this work, we examine the PAH properties in the circumnuclear regions of AGN and AGN-outflows, and compare them to those in star-forming regions and the innermost regions of AGN. This study employs 4.9-28.1 micron sub-arcsecond angular resolution data to investigate the properties of PAH in three nearby sources (DL~30-40 Mpc). Our findings align with previous JWST studies, showing that the central regions of AGN show a larger fraction of neutral PAH molecules (i.e. elevated 11.3/6.2 and 11.3/7.7 PAH ratios) compared to star-forming galaxies. We find that the AGN might affect not only the PAH population in the innermost region but also in the extended regions up to ~kpc scales. By comparing our observations to PAH diagnostic diagrams, we find that, in general, regions located in the projected direction of the AGN-outflow occupy similar positions on the PAH diagnostic diagrams as those of the innermost regions of AGN. Star-forming regions that are not affected by the AGN in these galaxies share the same part of the diagram as Star-forming galaxies. We examine the potential of the PAH-H2 diagram to disentangle AGN versus star-forming activity. Our results suggest that in Sy-like AGN, illumination and feedback from the AGN might affect the PAH population at nuclear and kpc scales, in particular, the ionization state of the PAH grains. However, PAH sizes are rather similar. The carriers of the ionized PAH bands (6.2 and 7.7 micron) are less resilience than those of neutral PAH bands (11.3 micron), which might be particularly important for strongly AGN-host coupled systems. Therefore, caution must be applied when using PAH bands as star-formation rate indicators in these systems even at kpc scales, with the ionized ones being more affected by the AGN.</description>

      <title>The tight correlation of PAH and CO emission from z~0-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aim: The cold molecular gas mass is one of the crucial, yet challenging parameters in galaxy evolution studies. Here, we introduce a new calibration for estimating molecular gas masses using mid-infrared (MIR) photometry. This topic is timely, as JWST now allows us to detect the MIR emission of typical main-sequence galaxies across a wide range of masses and star formation rates with modest time investments. This Letter highlights the strong synergy between ALMA and JWST for studies of dust and gas at cosmic noon. Methods: We combine a sample of 14 main sequence galaxies at z=1-3 with robust CO detections and multi-band MIR photometry, along with a literature sample at z=0-4 with CO and PAH spectroscopy, to study the relationship between PAH, CO(1-0), and total IR luminosities. PAH luminosities are derived from modeling rest-frame UV to sub-mm data. The new z=1-3 sample extends previous high-z studies to about an order-of-magnitude lower PAH and CO luminosities, into the regime of local starbursts for the first time. Results: The PAH-to-CO luminosity ratio remains constant across a wide range of luminosities, for various galaxy types, and throughout the explored redshift range. In contrast, the PAH-to-IR and CO-to-IR luminosity ratios deviate from a constant value at high L(IR). The intrinsic scatter in the L(PAH)-L'(CO) relation is 0.21 dex, with a median of 1.40, and a power-law slope of $1.07 \pm 0.04$. Both the PAH-IR and CO-IR relations are sub-linear. Given the tight and uniform PAH-CO relation over ~3 orders of magnitude, we provide a recipe to estimate the cold molecular gas mass of galaxies from PAH luminosities, with a PAH-to-molecular gas conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm PAH7.7} = (3.08 \pm 1.08)(4.3/\alpha_{\rm CO})\,M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$. This method opens a new window to explore the gas content of galaxies beyond the local Universe using multi-wavelength JWST/MIRI imaging.</description>

      <title>The impact of feedback on the evolution of gas density profiles from galaxies to clusters: a universal fitting formula from the Simba suite of simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radial distribution of gas within galactic haloes is connected to the star formation rate and the nature of baryon-driven feedback processes. Using six variants of the hydrodynamic simulation Simba, we study the impact of different stellar/AGN feedback prescriptions on the gas density profiles of haloes in the total mass range $10^{11} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\mathrm{200c}} &lt; 10^{14} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. We find that the radial profiles are well represented by a power law and that, for a fixed total halo mass, the slope and amplitude of such power law are generally weakly dependent on redshift. Once AGN-driven jets are activated in the simulation, the gas density profile of haloes with $M_{\rm 200c} \gtrsim 10^{13} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ declines more gently with radial distance. We argue that this distinctive feature could be exploited with current observations to discriminate amongst the predictions of the different feedback models. We introduce a universal fitting formula for the slope and amplitude of the gas density profile as a function of total halo mass and redshift. The best-fit functions are suitable for all feedback variants considered, and their predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical results. We provide the values of all fit parameters, making our fitting formula a versatile tool to mimic the effect of Simba feedback models onto N-body simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. Our results can also aid observational estimates of the gas mass within haloes that assume a specific slope for the underlying gas density profile.</description>

      <title>BROWDIE: a New Machine Learning Model for Searching T&amp;Y Dwarfs Using the UKIDSS J, H, K Band Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new T, Y dwarf search model using machine learning (ML), called the "BROWn Dwarf Image Explorer (BROWDIE). Brown dwarfs (BD) are estimated to make up 25 percent of all celestial objects in the Galaxy, yet only a small number have been thoroughly studied. Homogeneous and complete samples of BDs are essential to advance the studies. However, due to their faintness, conducting spectral studies of BDs can be challenging. T\&amp;Y brown dwarfs, a redder and fainter subclass of BDs, are even harder to detect. As a result, only a few T\&amp;Y dwarfs have been extensively studied. Numerous attempts, including ML using various color band observations, have been made to identify BDs based on their colors. However, those models often require a large number of color observations, which can be a limitation. This study implemented an ML model by utilizing data from the J, H, and K photometry of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Surveys (UKIDSS) simultaneously, effectively distinguishing celestial objects similar to BDs. The BROWDIE model was trained using UKIDSS data, and based on the model, 118 T dwarfs and 14 Y dwarfs were found in the UKIDSS DR11PLUS LAS L4 zone.</description>

Abstract: The wealth of high-quality observational data from the epoch of reionization that will become available in the next decade motivates further development of modeling techniques for their interpretation. Among the key challenges in modeling reionization are (1) its multi-scale nature, (2) the computational demands of solving the radiative transfer (RT) equation, and (3) the large size of reionization's parameter space. In this paper, we present and validate a new RT code designed to confront these challenges. FlexRT (Flexible Radiative Transfer) combines adaptive ray tracing with a highly flexible treatment of the intergalactic ionizing opacity. This gives the user control over how the intergalactic medium (IGM) is modeled, and provides a way to reduce the computational cost of a FlexRT simulation by orders of magnitude while still accounting for small-scale IGM physics. Alternatively, the user may increase the angular and spatial resolution of the algorithm to run a more traditional reionization simulation. FlexRT has already been used in several contexts, including simulations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high-$z$ quasars, the redshifted 21cm signal from reionization, as well as in higher resolution reionization simulations in smaller volumes. In this work, we motivate and describe the code, and validate it against a set of standard test problems from the Cosmological Radiative Transfer Comparison Project. We find that FlexRT is in broad agreement with a number of existing RT codes in all of these tests. Lastly, we compare FlexRT to an existing adaptive ray tracing code to validate FlexRT in a cosmological reionization simulation.</description>

      <title>Complex Organics Surrounding the FU Ori-Type Object V1057 Cyg Indicative of Sublimated Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FU Ori and EX Lup type objects present natural experiments for understanding a critical stage in the star and planet formation process. These objects offer insight into the diversity of molecules available to forming planetary systems due to a sudden increase in accretion and central luminosity causes the disk and surrounding material to increase in temperature. This allows for volatiles to sublimate off of grains and exist in the gas-phase for tens to hundreds of years post initial outburst. While this dynamic stage may be common for solar-type protostars, observations of the chemical impact of these bursts are rare. In this article, we present observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) of five Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that have undergone outbursts within the past 100 years and catalog the volatile chemistry found within approx 1000 au of the YSO. Only one source clearly shows a line rich spectra with &gt;11 molecules detected including complex organics and water, as is an expected spectra signature for a post-outburst source. This source is V1057 Cyg, and we present it as the northern analog to the well studied and molecule-rich FU Ori source, V883 Ori. Our conclusions on the chemical inventory of the other four sources in our sample are sensitivity limited, as V1057 Cyg contains the highest disk/envelope gas mass.</description>

      <title>Post-Outburst Chemistry in a Very Low-Luminosity Object: Peculiar High Abundance of Nitric Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abridged: Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are deeply embedded, and extremely faint objects and are thought to be in the quiescent phase of the episodic accretion process. They fill an important gap in our understanding of star formation. The VeLLO in the isolated DC3272+18 cloud has undergone an outburst, and is thus an ideal target for investigating the chemical inventory in the gas phase of an object of its type. Observations with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) in four spectral windows in the frequency range of 213.6--272.4~GHz have been carried out to identify molecules that can be directly linked to the past outburst, utilize the line fluxes, column densities, and the abundance ratios of the detected species to characterize the different physical components of the VeLLO, and probe for the presence of complex organic molecules. Nitric oxide (NO) is detected for the first time in a source of this type, and its formation could be induced by the sublimation of grain-surface species during the outburst. A pathway to form NO directly in the gas phase is from the photodissociation products created after the sublimation of H$_2$O and NH$_3$ from the ices. While the present time water snowline has likely retreated to pre-outburst small radius, the volatile NO species is still extensively present in the gas phase, as evident by its high column density relative to methanol in the observations. This suggests that NO could be potentially used to trace the water snowline in outbursting sources. In order to rule out non-thermal desorption processes that could also have led to the formation of NO, this proposition has to be verified with future observations at higher spatial resolution, and by searching for NO in additional targets.</description>

      <title>Identifying Uncertainties in Stellar Evolution Models Using the Open Cluster M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar age estimates are often calculated by interpolating a star's properties in a grid of models. However, different model grids will give different ages for the same star. We used the open cluster M67 to compare four different model grids: DSEP, GARSTEC, MIST, and YREC. Across all model grids, age estimates for main sequence stars were consistently higher than the accepted age of M67, while age estimates for red giant stars were lower. We compared model-generated age and mass values to external constraints as an additional test of the reliability of each model grid. For stars near solar age and metallicity, we recommend using the DSEP model grid to estimate the ages of main sequence stars and the GARSTEC model grid for red giant stars.</description>

      <title>GLoW: novel methods for wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing occur when the signal's wavelength is commensurate to the gravitational radius of the lens. Although potentially detectable in lensed gravitational waves, fast radio bursts and pulsars, accurate numerical predictions are challenging to compute. Here we present novel methods for wave-optics lensing that allow the treatment of general lenses. In addition to a general algorithm, specialized methods optimize symmetric lenses (arbitrary number of images) and generic lenses in the single-image regime. We also develop approximations for simple lenses (point-like and singular isothermal sphere) that drastically outperform known solutions without compromising accuracy. These algorithms are implemented in Gravitational Lensing of Waves (GLoW): an accurate, flexible, and fast code. GLoW efficiently computes the frequency-dependent amplification factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters in O(1 ms) to O(10 ms) depending on the lens configuration and complexity. GLoW is readily applicable to model lensing diffraction on gravitational-wave signals, offering new means to investigate the distribution of dark-matter and large-scale structure with signals from ground and space detectors.</description>

      <title>Identification of a turnover in the initial mass function of a young stellar cluster down to 0.5 M$_{J}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M$_{J}$. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be 2-10 M$_{J}$. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. Here we present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M$_{J}$ within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 {\mu}m, we identified several free floating objects down to ~ 3 M$_{J}$ with sensitivity to 0.5 M$_{J}$. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M$_{J}$ to roughly 12 M$_{J}$, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M$_{J}$. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M$_{J}$.</description>

      <title>Hot Stars in the GALEX Ultraviolet Sky Surveys (GUVcat_AISxSDSS_HS) and the Binary Fraction of Hot Evolved Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 71,364 point-like UV sources with SDSS photometry and GALEX FUV-NUV less or equal 0.1mag. The limit corresponds to stellar Teff greater than 15,000 to 20,000K, slightly depending on gravity but nearly reddening-independent for Milky-Way-type dust. Most sources are hot white-dwarfs (WDs) and sub-dwarfs (SDs). Comparing the SED (GALEX FUV, NUV, SDSS u,g,r,i,z) of 35,294 sources having good photometry with colors of stellar models and known objects, we identify 12,404+1871-1267 binary hot-compact stars with a cooler, less-evolved companion (with a possible 8% to 15% contamination by low-redshift QSOs), and 22,848+1267-3853 single-star candidates. Single-star counts are an upper limit because pairs of similar stars have single-star-like SED, and hot-WDs with main-sequence companions of certain types (depending on WD's radius) are missed or counted as single in the available wavelength range and selection. The catalog offers unique leverage for identifying hot WDs, elusive at longer wavelengths when a cooler, larger companion dominates optical-IR fluxes: 51% of the binary- and 20% of the single-star candidates are previously un-known objects. Gaia DR3 provides a parallax with error less than 20% for 34% of the binaries- and 45% of single-star candidates, allowing Teff, E(B-V), radius and Lbol to be derived from SED analysis. The binary-candidate sample usefully expands the overall current binary-WD census to subpopulations elusive to Gaia and to other searches. The binary fraction among this specific sample of hot-compact objects, albeit with the mentioned biases, B_f&gt;46%, compared with that of their progenitors (&gt;80%-50% for mass range 8-1Msun, Moe (2019)), implies a lower merging rate than found for massive stars by Sana et al (2017).</description>

      <title>Multi-epoch UV $-$ X-ray spectral study of NGC 4151 with AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength spectral study of NGC 4151 based on five epochs of simultaneous AstroSat observations in the near ultra-violet (NUV) to hard X-ray band ($\sim 0.005-80$ keV) during $2017 - 2018$. We derived the intrinsic accretion disk continuum after correcting for internal and Galactic extinction, contributions from broad and narrow line regions, and emission from the host galaxy. We found a bluer continuum at brighter UV flux possibly due to variations in the accretion disk continuum or the UV reddening. We estimated the intrinsic reddening, $E(B-V) \sim 0.4$, using high-resolution HST/STIS spectrum acquired in March 2000. We used thermal Comptonization, neutral and ionized absorption, and X-ray reflection to model the X-ray spectra. We obtained the X-ray absorbing neutral column varying between $N_H \sim 1.2-3.4 \times 10^{23} cm^{-2}$, which are $\sim 100$ times larger than that estimated from UV extinction, assuming the Galactic dust-to-gas ratio. To reconcile this discrepancy, we propose two plausible configurations of the obscurer: (a) a two-zone obscurer consisting of dust-free and dusty regions, divided by the sublimation radius, or (b) a two-phase obscurer consisting of clumpy, dense clouds embedded in a low-density medium, resulting in a scenario where a few dense clouds obscure the compact X-ray source substantially, while the bulk of UV emission arising from the extended accretion disk passes through the low-density medium. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between X-ray absorption column and $NUV-FUV$ color and UV flux, indicative of enhanced winds possibly driven by the 'bluer-when-brighter' UV continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popularity of pulsating stars resides in their capacity of determining several crucial and relevant parameters such as heliocentric distances, ages, metallicity gradients and reddening. RR Lyrae stars are old stellar tracers and have been detected in nearly all nearby galaxies that have been searched for these stars, with just a few exceptions of very low mass dwarfs. Less common but also of great importance are Anomalous Cepheids, indicators of either old or intermediate-age population, depending on their stellar origin. Classical Cepheids are only found within young stellar populations, and because of their brighter absolute magnitudes, they can be detected in galaxies farther than the Local Group. This paper presents a concise review built upon the aforementioned pulsating stars in Local Group dwarf galaxies and some of their applications to infer important properties of their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Matching seismic masses for RR Lyrae-type and oscillating red horizontal-branch stars in M4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters offer a powerful way to test the properties of stellar populations and the late stages of low-mass stellar evolution. In this paper we study oscillating giant stars and overtone RR Lyrae-type pulsators in the nearest globular cluster, M4, with the help of high-precision, continuous light curves collected by the Kepler space telescope in the K2 mission. We determine the frequency composition of five RRc stars and model their physical parameters with a grid of linear pulsation models. We are able, for the first time, to compare seismic masses of RR Lyrae stars directly to the masses of the very similar red horizontal branch stars in the same stellar population, independently determined from asteroseismic scaling relations. We find a close match, with an average seismic mass of $0.651\pm0.028\,M_\odot$ for RR Lyrae stars and $0.657\pm0.034\,M_\odot$ for red horizontal-branch stars. While the validity of our RR Lyrae masses still relies on the similarity of neighboring horizontal branch subgroups, this result strongly indicates that RRc stars may indeed exhibit high-degree, $l = 8$ and 9 non-radial modes, and modeling these modes can provide realistic mass estimates. We also determine the He content of the cluster to be $Y = 0.266\pm 0.008$, and compare the seismic masses for our sample of RR Lyrae to theoretical mass relations and highlight the limitations of these relations.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively different turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second (the "low-$\beta$ state"), which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress $\alpha \sim 1$. The low-$\beta$ state is realized in simulations that begin with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this is true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta\ll1$, provided the thermal scale-height of the disk is well-resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we find may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work including the implications of our results for global accretion disk simulations.</description>

      <title>Nature vs Nurture: Three Dimensional MHD Simulations of Misaligned Embedded Circum-Single Disks within an AGN Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mass black holes in the disks around active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational wave detections by LIGO/VIRGO. Recent studies suggest this environment fosters the formation and merger of binary black holes. Many of these studies often assumed a simple, laminar AGN disk without magnetic fields or turbulence. In this work, we present the first 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of circum-single disks around isolated and binary black holes in strongly magnetized, stratified accretion disks with turbulence driven by magneto-rotational instability. We simulated three scenarios with varying initial net-vertical magnetic field strengths: weak, intermediate, and strong. Our results show that weakly magnetized models produce circum-single disks aligned with the AGN disk's equatorial plane, similar to past hydrodynamic simulations. However, intermediate and strong magnetic fields result in randomly misaligned disks, contingent upon the availability of local ambient angular momentum within turbulent regions. Our findings emphasize the significant impact of ambient gas in the AGN disk on the inclination of circum-single disks, linked to magnetically induced inhomogeneity and angular momentum during disk formation. The presence of misaligned disks, both in single and binary black hole systems, could have profound implications for the long-term evolution of black hole spin and the inclination of the disk at the horizon scale.</description>

It is a necessary investment of time and effort to obtain data to advance a research topic. Therefore, the success of an observation proposal is a condition for progress in observational research. This guide was created to offer a straightforward, practical, and comprehensive resource for applicants who are preparing a Gemini Observatory proposal. It reviews the fundamentals of an observation proposal, including its content and evaluation criteria, to help applicants organize their submissions effectively and improve specific aspects of their presentations. This manuscript is inspired by the recommendations of the User Advisory Council established in the documents ''Criterios de evaluaci\'on de propuestas por parte del NTAC'' (National Time Allocation Committee), ''Consideraciones b\'asicas para la presentaci\'on de propuestas Gemini'', and in experiences of members of the NTAC.</description>

      <title>The $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relation up to $z\sim2$ through decomposition of COSMOS-Web NIRCam images</title>

Abstract: Our knowledge of relations between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies at $z\gtrsim1$ is still limited, even though being actively sought out to $z\sim6$. Here, we use the high resolution and sensitivity of JWST to measure the host galaxy properties for 107 X-ray-selected type-I AGNs at $0.68&lt;z&lt;2.5$ with rest-frame optical/near-infrared imaging from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. Black hole masses ($\log\left(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\right)\sim6.9-9.6$) are available from previous spectroscopic campaigns. We extract the host galaxy components from four NIRCam broadband images and the HST/ACS F814W image by applying a 2D image decomposition technique. We detect the host galaxy for $\sim90\%$ of the sample after subtracting the unresolved AGN emission. With host photometry free of AGN emission, we determine the stellar mass of the host galaxies to be $\log\left(M_*/M_\odot\right)\sim9.5-11.6$ through SED fitting and measure the evolution of the mass relation between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Considering selection biases and measurement uncertainties, we find that the $M_\mathrm{ BH}/M_*$ ratio evolves as $\left(1+z\right)^{0.48_{-0.62}^{+0.31}}$ thus remains essentially constant or exhibits mild evolution up to $z\sim2.5$. We also see an amount of scatter ($\sigma_{\mu}=0.30^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$), similar to the local relation and consistent with low-$z$ studies, and a non-causal cosmic assembly history where mergers contribute to the statistical averaging towards the local relation is still feasible. We highlight improvements to come with larger samples from JWST and, particularly, Euclid, which will exceed the statistical power of current wide and deep surveys.</description>

      <title>A new census of dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at z=0.7-2 with JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper utilizes the JWST MIRI multi-band imaging data from the SMILES survey (5-25micron), complemented with HST and NIRCam photometric and spectroscopic data from the JADES and FRESCO surveys for 443 star-forming (non-AGN) galaxies at z=0.7-2.0 to extend the study of dust and PAH emission to a new mass and SFR parameter space beyond our local universe. We find a strong correlation between the fraction of dust in PAHs (PAH fraction, q_PAH) with stellar mass. Moreover, the PAH fraction behavior as a function of gas-phase metallicity is similar to that at z~0 from previous studies, suggesting a universal relation: q_PAH is constant (~3.4%) above a metallicity of ~ 0.5$Z_{\odot}$ and decreases to &lt;1% at metallicities $&lt;0.3Z_{\odot}$. This indicates that metallicity is a good indicator of the ISM properties that affect the balance between the formation and destruction of PAHs. The lack of a redshift evolution from z~0-2 also implies that above $0.5\,Z_{\odot}$, the PAH emission effectively traces obscured luminosity and the previous locally-calibrated PAH-SFR calibrations remain applicable in this metallicity regime. We observe a strong correlation between obscured UV luminosity fraction (ratio of obscured to total luminosity) and stellar mass. Above the stellar mass of $&gt;5\times 10^9M_{\odot}$, on average, more than half of the emitted luminosity is obscured, while there exists a non-negligible population of lower mass galaxies with &gt;50% obscured fractions. At a fixed mass, the obscured fraction correlates with SFR surface density. This is a result of higher dust covering fractions in galaxies with more compact star forming regions. Similarly, galaxies with high IRX (IR to UV luminosity) at a given mass or UV continuum slope tend to have higher SFR surface density and shallower attenuation curves, owing to their higher effective dust optical depths and more compact star forming regions.</description>

      <title>A merger-driven scenario for clumpy galaxy formation in the epoch of reionization: Physical properties of clumps in the FirstLight simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with superb angular resolution have revealed the existence of clumpy galaxies at high redshift through the detection of rest-frame optical emission lines. We use the FirstLight simulation to study the properties of (sub-)galactic clumps that are bright in [OIII] 5007$\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ line with flux greater than $\sim 10^{-18} \, {\rm erg\, s^{-1}\, cm^{-2}}$, to be detected by JWST. For 62 simulated galaxies that have stellar masses of $(0.5-6) \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$ at $z=5$, we find clumps in 1828 snapshots in the redshift range $z = 9.5-5.5$. The clumps are identified by the surface density of star formation rate. About one-tenth of the snapshots show the existence of clumpy systems with two or more components. Most of the clumps are formed by mergers and can be characterized by their ages; central clumps dominated by stellar populations older than 50 Myr, and off-centered clumps dominated by younger stellar populations with specific star formation rates of $\sim 50 \, {\rm Gyr^{-1}}$. The latter type of young clumps is formed from gas debris in the tidal tails of major mergers with baryonic mass ratios of $1 \leq q &lt; 4$. The merger-induced clumps are short-lived, and merge within a dynamical time of several tens million years. The number density of the clumpy systems is estimated to be $\sim 10^{-5}\, {\rm cMpc^{-3}}$, which is large enough to be detected in recent JWST surveys.</description>

      <title>The COS CGM Compendium V: The Dichotomy of OVI Associated with Low- and High-Metallicity Cool Gas at z &lt; 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the \ovi\ content and kinematics for 126 {\hi}-selected absorbers at $0.14 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.73$ for which the metallicities of their cool photoionized phase have been determined. We separate the absorbers into 100 strong {\lya} forest systems (SLFSs with $15 \la$\,{\colden}\,$&lt; 16.2$) and 26 partial Lyman Limit systems (pLLSs with $16.2\le$\,{\colden}\,$\le 17.2$). The sample is drawn from the COS CGM Compendium (CCC) and has \ovi\ coverage in $\sn \geq 8$ {\it HST}/COS G130M/G160M QSO spectra, yielding a $2\sigma$ completeness level of {\coldenovi}$\,\geq 13.6$. The \ovi\ detection rates differ substantially between low-metallicity (LM; {\xh} $\leq -1.4$) and high-metallicity (HM; {\xh} $&gt; -1.4$) SLFSs, with 20\% and 60\% detection rates, respectively. The \ovi\ detection frequency for the HM and LM pLLSs is, however, similar at $\sim$60\%. The SLFSs and pLLSs without detected \ovi\ are consistent with the absorbing gas being in a single phase, while those with \ovi\ trace multiphase gas. We show that the \ovi\ velocity widths and column densities have different distributions in LM and HM gas. We find a strong correlation between \ovi\ column density and metallicity. The strongest (\coldenovi$\,\ga 14$) and broadest {\ovi} absorbers are nearly always associated with HM absorbers, while weaker \ovi\ absorbers are found in both LM and HM absorbers. From comparisons with galaxy-selected and blind \ovi\ surveys, we conclude absorbers with \coldenovi$\,\ga 14$ most likely arise in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of star-forming galaxies. Absorbers with weak \ovi\ likely trace the extended CGM or intergalactic medium (IGM), while those without \ovi\ likely originate in the IGM.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Build-up in the first 1.5 Gyr of Cosmic History: Insights from the Stellar Mass Function at $z\sim4-9$ from JWST NIRCam Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining the public JWST/NIRCam imaging programs CEERS, PRIMER and JADES, spanning a total area of $\sim500\,{\rm arcmin}^2$, we obtain a sample of $&gt;$30,000 galaxies at $z_{\rm phot}\sim4-9$ that allows us to perform a complete, rest-optical selected census of the galaxy population at $z&gt;3$. Comparing the stellar mass $M_*$ and the UV-slope $\beta$ distributions between JWST- and HST-selected samples, we generally find very good agreement and no significant biases. Nevertheless, JWST enables us to probe a new population of UV-red galaxies that was missing from previous HST-based Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) samples. We measure galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) at $z\sim4-9$ down to limiting masses of $10^{7.5}-10^{8.5}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, finding steep low mass slopes over the entire redshift range, reaching values of $\alpha\approx-2$ at $z\gtrsim6$. At the high-mass end, UV-red galaxies dominate at least out to $z\sim6$. The implied redshift evolution of the SMF suggests a rapid build-up of massive dust-obscured or quiescent galaxies from $z\sim6$ to $z\sim4$ as well as an enhanced efficiency of star formation towards earlier times ($z\gtrsim6$). Finally, we show that the galaxy mass density grows by a factor $\sim20\times$ from $z\sim9$ to $z\sim4$. Our results emphasize the importance of rest-frame optically-selected samples in inferring accurate distributions of physical properties and studying the mass build-up of galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr of cosmic history.</description>

      <title>B-fields And dust in interstelLar fiLAments using Dust POLarization (BALLAD-POL): II. Testing the Radiative Torque Paradigm in Musca and OMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission caused by aligned dust grains is a valuable tool to characterize magnetic fields (B-fields) and constrain dust properties. However, the physics of grain alignment is not fully understood. To test the popular paradigm of radiative torque (RAT) theory, including RAT alignment (RAT-A) and disruption (RAT-D), we use dust polarization data observed by {\it Planck} and SOFIA/HAWC+ toward two filaments with contrasting physical conditions: Musca, a quiet filament, and OMC-1, a highly dynamic filament due to feedback. We analyze various relations of the observed polarization fraction, $P$, with gas column density, $\NHt$, dust temperature, $\Td$, and polarization angle dispersion function, $\S$. We found that $P$ decreases with increasing $\S$ and increasing $\NHt$, as expected from RAT-A. On the other hand, the $P-\Td$ relation is more complicated; it is a linear correlation at low $\Td$ but turns into an anti-correlation when $\Td$ reaches a certain high value. Next, we compute the polarization fraction on a pixel-by-pixel with B-fields in the plane of the sky using the DustPOL code based on RAT, incorporate the depolarization effect by B-field tangling using $\S$, and compare the realistic polarization model with observations of Musca and OMC-1. For Musca with well-ordered B-fields, our numerical model reproduces the decline of $P$ toward the filament spine (aka. polarization hole), having high $\NHt$ and low $\Td$, indicating the loss of grain alignment efficiency due to RAT-A. For OMC-1, with stronger B-field variations and higher $\Td$, our model can reproduce the observed $P-\Td$ and $P-N(\rm H_{2})$ relations only if the depolarization effect resulting from B-field tangling and RAT-D effect are taken into account. Our results provide more robust observational evidence for the RAT paradigm, particularly the recently discovered RAT-D.</description>

      <title>Resolved UV and optical color gradients reveal environmental influence on galaxy evolution at redshift z$\sim$1.6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The changes in colors across a galaxy are intimately connected to the galaxy's formation, growth, quenching history, and dust content. A particularly important epoch in the growth of galaxies is near $z \sim 2$ often referred to as `cosmic noon', where galaxies on average reach the peak of their star formation. We study a population of 125 cluster galaxies at $z \sim 1.6$ in three Hubble Space Telescope (HST) filters, F475W, F625W, and F160W, roughly corresponding to the rest-frame FUV, NUV, and r band, respectively. By comparing to a control sample of 200 field galaxies at similar redshift, we reveal clear, statistically significant differences in the overall spatially resolved colors and color gradients in galaxies across these two different environments. On average, cluster galaxies have redder UV colors in both the inner and outer regions bounded by $r_{\mathrm{50}}$, as well as an overall wider dispersion of outside-in color gradients. The presence of these observed differences, along with evidence from ancillary data from previous studies, strongly suggests that the environment drives these population-level color differences, by affecting the stellar populations and/or dust content.</description>

      <title>Probing Three-Dimensional Magnetic Fields: III -- Synchrotron Emission and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron observation serves as a tool for studying magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and intracluster medium, yet its ability to unveil three-dimensional (3D) magnetic fields, meaning probing the field'splane-of-the-sky (POS) orientation, inclination angle relative to the line of sight, and magnetization from one observational data, remains largely underexplored. Inspired by the latest insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we found that synchrotron emission's intensity structures inherently reflect this anisotropy, providing crucial information to aid in 3D magnetic field studies: (i) the structure's elongation gives the magnetic field's POS orientation and (ii) the structure's anisotropy degree and topology reveal the inclination angle and magnetization. Capitalizing on this foundation, we integrate a machine learning approach-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-to extract this latent information, thereby facilitating the exploration of 3D magnetic fields. The model is trained on synthetic synchrotron emission maps, derived from 3D MHD turbulence simulations encompassing a range of sub-Alfv\'enic to super-Alfv\'enic conditions. We show that the CNN is physically interpretable and the CNN is capable of obtaining the POS orientation, inclination angle, and magnetization. Additionally, we test the CNN against the noise effect and the missing low-spatial frequency. We show that this CNN-based approach maintains a high degree of robustness even when only high-spatial frequencies are maintained. This renders the method particularly suitable for application to interferometric data lacking single-dish measurements. We applied this trained CNN to the synchrotron observations of a diffuse region. The CNN-predicted POS magnetic field orientation shows a statistical agreement with that derived from synchrotron polarization.</description>

      <title>Kinematics and metallicity of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XVIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate "backsplash galaxy" that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and $\alpha$-enhancements ([$\alpha$/Fe]) for 56 probable members. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors ($\delta [Fe/H] &lt; 0.3$), parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using the maximum likelihood coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models, due to a sharp metal-rich cutoff. We estimated Andromeda XVIII's mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using the maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though subpopulations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is -337.2 km s$^{-1}$, such that the line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. For possible causes of this quenching, we considered gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 or due to a past major merger. However, we cannot rule out internal feedback (i.e., a terminal wind).</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) X. Probing the early chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy with carbon abundances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to constrain the chemo-dynamical properties of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy using carbon abundances. Our sample from the \textit{Pristine} Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) includes $\sim 350$ metal-poor ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-1.5$) stars in the main body of Sgr with good quality spectroscopic observations. Our metal-poor Sgr population has a larger velocity dispersion than metal-rich Sgr from the literature, which could be explained by outside-in star formation, extreme Galactic tidal perturbations and/or the presence of a metal-rich disc/bar $+$ a metal-poor halo. The average carbon abundance [C/Fe] in Sgr is similar to that of other classical dwarf galaxies (DGs) and consistently lower than in the Milky Way by $\sim0.2-0.3$~dex at low metallicity. The interstellar medium in DGs, including Sgr, may have retained yields from more energetic Population~III~and~II supernovae (SNe), thereby reducing the average [C/Fe]. Additionally, SNe~Ia, producing more Fe than C, would start to contribute at lower metallicity in DGs/Sgr than in the Galaxy. The presence of a [C/Fe] gradient for Sgr stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ ($\sim 6.8\times 10^{-4}\ \rm{dex \ arcmin^{-1}}$) suggests that SNe~Ia contributed in the system at those metallicities, especially in its inner regions. There is a low frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Sgr sample. At higher metallicity/carbon abundance (mostly CEMP-s) this may be due to photometric selection effects, but those are less likely to affect CEMP-no stars. We propose that, given the lower average [C/Fe] in DGs, using the same CEMP definition ([C/Fe]~$&gt;+0.7$) as in the Galaxy under-predicts the number of CEMP stars in DGs, and for Sgr a cut at [C/Fe]$~\sim +0.35$ may be more appropriate, which brings the frequency of CEMP stars in agreement with that in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Reconciling M/L Ratios Across Cosmic Time: a Concordance IMF for Massive Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06281</link>

Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is thought to be bottom-heavy in the cores of the most massive galaxies, with an excess of low mass stars compared to the Milky Way. However, studies of the kinematics of quiescent galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;5 find M/L ratios that indicate lighter IMFs. Light IMFs have also been proposed for the unexpected populations of luminous galaxies that JWST has uncovered at z&gt;7, to reduce tensions with galaxy formation models. Here we explore 'ski slope' IMFs that are simultaneously bottom-heavy, with a steep slope at low stellar masses, and top-heavy, with a shallow slope at high masses. We derive a form of the IMF for massive galaxies that is consistent with measurements in the local universe and yet produces relatively low M/L ratios at high redshift. This concordance IMF has slopes $\gamma_1=2.40\pm0.09$, $\gamma_2=2.00\pm0.14$, and $\gamma_3=1.85\pm0.11$ in the regimes 0.08-0.5 Msun, 0.5-1 Msun, and &gt;1 Msun respectively. The IMF parameter $\alpha$, the mass excess compared to a Milky Way IMF, ranges from $\log(\alpha)\approx+0.3$ for present-day galaxies to $\log(\alpha)\approx-0.1$ for their star forming progenitors. The concordance IMF applies only to the central regions of the most massive galaxies, with velocity dispersions ~300 km/s, and their progenitors. However, it can be generalized using a previously-measured relation between $\alpha$ and $\sigma$. We arrive at the following modification to the Kroupa (2001) IMF for galaxies with $\sigma\gtrsim 160$ km/s: $\gamma_1\approx1.3+4.3\log\sigma_{160}$; $\gamma_2\approx2.3-1.2\log\sigma_{160}$; and $\gamma_3\approx2.3-1.7\log\sigma_{160}$, with $\sigma_{160}=\sigma/160$ km/s. If galaxies grow primarily inside-out, so that velocity dispersions are relatively stable, these relations should also hold at high redshift.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Enhancing photometric redshift estimation using DEEPz</title>

Abstract: We present photometric redshifts for 1 341 559 galaxies from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) over 50.38 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ of sky to $i_{\rm AB}=23$. Redshift estimation is performed using DEEPz, a deep-learning photometric redshift code. We analyse the photometric redshift precision when varying the photometric and spectroscopic samples. Furthermore, we examine observational and instrumental effects on the precision of the photometric redshifts, and we compare photometric redshift measurements with those obtained using a template method-fitting BCNz2. Finally, we examine the use of photometric redshifts in the identification of close galaxy pairs. We find that the combination of samples from W1+W3 in the training of DEEPz significantly enhances the precision of photometric redshifts. This also occurs when we recover narrow band fluxes using broad bands measurements. We show that DEEPz determines the redshifts of galaxies in the prevailing spectroscopic catalogue used in the training of DEEPz with greater precision. For the faintest galaxies ($i_{\rm AB}=21-23$), we find that DEEPz improves over BCNz2 both in terms of the precision (20-50 per cent smaller scatter) and in returning a smaller outlier fraction in two of the wide fields. The catalogues were tested for the identification of close galaxy pairs, showing that DEEPz is effective for the identification of close galaxy pairs for samples with $i_{\rm AB} &lt; 22.5$ and redshift $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$. In addition, identifying close galaxy pairs common between DEEPz and BCNz2 is a promising approach to improving the purity of the catalogues of these systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray induced sputtering of interstellar formaldehyde ices</title>

Abstract: H2CO is a ubiquitous molecule in the ISM and in the gas phase of prestellar cores, and is likely present in ice mantles, but its main desorption mechanism is unknown. In this paper our aim is to quantify the desorption efficiency of H2CO upon cosmic-ray impact in order to determine whether cosmic-ray induced sputtering could account for the H2CO abundance observed in prestellar cores. Using a heavy-ion beam as a cosmic-ray analogue at the GANIL accelerator, we irradiated pure H2CO ice films at 10 K under high vacuum conditions and monitored the ice film evolution with infrared spectroscopy and the composition of the sputtered species in the gas phase using mass spectrometry. We derived both the effective and intact sputtering yield of pure H2CO ices. We find that H2CO easily polymerises under heavy-ion irradiation in the ice, and is also radiolysed into CO and CO2. In the gas phase, the dominant sputtered species is CO and intact H2CO is only a minor species. We determine an intact sputtering yield for pure H2CO ices $2.5\times 10^3$ molecules ion$^{-1}$ for an electronic stopping power of $S_e\sim2830$ eV ($10^{15}$ molecules cm$^{-2}$)$^{-1}$. The corresponding cosmic-ray sputtering rate is $\Gamma_\mathrm{CRD}=1.5\times 10^{18}\zeta$ molecules cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, where $\zeta$ is the rate of cosmic-ray ionisation of molecular hydrogen in the ISM. In the frame of a simple steady-state chemical model of freeze-out and non-thermal desorption, we find that this experimental cosmic-ray sputtering rate is too low (by an order of magnitude) to account for the observed H2CO gas-phase abundance we derived in the prestellar core L1689B. We find however that this abundance can be reproduced if we assume that H2CO diluted in CO or CO2 ices co-desorbs at the same sputtering rate as pure CO or pure CO2 ices.</description>

      <title>Accretion vs. Core-Filament Collision: Implications for Streamer Formation in Per-emb-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent millimeter and submillimeter observations have unveiled elongated and asymmetric structures around protostars. These structures, referred to as streamers, often exhibit coherent velocity gradients, seemingly indicating a directed gas flow towards the protostars. However, their origin and role in star formation remain uncertain. A protostellar core Per-emb-2, located in Barnard 1, has a relatively large streamer with $10^4$ au, which is more prominent in emission from carbon chain molecules. We aim to unveil the formation mechanism of this streamer. We conducted mapping observations towards Per-emb-2 using the NRO 45-m telescope. We targeted carbon chain molecular lines such as CCS, HC$_3$N, and HC$_5$N. Using astrodendro, we identified one protostellar and four starless cores, including three new detections, on the Herschel map. The starless and protostellar cores are more or less gravitationally bound. We discovered strong CCS and HC$_3$N emissions extending from the north to the south, appearing to bridge the gap between the protostellar core and the starless core north of it. This bridge spans $3\times 10^4$ au with the velocities from 6.5 to 7.0 km s$^{-1}$. The bridge has the velocity gradient opposite to the streamer. Thus, the streamer is unlikely to be connected to this bridge, suggesting that the streamer does not have an accretion origin. We propose that a collision between a spherical core and the filament has shaped the density structure in this region, consequently triggering star formation within the head-tail-shaped core. In this core-filament collision (CFC) scenario, the collision appears to have fragmented the filament into two structures. The streamer is a bow structure, while the bridge is a remnant of the shock-compressed filament. Thus, we conclude that the Per-emb-2 streamer does not significantly contribute to the mass accumulation towards the protostar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a procedure for calculating the heating of, and the infrared emission from, dust in a homogeneous spherical shell surrounded by a spherically symmetric source of radiation. The results are applicable to newly formed dust either in supernova ejecta or in the circumstellar medium that has been swept up by the expanding shock wave. They can also be applied to the heating and IR emission from dust in clumps or clouds embedded in a homogeneous radiation field.</description>

      <title>Footprints of Axion-Like Particle in Pulsar Timing Array Data and James Webb Space Telescope Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), which can unveil the formation of primordial seeds of inhomogeneities in the early universe. With the SGWB parameters inferred from PTAs data, we can make a prediction of the seeds for early galaxy formation from the domain walls in the axion-like particles (ALPs) field distribution. This also naturally provides a solution to the observation of high redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope. The predicted photon coupling of the ALP is within the reach of future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of weakly collisional plasma: continuous spectra, discrete eigenmodes, and the decay of echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a weakly collisional plasma is described by the Boltzmann-Poisson equations with the Lenard-Bernstein collision operator. We perform a perturbative analysis of these equations, and obtain exact analytic solutions, enabling definitive resolutions to long-standing controversies regarding the impact of weak collisions on continuous spectra and Landau eigenmodes. Unlike some previous studies, we retain both damping and diffusion terms in the collision operator. We find that the linear response is a temporal convolution of a continuum that depends on the continuous velocities of particles, and discrete modes that encapsulate coherent oscillations. The discrete modes are exponentially damped over time due to collective effects (Landau damping) as well as collisional dissipation. The continuum is also damped by collisions but somewhat differently. Up to a collision time, which is the inverse of the collision frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$, the continuum decay is driven by velocity diffusion and occurs super-exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu^{-1/3}_{\mathrm{c}}$. After a collision time, however, the continuum decay is driven by the collisional damping of particle velocities and diffusion of their positions, and occurs exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu_{\mathrm{c}}$. This hitherto unknown, slow exponential decay causes perturbations to damp the most on scales comparable to the mean free path, but very slowly on larger scales, which establishes the local thermal equilibrium, the essence of the fluid limit. The long-term decay of the response is driven by the discrete modes on scales smaller than the mean free path, but, on larger scales, is governed by the slowly decaying continuum and the least damped discrete mode. Our analysis firmly establishes a long-sought connection between the collisionless and fluid limits of weakly collisional plasmas.</description>

      <title>Broadband Multi-wavelength Properties of M87 during the 2018 EHT Campaign including a Very High Energy Flaring Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>A Model for Eruptive Mass Loss in Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well-understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a locally super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with masses $10-100~M_\odot$ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to $\sim10^{-2}~M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the HR diagram between $3.5 \lesssim \log(T_\mathrm{eff}/\mathrm{K}) \lesssim 4.0$. This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses $\gtrsim20~M_\odot$ from evolving to become red supergiants, with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and therefore offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of red supergiants in that mass regime.</description>

      <title>Binary Yellow Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds I: Photometric Candidate Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have constrained the binary fraction of evolved populations of massive stars in local galaxies such as red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, but the binary fraction of yellow supergiants (YSGs) in the Hertzsprung Gap remains unconstrained. Binary evolution theory predicts that the Hertzsprung Gap is home to multiple populations of binary systems with varied evolutionary histories. In this paper, we develop a method to distinguish single YSGs from YSG plus O- or B-type main sequence binaries using optical and ultraviolet photometry, and then apply this method to identify candidate YSG binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. After constructing a set of combined stellar atmosphere models, we find that optical photometry is, given typical measurement and reddening uncertainties, sufficient to discern single YSGs from YSG+OB binaries if the OB-star is at least $\sim5$M$_{\odot}$ for T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 4000 K, but requires a $\sim$20M$_{\odot}$ OB star for YSGs up to T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 9000 K. For these hotter YSG temperatures, ultraviolet photometry allows binaries with OB companions as small as $\sim$7M$_{\odot}$ to be identified. We use color-color spaces developed from these models to search for evidence of excess blue or ultraviolet light in a set of $\sim$1000 YSG candidates in the Magellanic Clouds. We identify hundreds of candidate YSG binary systems and report a preliminary fraction of YSGs that show a blue/UV color excess of 20-60\%. Spectroscopic follow-up is now required to confirm the true nature of this population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. The authors now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>
