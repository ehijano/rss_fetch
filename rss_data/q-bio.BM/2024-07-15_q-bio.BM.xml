      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model has been validated on two widely used AntiCP 2.0 benchmark datasets and has achieved state-of-the-art performance. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>

      <title>Unifying Sequences, Structures, and Descriptions for Any-to-Any Protein Generation with the Large Multimodal Model HelixProtX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are fundamental components of biological systems and can be represented through various modalities, including sequences, structures, and textual descriptions. Despite the advances in deep learning and scientific large language models (LLMs) for protein research, current methodologies predominantly focus on limited specialized tasks -- often predicting one protein modality from another. These approaches restrict the understanding and generation of multimodal protein data. In contrast, large multimodal models have demonstrated potential capabilities in generating any-to-any content like text, images, and videos, thus enriching user interactions across various domains. Integrating these multimodal model technologies into protein research offers significant promise by potentially transforming how proteins are studied. To this end, we introduce HelixProtX, a system built upon the large multimodal model, aiming to offer a comprehensive solution to protein research by supporting any-to-any protein modality generation. Unlike existing methods, it allows for the transformation of any input protein modality into any desired protein modality. The experimental results affirm the advanced capabilities of HelixProtX, not only in generating functional descriptions from amino acid sequences but also in executing critical tasks such as designing protein sequences and structures from textual descriptions. Preliminary findings indicate that HelixProtX consistently achieves superior accuracy across a range of protein-related tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models. By integrating multimodal large models into protein research, HelixProtX opens new avenues for understanding protein biology, thereby promising to accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Any-Property-Conditional Molecule Generation with Self-Criticism using Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules is challenging, with most representations leading to generative models producing many invalid molecules. Spanning Tree-based Graph Generation (STGG) is a promising approach to ensure the generation of valid molecules, outperforming state-of-the-art SMILES and graph diffusion models for unconditional generation. In the real world, we want to be able to generate molecules conditional on one or multiple desired properties rather than unconditionally. Thus, in this work, we extend STGG to multi-property-conditional generation. Our approach, STGG+, incorporates a modern Transformer architecture, random masking of properties during training (enabling conditioning on any subset of properties and classifier-free guidance), an auxiliary property-prediction loss (allowing the model to self-criticize molecules and select the best ones), and other improvements. We show that STGG+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditional generation, and reward maximization.</description>

      <title>ProLLM: Protein Chain-of-Thoughts Enhanced LLM for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06649</link>

Abstract: The prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding biological functions and diseases. Previous machine learning approaches to PPI prediction mainly focus on direct physical interactions, ignoring the broader context of nonphysical connections through intermediate proteins, thus limiting their effectiveness. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a new opportunity for addressing this complex biological challenge. By transforming structured data into natural language prompts, we can map the relationships between proteins into texts. This approach allows LLMs to identify indirect connections between proteins, tracing the path from upstream to downstream. Therefore, we propose a novel framework ProLLM that employs an LLM tailored for PPI for the first time. Specifically, we propose Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT), which replicates the biological mechanism of signaling pathways as natural language prompts. ProCoT considers a signaling pathway as a protein reasoning process, which starts from upstream proteins and passes through several intermediate proteins to transmit biological signals to downstream proteins. Thus, we can use ProCoT to predict the interaction between upstream proteins and downstream proteins. The training of ProLLM employs the ProCoT format, which enhances the model's understanding of complex biological problems. In addition to ProCoT, this paper also contributes to the exploration of embedding replacement of protein sites in natural language prompts, and instruction fine-tuning in protein knowledge datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProLLM through rigorous validation against benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability.
