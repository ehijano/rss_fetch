      <title>Quantum Yang-Mills Charges in Strongly Coupled 2D Lattice QCD with Three Flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of the truly gauge-invariant and conserved charges of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, focusing on lattice QCD in the strong coupling regime. The construction of those charges uses the integral version of the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills equations, and they correspond to the eigenvalues of a charge operator. The gauge invariance of the charges suggests that they are not confined, hence hadronic states may carry them. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we evaluate the correlation functions of those charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the gauge group SU(N) (N=2,3) and Grassmannian variables - the fermionic fields. Our results show that the expectation values of the lowest non-trivial charges are nonzero for baryon and meson states but vanish for non-gauge-invariant states, supporting the interpretation that hadrons indeed carry these charges. While renormalization effects and higher-order contributions remain to be analyzed, these findings point toward a potential link between gauge-invariant charges and confinement.</description>

      <title>Non-local integrals of motion for deformed $W$-algebra $W_{q,t}(g)$ associated with $g=A_l^{(1)}, D_l^{(1)}, E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an infinite set of non-local integrals of motion for the deformed $W$-algebra $W_{q,t}(g)$ associated with the affine Lie algebras $g=A_l^{(1)}, D_l^{(1)}$ and $E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$.They can be regarded as a two-parameter deformation of trace of the monodromy matrix of the $g$-KdV theory. Commutativity of the non-local integrals of motion is shown in the case of $g=A_l^{(1)}$ and $D_l^{(1)}$ by a direct calculation. In the case of $g=E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$ it is a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Infinite-peakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of (conservative) low regularity solutions to the Camassa-Holm equation on the line by exploiting the classical moment problem (in the framework of generalized indefinite strings) to develop the inverse spectral transform method. In particular, we identify explicitly the solutions that are amenable to this approach, which include solutions made up of infinitely many peaked solitons (peakons). We determine which part of the solution can be recovered from the moments of the underlying spectral measure and provide explicit formulas. We show that the solution can be recovered completely if the corresponding moment problem is determinate, in which case the solution is a (potentially infinite) superposition of peakons. However, we also explore the situation when the underlying moment problem is indeterminate.
  As an application, our results are then used to investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. We will demonstrate this on three exemplary cases of solutions with: (i) discrete underlying spectrum (one may choose for this initial data corresponding to Al-Salam-Carlitz II polynomials; notice that they correspond to an indeterminate moment problem); (ii) step-like initial data associated with the Laguerre polynomials, and (iii) asymptotically eventually periodic initial data associated with the Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <title>Integrable twelve-component nonlinear dynamical system on a quasi-one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bearing in mind the potential physical applicability of multicomponent completely integrable nonlinear dynamical models on quasi-one-dimensional lattices we have developed the novel twelve-component and six-component semi-discrete nonlinear inregrable systems in the framework of semi-discrete Ablowitz--Kaup--Newell--Segur scheme. The set of lowest local conservation laws found by the generalized direct recurrent technique was shown to be indispensable constructive tool in the reduction procedure from the prototype to actual field variables. Two types of admissible symmetries for the twelve-component system and one type of symmetry for the six-component system have been established. The mathematical structure of total local current was shown to support the charge transportation only by four of six subsystems incorporated into the twelve-component system under study. The twelve-component system is able to model the actions of external parametric drive and external uniform magnetic field via time dependencies and phase factors of coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>All correlation functions of the open XXX spin 1/2 quantum chains for unparallel boundary magnetic fields with one constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.07992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this first paper, we start the analysis of correlation functions of quantum spin chains with general integrable boundary conditions. We initiate these computations for the open XXX spin 1/2 quantum chains with some unparallel magnetic fields allowing for a spectrum characterization in terms of homogeneous Baxter like TQ-equations, in the framework of the quantum separation of variables (SoV). Previous SoV analysis leads to the formula for the scalar products of the so-called separate states. Here, we solve the remaining fundamental steps allowing for the computation of correlation functions. In particular, we rederive the ground state density in the thermodynamic limit thanks to SoV approach, we compute the so-called boundary-bulk decomposition of boundary separate states and the action of local operators on these separate states in the case of unparallel boundary magnetic fields. These findings allow us to derive multiple integral formulae for these correlation functions similar to those previously known for the open XXX quantum spin chain with parallel magnetic fields.</description>
