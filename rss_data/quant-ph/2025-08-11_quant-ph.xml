      <title>Quantum Resource Management in the NISQ Era: Implications and Perspectives from Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers represent a radical technological breakthrough in information processing by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve highly complex problems beyond the reach of classical systems. However, in the current NISQ era (noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices), the available hardware presents several limitations, such as a limited number of qubits, high error rates, and short coherence times. Efficient management of quantum resources, both physical and logical, is especially relevant in the design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the role of resources in current uses of NISQ devices, identifying their relevance and implications for quantum software engineering. With this contribution, we aim to strengthen the field of Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE) and move toward scalable and reliable quantum software development</description>

      <title>End-to-End Efficient Quantum Thermal and Ground State Preparation Made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new quantum algorithms for thermal and ground state preparation based on system-bath interactions. These algorithms require only forward evolution under a system-bath Hamiltonian in which the bath is a single reusable ancilla qubit, making them especially well-suited for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. By carefully designing the bath and interaction Hamiltonians, we prove that the fixed point of the dynamics accurately approximates the desired quantum state. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees on the mixing time for several physically relevant models, thereby providing a rigorous justification for the end-to-end efficiency of system-bath interaction models in thermal and ground state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we design quantum algorithms that are more efficient than classical algorithms to solve time-dependent and finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in two distinct settings: (1) In the exact dynamics setting, where the agent has full knowledge of the environment's dynamics (i.e., transition probabilities), we prove that our $\textbf{Quantum Value Iteration (QVI)}$ algorithm $\textbf{QVI-1}$ achieves a quadratic speedup in the size of the action space $(A)$ compared with the classical value iteration algorithm for computing the optimal policy ($\pi^{*}$) and the optimal V-value function ($V_{0}^{*}$). Furthermore, our algorithm $\textbf{QVI-2}$ provides an additional speedup in the size of the state space $(S)$ when obtaining near-optimal policies and V-value functions. Both $\textbf{QVI-1}$ and $\textbf{QVI-2}$ achieve quantum query complexities that provably improve upon classical lower bounds, particularly in their dependences on $S$ and $A$. (2) In the generative model setting, where samples from the environment are accessible in quantum superposition, we prove that our algorithms $\textbf{QVI-3}$ and $\textbf{QVI-4}$ achieve improvements in sample complexity over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical algorithm in terms of $A$, estimation error $(\epsilon)$, and time horizon $(H)$. More importantly, we prove quantum lower bounds to show that $\textbf{QVI-3}$ and $\textbf{QVI-4}$ are asymptotically optimal, up to logarithmic factors, assuming a constant time horizon.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reservoir GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is known as one of the promising applications of quantum computers. Many types of quantum machine learning methods have been released, such as Quantum Annealer, Quantum Neural Network, Variational Quantum Algorithms, and Quantum Reservoir Computers. They can work consuming far less energy for networks of equivalent size. Quantum Reservoir Computers, in particular, have no limit on the size of input data. However, their accuracy is not enough for practical use, and the effort to improve accuracy is mainly focused on hardware improvements. Therefore, we propose the approach from software called Quantum Reservoir Generative Adversarial Network ( GAN ), which uses Quantum Reservoir Computers as a generator of GAN. We performed the generation of handwritten single digits and monochrome pictures on the CIFAR10 dataset. As a result, Quantum Reservoir GAN is confirmed to be more accurate than Quantum GAN, Classical Neural Network, and ordinary Quantum Reservoir Computers.</description>

      <title>The vast world of quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to identify quantum advantages lies at the heart of quantum technology. While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision, distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation, learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties: predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee. While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.</description>

      <title>Role of Plaquette Term in Genuine $2+1$D String Dynamics on Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.</description>

      <title>A quantum computing approach to efficiently simulating correlated materials using impurity models and dynamical mean field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.</description>

      <title>Classical simulation of noisy quantum circuits via locally entanglement-optimal unravelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulations of noisy quantum circuits is instrumental to our understanding of the behavior of real world quantum systems and the identification of regimes where one expects quantum advantage. In this work, we present a highly parallelizable tensor-network-based classical algorithm -- equipped with rigorous accuracy guarantees -- for simulating $n$-qubit quantum circuits with arbitrary single-qubit noise. Our algorithm represents the state of a noisy quantum system by a particular ensemble of matrix product states from which we stochastically sample. Each single qubit noise process acting on a pure state is then represented by the ensemble of states that achieve the minimal average entanglement (the entanglement of formation) between the noisy qubit and the remainder. This approach lets us use a more compact representation of the quantum state for a given accuracy requirement and noise level. For a given maximum bond dimension $\chi$ and circuit, our algorithm comes with an upper bound on the simulation error, runs in poly$(n,\chi)$-time and improves upon related prior work (1) in scope: by extending from the three commonly considered noise models to general single qubit noise (2) in performance: by employing a state-dependent locally-entanglement-optimal unraveling and (3) in conceptual contribution: by showing that the fixed unraveling used in prior work becomes equivalent to our choice of unraveling in the special case of depolarizing and dephasing noise acting on a maximally entangled state.</description>

      <title>Expressivity Limits and Trainability Guarantees in Quantum Walk-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have emerged as a promising tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The quantum walk optimization algorithm (QWOA) is one such variational approach that has recently gained attention. In the broader context of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), understanding the expressivity and trainability of the ansatz has proven critical for evaluating their performance. A key method to study both these aspects involves analyzing the dimension of the dynamic Lie algebra (DLA). In this work, we derive novel upper bounds on the DLA dimension for QWOA applied to arbitrary optimization problems. The consequence of our result is twofold: (a) it allows us to identify complexity-theoretic conditions under which QWOA must be overparameterized to obtain optimal or approximate solutions, and (b) it implies the absence of barren plateaus in the loss landscape of QWOA for $\mathsf{NP}$ optimization problems with polynomially bounded cost functions ($\mathsf{NPO}\text{-}\mathsf{PB}$).</description>

      <title>Generalized Holstein-Primakoff mapping and $1/N$ expansion of collective spin systems undergoing single particle dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generalization of the Schwinger boson and Holstein-Primakoff transformations that is applicable to ensembles of $N$ spin $1/2$'s with weak permutational symmetry. These generalized mappings are constructed by introducing two independent bosonic variables that describe fluctuations parallel and transverse to the collective Bloch vector built out of the original spin $1/2$'s. Using this representation, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion and write down explicitly leading and next-to-leading order terms. We then illustrate how to apply these techniques using four example systems: (i) an ensemble of atoms undergoing spontaneous emission, incoherent pumping and single particle dephasing; (ii) a superradiant laser above and in the vicinity of the upper lasing transition; (iii) the all-to-all transverse field Ising model subject to incoherent pumping in the vicinity of its ordering phase transition; and (iv) the Dicke model at finite temperature both away and in the vicinity of its thermal phase transition. Thus, these mappings provide a common, Bloch-sphere based, geometrical description of all-to-all systems subject to single particle dissipation or at finite temperature, including their phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum computers with any quantum algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application-based benchmarks are increasingly used to quantify and compare quantum computers' performance. However, because contemporary quantum computers cannot run utility-scale computations, these benchmarks currently test this hardware's performance on ``small'' problem instances that are not necessarily representative of utility-scale problems. Furthermore, these benchmarks often employ methods that are unscalable, limiting their ability to track progress towards utility-scale applications. In this work, we present a method for creating scalable and efficient benchmarks from any quantum algorithm or application. Our subcircuit volumetric benchmarking (SVB) method runs subcircuits of varied shape that are ``snipped out'' from some target circuit, which could implement a utility-scale algorithm. SVB is scalable and it enables estimating a capability coefficient that concisely summarizes progress towards implementing the target circuit. We demonstrate SVB with experiments on IBM Q systems using a Hamiltonian block-encoding subroutine from quantum chemistry algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modular Quantum Amplitude Estimation: A Scalable and Adaptive Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) is a key primitive in quantum computing, but its standard implementation using Quantum Phase Estimation is resource-intensive, requiring a large number of coherent qubits in a single circuit block to achieve high precision. This presents a significant challenge for near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Amplitude Estimation (AWQAE) framework, a modular, scalable and adaptive approach that decouples estimation precision from the number of physical qubits required in a single circuit. AWQAE operates by iteratively estimating the phase bits in small, fixed-size chunks, using a number of smaller, independent quantum circuits, which are amenable to parallel processing. A key technical contribution of this work is introduction of a phase resolution circuit and an ancilla-guided mechanism that enables accurate chunk assignment and eigenphase reconstruction in the presence of multiple eigenstates. This design is inherently NISQ-friendly, by lowering circuit depth and qubit count per block to reduce decoherence and noise effects. A key component of our approach is a robust classical post-processing algorithm that resolves measurement ambiguities that arise during the iterative process. This post-processing routine uses a least-significant-bit (LSB)-to-most-significant-bit (MSB) correction to reconstruct the full, high-precision phase estimate, ensuring accuracy. By combining a modular quantum-classical loop with an ambiguity-aware reconstruction method, AWQAE offers a powerful and flexible solution for performing high-precision QAE on resource-constrained quantum hardware. Our approach demonstrates enhanced scalability, and adaptability, making it a promising candidate for practical applications of QAE in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Zeta-Regularisation of Feynman Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feynman Propagator of a charged particle confined to an anisotropic Harmonic Oscillator potential and moving in a crossed electromagnetic field is calculated in a conceptually new way. The calculation is based on the expansion of the path variable into a complex Fourier series. The path integral then becomes an infinite product of Gaussian integrals. This product is divergent. It turns out that we can regularize this product by using the zeta-function. It is a remarkable fact that the zeta-function is so well suited as a regularizator for divergent path integrals.</description>

      <title>Tailored First-order and Interior-point methods and a new semidefinite programming hierarchy for entanglement detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information science, yet its reliable detection in high-dimensional or noisy systems remains a fundamental computational challenge. Semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies, such as the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) and Extension (EXT) hierarchies, offer complete methods for entanglement detection, but their practical use is limited by exponential growth in problem size. In this paper, we introduce a new SDP hierarchy, PST, that is sandwiched between EXT and DPS--offering a tighter approximation to the set of separable states than EXT, while incurring lower computational overhead than DPS.
  We develop compact, polynomially-scalable descriptions of EXT and PST using partition mappings and operators. These descriptions in turn yield formulations that satisfy desirable properties such as the Slater condition and are well-suited to both first-order methods (FOMs) and interior-point methods (IPMs). We design a suite of entanglement detection algorithms: three FOMs (Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient, and fast projected gradient) based on a least-squares formulation, and a custom primal-dual IPM based on a conic programming formulation. These methods are numerically stable and capable of producing entanglement witnesses or proximity measures, even in cases where states lie near the boundary of separability.
  Numerical experiments on benchmark quantum states demonstrate that our algorithms improve the ability to solve deeper levels of the SDP hierarchy. In particular, the PST hierarchy combined with FOMs enables scalable and effective entanglement detection in relatively easy instances, while our IPM approach offers robustness and early witness recovery for the more difficult ones. Our results highlight the benefits of tailoring algorithmic formulations to hierarchy structure to advance entanglement detection at scale.</description>

Abstract: We present the MPS-JuliQAOA simulator, a user-friendly, open-source tool to simulate the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) of any optimization problem that can be expressed as diagonal Hamiltonian. By leveraging Julia-language constructs and the ITensor package to implement a Matrix Product State (MPS) approach to simulating QAOA, MPS-Juli-QAOA effortlessly scales to 512 qubits and 20 simulation rounds on the standard de-facto benchmark 3-regular MaxCut QAOA problem. MPS-JuliQAOA also has built-in parameter finding capabilities, which is a crucial performance aspect of QAOA. We illustrate through examples that the user does not need to know MPS principles or complex automatic differentiation techniques to use MPS-JuliQAOA. We study the scalability of our tool with respect to runtime, memory usage and accuracy tradeoffs. Code available at https://github.com/lanl/JuliQAOA.jl/tree/mps.</description>

      <title>A spin-embedded diamond optomechanical resonator with mechanical quality factor exceeding one million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>State-adaptive quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for state-adaptive quantum error correction (SAQEC) that bridges the gap between quantum computing and error correction paradigms. By incorporating knowledge of quantum states into the error correction process, we establish a new capacity regime governed by quantum mutual information rather than coherent information. This approach reveals a fundamental connection to entanglement-assisted protocols. We demonstrate practical applications in fault-tolerant quantum computation, showing how state-adaptivity enables enhanced error correction without additional measurement overhead. The framework provides new insights into quantum channel capacities while offering implementation advantages for current quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Federated Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-term Memory for Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Federated Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-term Memory (Fed-QK-LSTM) framework, integrating the quantum kernel methods and Long Short-term Memory into federated learning. Within Fed-QK-LSTM framework, we enhance human activity recognition (HAR) in privacy-sensitive environments and leverage quantum computing for distributed learning systems. The DeepConv-QK-LSTM architecture on each client node employs convolutional layers for efficient local pattern capture, this design enables the use of a shallow QK-LSTM to model long-range relationships within the HAR data. The quantum kernel method enables the model to capture complex non-linear relationships in multivariate time-series data with fewer trainable parameters. Experimental results on RealWorld HAR dataset demonstrate that Fed-QK-LSTM framework achieves competitive accuracy across different client settings and local training rounds. We showcase the potential of Fed-QK-LSTM framework for robust and privacy-preserving human activity recognition in real-world applications, especially in edge computing environments and on scarce quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Near-Heisenberg-limited parallel amplitude estimation with logarithmic depth circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum amplitude estimation is one of the core subroutines in quantum algorithms. This paper gives a parallelized amplitude estimation (PAE) algorithm, that simultaneously achieves near-Heisenberg scaling in the total number of queries and sub-linear scaling in the circuit depth, with respect to the estimation precision. The algorithm is composed of a global GHZ state followed by separated low-depth Grover circuits; the number of qubits in the GHZ state and the depth of each circuit is tunable as a trade-off way, which particularly enables even near-Heisenberg-limited and logarithmic-depth algorithm for amplitude estimation. The quantum signal processing technique is effectively used to build the algorithm. The proposed algorithm has a form of distributed quantum computing, which may be suitable for device implementation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization on Rydberg Atom Arrays with Arbitrary Connectivity: Gadgets Limitations and a Heuristic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable quantum systems based on Rydberg atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising testbed for combinatorial optimization. Indeed, the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem on unit-disk graphs can be efficiently mapped to such systems due to their geometric constraints. However, extending this capability to arbitrary graph instances typically necessitates the use of reduction gadgets, which introduce additional experimental overhead and complexity. Here, we analyze the complexity-theoretic limits of polynomial reductions from arbitrary graphs to unit-disk instances. We prove any such reduction incurs a quadratic blow-up in vertex count and degrades solution approximation guarantees. As a practical alternative, we propose a divide-and-conquer heuristic with only linear overhead which leverages precalibrated atomic layouts. We benchmark it on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, and demonstrate feasibility on the Orion Alpha processor.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Scalability of Classical Surrogates for Real-World Quantum Machine Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) presents potential for early industrial adoption, yet limited access to quantum hardware remains a significant bottleneck for deployment of QML solutions. This work explores the use of classical surrogates to bypass this restriction, which is a technique that allows to build a lightweight classical representation of a (trained) quantum model, enabling to perform inference on entirely classical devices. We reveal prohibiting high computational demand associated with previously proposed methods for generating classical surrogates from quantum models, and propose an alternative pipeline enabling generation of classical surrogates at a larger scale than was previously possible. Previous methods required at least a high-performance computing (HPC) system for quantum models of below industrial scale (ca. 20 qubits), which raises questions about its practicality. We greatly minimize the redundancies of the previous approach, utilizing only a minute fraction of the resources previously needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real-world energy demand forecasting problem, conducting rigorous testing of performance and computation demand in both simulations and on quantum hardware. Our results indicate that our method achieves high accuracy on the testing dataset while its computational resource requirements scale linearly rather than exponentially. This work presents a lightweight approach to transform quantum solutions into classically deployable versions, facilitating faster integration of quantum technology in industrial settings. Furthermore, it can serve as a powerful research tool in search practical quantum advantage in an empirical setup.</description>

      <title>Diagonalizing large-scale quantum many-body Hamiltonians using variational quantum circuit and tensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is an essential tool for exploring quantum many-body physics but is fundamentally limited by the exponentially-scaled computational complexity. Here, we propose tensor network variational diagonalization (TNVD), which encodes the full eigenenergy spectrum of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian into a matrix product state, and encodes the eigenstates as the evolutions of product states using variational quantum circuit (VQC). Thereby, TNVD reduces the computational complexity of diagonalization from exponential to polynomial in system size $N$. Numerical benchmarks up to $N=100$ spins are provided, which far surpass the computational limit of ED. We further consider quantum Ising model in a random field to reveal the underlying reliance between the efficiency of TNVD and entanglement properties of eigenstates. Typical signs, including the distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) versus eigenenergy and the density of state versus EE, are suggested to indicate area law of entanglement entropy or its violation, which are essential to the TNVD efficiency. Our work establishes TNVD as a powerful and scalable diagonalization approach for large-scale quantum many-body Hamiltonians. The incorporation of VQC lays a promising pathway to applying quantum computation to address the volume-law-EE Hamiltonians that lack efficient classical approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \texttt{lcg\_plus}, an open-source Python library for the simulation of continuous-variable quantum circuits with both generaldyne and photon-number-resolving detector capabilities. Our framework merges the linear combination of Gaussians methodology with the coherent state decomposition of arbitrary non-Gaussian states, forming a bridge between the Gaussian and Fock basis representations. By tracking the Wigner function, we can simulate the action of Gaussian channels and measurements on multi-mode systems in a fast and accurate numerical framework. The calculation of the quality measures of quantum states is convenient in this formalism, and we derive expressions for the analytical gradients of these measures with respect to parameterized circuit elements. We demonstrate the utility of this methodology by optimizing the heralded preparation of a qunaught state, a crucial component for building a fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer, with a Gaussian Boson sampling circuit containing inefficient components.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum State Preparation for Encoding Genomic Data with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing hardware advances, the need for algorithms that facilitate the loading of classical data into the quantum states of these devices has become increasingly important. This study presents a method for producing scalable quantum circuits to encode genomic data using the Matrix Product State (MPS) formalism. The method is illustrated by encoding the genome of the bacteriophage $\Phi X174$ into a 15-qubit state, and analysing the trade-offs between MPS bond dimension, reconstruction error, and the resulting circuit complexity. This study proposes methods for optimising encoding circuits with standard benchmark datasets for the emerging field of quantum bioinformatics. The results for circuit generation and simulation on HPC and on current quantum hardware demonstrate the viability and utility of the encoding.</description>

      <title>The loss tolerance of cat breeding for fault-tolerant grid state generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a continuous-variable photonic quantum computer depends on the reliable preparation of high-quality Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states. The most promising GKP preparation scheme is the cat breeding protocol, which can generate GKP states deterministically given a source of squeezed cat states, using beam splitters, homodyne detectors and a feedforward displacement. However, analyzing the performance of the protocol under loss is cumbersome due to the exponential scaling of the system. By representing the Wigner function of the input states as a linear combination of Gaussians, we are able to quickly and accurately simulate several rounds of breeding with mixed input states. Using this novel method, we find that optical loss decreases the overall success probability of the protocol, and prohibits the preparation of a fault-tolerant GKP state when the loss exceeds 4\%. Our methodology is available as open-source code.</description>

      <title>Detecting entanglement between quantum emitters using directional emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that quantum interference in a system containing a polarized and unpolarized emitter can allow directional emission of photons into a circulating cavity. Here, we ask whether high directionality of photon emission in this system implies a high degree of quantum correlation between the two emitters. We show that the answer is a qualified "yes", with photon emission directionality and emitter-emitter entanglement showing a monotonic relationship over a broad parameter range. The relationship only breaks down in the limit of perfect directionality. Furthermore, under reasonable assumptions for experimental parameters and stability, we show that the statistics of measured directionality allow a reliable estimate of the concurrence. This result implies that directionality of photon emission in the state preparation stage can be used to determine the entanglement between the emitters, with potential applications to more generic cases including quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Aspheric lens design proposal for near-perfect mode-matching of a broadband quantum dot micropillar to a single-mode fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots in micropillars are one of the most promising options for a bright, deterministic single photon source. While highly efficient devices (&gt;95%) have been designed, there remains a significant bottleneck that impacts the overall system efficiency: the large numerical aperture of the output mode. This leads to inefficient coupling of emitted photons into single-mode fibre, thus limiting practical integration into quantum computing and communication architectures. We show that with the addition of a well designed aspheric SiO2 microlens we can decrease the mode-matching losses to a SMF from 83.1% to &lt;0.1(0.1)%. This can result in a single photon source design with 96.4(0.1)% end-to-end efficiency, paving the way for scalable photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Space and Time Cost of Continuous Rotations in Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Clifford operations are relatively easy to implement in fault-tolerant quantum computers,continuous rotation gates remain a significant bottleneck in typical quantum algorithms. In this work, we ask the question: "What is the most efficient approach for implementing continuous rotations in a surface code architecture?" Several techniques have been developed to reduce the T-count or T-depth of rotations, such as Hamming weight phasing and catalyst towers. However, these methods often require additional a number of ancilla qubits, and thus the ultimate cost function one needs to optimise against should rather be the total runtime or the total space required for performing a rotation. We explicitly construct surface code layouts for catalyst towers in two practical application examples in the context of option pricing: (a) implementing a phase oracle circuit, which is a ubiquitous subroutine in many quantum algorithms, and (b) state preparation using a variational quantum circuit. Our analysis shows that, at small and medium code distances, catalyst towers not only reduce the runtime but can also decrease the total spacetime volume of rotations. However, at large code distances, conventional Clifford+T synthesis may prove more efficient. Additionally, we note that our conclusions are sensitive to specific application scenarios and the choices of various parameters. Nevertheless, catalyst towers may be particularly advantageous for early fault-tolerant quantum applications, where low and medium code distances are assumed and a spacetime tradeoff is needed to reduce the runtime of individual circuit runs, such as in scenarios involving high circuit repetition counts.</description>

      <title>Supercoherence: Harnessing Long-Range Interactions to Preserve Collective Coherence in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial quantum systems with synthetic dimensions enable exploring novel quantum phenomena difficult to create in conventional materials. These synthetic degrees of freedom increase the system's dimensionality without altering its physical structure, accessing higher-dimensional physics in lower-dimensional setups. However, synthetic quantum systems often suffer from intrinsic disorder, causing rapid decoherence that limits scalability, a major obstacle in quantum information science. Here, we show that introducing just a few long-range interactions can mitigate decoherence, creating persistent collective coherence in highly symmetric collective excited states. We term this universal phenomenon "supercoherence" and show its exceptional robustness against disorder up to a dynamical phase transition at critical interaction strength and disorder. Supercoherence stabilizes not only coherence but also all other quantum properties of the states, challenging traditional views on the inevitability of decoherence in disordered interacting quantum systems and suggesting new opportunities for quantum memory and information processing.</description>

      <title>Cavity-based optical switching via phase modulation in warm rubidium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06255v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical switching remains a key outstanding challenge for scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing due to the trade-off between speed, bandwidth, and loss. Scalable quantum photonics demands all three, to enable high computational clock rates and resource efficient scaling to large systems. We present a cavity-based optical switch that overcomes this limitation, demonstrating 22 ns rise time, insertion loss of 2.4 dB, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio. All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.</description>

      <title>Secure Hybrid Key Growing via Coherence Witnessing and Bipartite Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Hybrid Key Growing (HKG) protocol based on quantum principles and a classical physical-layer assumption. We simultaneously exploit the quantum photon-number and photon-time-bin Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), effectively doubling the bit-per-pulse rate compared to conventional Quantum Key Growing (QKG) schemes. Our protocol integrates entity authentication, and is designed for practical implementation by avoiding reliance on single-photon sources or detectors. By incorporating prior knowledge about the quantum channel, the scheme actively mitigates noise effects, making it suitable for real-world conditions. Under certain assumptions on experimental efficiencies, our approach also promises an increased key generation rate in bits per second. Our simulation results display, first, expected outcomes to gain assurance about the correctness of our implementation and, second, relevant dependencies that showcase desirable properties of our scheme in regimes of low photon loss and dephasing. In particular, within such regimes, our encoding scheme reduces the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) while preserving the ability to detect eavesdropping and identity-forgery attempts.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity with a quantum control field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic dynamics is the crucial element of adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity enable acceleration of the computational time by suppressing unwanted non-adiabatic processes with designed classical fields. Here, we consider quantum state transfer in the Landau-Zener model, which exemplifies the key elements of quantum adiabatic dynamics. We argue that non-adiabatic transitions can be suppressed by autonomous quantum dynamics, which involves coupling the Landau-Zener qubit to a second quantum system. By tuning the coupling strength, the composite quantum dynamics can reduce the probability of unwanted processes by more than two orders of magnitude. This is a prime example of control where the quantum properties of the control fields are key for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily-high-dimensional reconciliation via cross-rotation for continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional rotation serves as a powerful tool for enhancing information reconciliation and extending the transmission distance in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, the lack of closed-form orthogonal transformations for high-dimensional rotations has limited the maximum reconciliation efficiency to channels with 8 dimensions over the past decade. This paper presents a cross-rotation scheme to overcome this limitation and enable reconciliation in arbitrarily high dimensions, constrained to even multiples of 8. The key treatment involves reshaping the string vector into matrix form and applying orthogonal transformations to its columns and rows in a cross manner, thereby increasing the reconciliation dimension by one order per cross-rotation while significantly reducing the communication overhead over the classical channel. A rigorous performance analysis is also presented from the perspective of achievable sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that 64-dimensional cross-rotation nearly approaches the upper bound, making it a recommended choice for practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Intrinsic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional datasets typically cluster around lower-dimensional manifolds but are also often marred by severe noise, obscuring the intrinsic geometry essential for downstream learning tasks. We present a quantum algorithm for estimating the intrinsic geometry of a point cloud -- specifically its local intrinsic dimension and local scalar curvature. These quantities are crucial for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and anomaly detection -- tasks that are central to a wide range of data-driven and data-assisted applications. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm which takes a dataset with pairwise geometric distance, output the estimation of local dimension and curvature at a given point. We demonstrate that this quantum algorithm achieves an exponential speedup over its classical counterpart, and, as a corollary, further extend our main technique to diffusion maps, yielding exponential improvements even over existing quantum algorithms. Our work marks another step toward efficient quantum applications in geometrical data analysis, moving beyond topological summaries toward precise geometric inference and opening a novel, scalable path to quantum-enhanced manifold learning.</description>

      <title>The Dual Role of Low-Weight Pauli Propagation: A Flawed Simulator but a Powerful Initializer for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) rely on a classical optimizer to tune a parameterized quantum circuit, raising the question of whether classical methods can assist in this process. In this work, we investigate the low-weight Pauli propagation (LWPP) algorithm as a potential classical tool for simulating the VQA circuit. We first find that LWPP is an unreliable estimator of the true energy, limiting its utility as a direct simulator. However, we uncover its real value: despite this numerical inaccuracy, its approximate optimization landscape robustly guides parameters toward high-quality basins of attraction. We therefore propose harnessing LWPP not for simulation, but as a classical pre-optimizer to find superior initial parameters for the main VQA loop. Benchmarking this strategy on Heisenberg models, we demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in both the final accuracy and convergence rate, typically by an order of magnitude, over standard heuristics. Our work thus reframes LWPP from a flawed simulator into a powerful classical pre-processor that effectively mitigates the notorious optimization challenges in VQAs and reduces the computational burden on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>SQUID G.A.M.E.: Gamma, Atmospheric, and Mono-Energetic Neutron Effects on Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum devices are a promising solution to many research applications, including medical imaging, precision magnetic field measurements, condensed matter physics, and overcoming the limits of classical computing. Among the available implementations, the superconducting technology is the current focus of scientific research and industrial applications, excelling in performance and scalability. Despite this, superconducting quantum systems are extremely prone to decoherence, and in particular, they are highly sensitive to radiation events. In this paper, we analyze the response of a superconducting device (SQUID) to radiation. We expose the SQUID to beams of monoenergetic 14 MeV neutrons (NILE - ISIS), atmospheric 1-800 MeV neutrons (ChipIR - ISIS), and gamma rays with 1.25 MeV average energy (CALLIOPE - ENEA). These experiments show that the SQUID is sensitive to the two neutron fields, while gamma rays at 1.25 MeV leave it mostly unaffected. Following our experiments with neutrons, it is possible to characterize the SQUID's response and even classify faults according to their shape and duration. We identify two categories: bursts (long lasting) and peaks (short lived). To investigate the different responses to neutrons and gamma rays, we employ Geant4 simulations, which highlight differences in the deposition spectra and the energy propagation, but likewise predict the vulnerability of the SQUID in both cases.</description>

      <title>Design and analysis of a set of discrete variable protocols for secure quantum communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of quantum key distribution (QKD) has revolutionized secure communication by providing unconditional security, unlike classical cryptographic methods. However, its effectiveness relies on robust identity authentication, as vulnerabilities in the authentication process can cause a compromise with the security of the entire communication system. Over the past three decades, numerous quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols have been proposed. This thesis first presents a chronological review of these protocols, categorizing them based on quantum resources and computational tasks involved while analyzing their strengths and limitations. Subsequently, by recognizing inherent symmetries present in the existing protocols, we design novel QIA schemes based on secure computational and communication tasks. Specifically, this work introduces a set of new QIA protocols that utilize controlled secure direct quantum communication. The proposed scheme facilitates mutual authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, with assistance from a third party, Charlie, using Bell states. A comprehensive security analysis demonstrates its robustness against impersonation, intercept-resend, and fraudulent authentication attacks. The comparative evaluation highlights its advantages over existing schemes. Additionally, this thesis presents two novel QKD protocols that eliminate the need for entanglement or ideal single-photon sources, making them feasible with commercially available photon sources. These protocols are rigorously proven to be secure against various attacks, including intercept-resend and certain collective attacks. Key rate bounds are established, demonstrating that specific classical pre-processing enhances the tolerable error threshold. PHD THESIS</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Quasi-Stationary State (QSS) in the context of quantum Markov semigroups that generalizes the one of quasi-stationary distribution in the case of classical Markov chains. We provide an operational interpretation of QSSs using the theory of direct and indirect quantum measurements. Moreover, we prove that there is a connection between QSSs and spectral properties of the quantum Markov semigroup. Finally, we discuss some examples which, despite their simplicity, already show interesting features.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for the Set Splitting Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a novel use of quantum annealing to solve the Set Splitting Problem using (QUBO) problem formulation. The contribution of the work is in formulating penalty functions that ensure the ground state of the QUBO Hamiltonian corresponds to valid solutions that split the input subsets. This approach scales linearly in terms of the number of logical qubits relative to problem size. Empirical tests of the proposed solution show convergence to globally optimal solutions, with high accuracy rates over repeated trials. Hardware limitations of current quantum annealers lead to an exponential rise in required physical qubits, versus the theoretical linear increase, although this can improve with future developments. Further work is needed to enhance formulation robustness, reduce qubit requirements for embedded problems, and to conduct more extensive bench-marking. Quantum solutions to the Set-Splitting problem lead to reduced time complexity versus classical solutions, and may accelerate research in biology, cybersecurity, and other domains.</description>

      <title>Single photon emission from lithographically-positioned engineered nanodiamonds for cryogenic applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centres in nanodiamonds (NDs) provide a promising resource for quantum photonic systems. However, developing a technology beyond proof-of-principle physics requires optimally engineering its component parts. In this work, we present a hybrid materials platform by photolithographically positioning ball-milled isotopically-enriched NDs on broadband metal reflectors. The structure enhances the photonic collection efficiency, enabling cryogenic characterisation despite the limited numerical aperture imposed by our cryostat. Our device, with SiO$_2$ above a silver reflector, allows us to perform spectroscopic characterisation at 16 K and measure autocorrelation functions confirming single-photon emission (g$^2$(0)&lt;0.5). Through comparative studies of similar hybrid device configurations, we can move towards optimally engineered techniques for building and analysing quantum emitters in wafer-scale photonic environments.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Learning Non-Gaussian Quantum States of Continuous Variable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum systems are foundational to quantum computation, communication, and sensing. While traditional representations using wave functions or density matrices are often impractical, the tomographic picture of quantum mechanics provides an accessible alternative by associating quantum states with classical probability distribution functions called tomograms. Despite its advantages, including compatibility with classical statistical methods, tomographic method remain underutilized due to a lack of robust estimation techniques. This work addresses this gap by introducing a non-parametric \emph{kernel quantum state estimation} (KQSE) framework for reconstructing quantum states and their trace characteristics from noisy data, without prior knowledge of the state. In contrast to existing methods, KQSE yields estimates of the density matrix in various bases, as well as trace quantities such as purity, higher moments, overlap, and trace distance, with a near-optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{O}\bigl(T^{-1}\bigr)$, where $T$ is the total number of measurements. KQSE is robust for multimodal, non-Gaussian states, making it particularly well suited for characterizing states essential for quantum science.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations with Set-Equivariant Architectures and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) ans\"atze have greatly expanded the accuracy and reach of variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, in particular when exploring the manifold quantum phenomena exhibited by spin systems. However, the scalability of QMC is still compromised by several other bottlenecks, and specifically those related to the actual evaluation of observables based on random deviates that lies at the core of the approach. Here we show how the set-transformer architecture can be used to dramatically accelerate or even bypass that step, especially for time-consuming operators such as powers of the magnetization. We illustrate the procedure with a range of examples of increasing complexity, from the classical Ising model to quantum systems with long-range interactions, and comprising both regressions (to predict observables) and classifications (to detect phase transitions). Moreover, we show how transfer learning can be leveraged to reduce the training cost by reusing knowledge from different systems and smaller system sizes.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal and Geometric Frustration in Dissipative Quantum Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions often create conflicting dynamical objectives that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, leading to nonreciprocal frustration. On the other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives in energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that nonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a damped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to nonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness against disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for steady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a fine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium case. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition driven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a time-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by the geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete symmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple harmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down. Our predictions have important physical implications for a three-component spinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the structural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated self-organized BECs. We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental observation despite the presence of disorder in the spin-cavity coupling strengths.</description>

Abstract: The simulation of the spectra measured in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments is a computationally non-trivial problem, and as such, it represents a problem for which a quantum computer may provide some practical advantage over traditional computing methods. In order to understand the extent to which such problems may provide examples of useful quantum advantage, it is important to understand the limitations of existing classical simulation methods. In this work, we benchmark our classical solver designed to solve such problems. We find that it performs well, even beyond the common experimental parameter regimes, except for a specific molecule with certain unusual features. We discuss what implications this may have for future efforts to demonstrate quantum advantage in the context of NMR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T center defects in silicon provide an attractive platform for quantum technologies due to their unique spin properties and compatibility with mature silicon technologies. We investigate several gate protocols between single T centers, including two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic dipole-based scheme. In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections. We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future experimental capabilities. In particular, we find that the photon interference-based scheme with feedback has the potential to achieve competitive efficiency and fidelity, making it interesting to explore experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators offer a promising approach to the exploration of strongly interacting many-body systems, with applications spanning condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. Through a combination of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>ConiQ: Enabling Concatenated Quantum Error Correction on Neutral Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress on concatenated codes, especially many-hypercube codes, achieves unprecedented space efficiency. Yet two critical challenges persist in practice. First, these codes lack efficient implementations of addressable logical gates. Second, the required high degree of parallelism and long-range interactions pose significant challenges for current hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose an efficient compilation approach for concatenated codes, specifically many-hypercube codes, targeted at neutral atom arrays, which provide the necessary parallelism and long-range interactions. Our approach builds on two key innovations. First, we introduce Automorphism-assisted Hierarchical Addressing (AHA) logical CNOT gates that significantly reduce spacetime overhead compared to conventional distillation-based methods. Second, we develop Virtual Atom Intermediate Representation (VAIR) that enables level-wise optimization and legalization. We implement these innovations in ConiQ, a hardware-aware quantum compiler designed to compile fault-tolerant quantum circuits for neutral atom arrays using many-hypercube codes. Our evaluation demonstrates that ConiQ achieves up to 2000x reduction in spacetime overhead and up to 10^6x reduction in compilation time compared to state-of-the-art compilers, with our AHA gates providing an additional overhead reduction of up to 20x. These results establish concatenated codes as a promising approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing in the near future.</description>

      <title>Basic interactive algorithms: Preview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dialog paper offers a preview and provides a foretaste of an upcoming work on the axiomatization of basic interactive algorithms.
  The modern notion of algorithm was elucidated in the 1930s--1950s. It was axiomatized a quarter of a century ago as the notion of ``sequential algorithm'' or ``classical algorithm''; we prefer to call it ``basic algorithm" now. The axiomatization was used to show that for every basic algorithm there is a behaviorally equivalent abstract state machine. It was also used to prove the Church-Turing thesis as it has been understood by the logicians.
  Starting from the 1960s, the notion of algorithm has expanded -- probabilistic algorithms, quantum algorithms, etc. -- prompting introduction of a much more ambitious version of the Church-Turing thesis commonly known as the ``physical thesis.'' We emphasize the difference between the two versions of the Church-Turing thesis and illustrate how nondeterministic and probabilistic algorithms can be viewed as basic algorithms with appropriate oracles. The same view applies to quantum circuit algorithms and many other classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>

      <title>A spacetime-covariant approach to inertial and accelerated quantum clocks in first-quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the (quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii) charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix $\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum fluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.</description>

      <title>Emulating isomerization with two-dimensional Coulomb crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomerization, i.e. the rearrangement between distinct molecular configurations, is a fundamental process in chemistry. Here we demonstrate that two-dimensional Coulomb crystals can emulate molecular isomerization and be used to characterize its physical mechanisms. In our molecular analogue, the confining potential acts as an electronic orbital, which can be tuned continuously and dynamically. We use a planar crystal of six 138Ba+ ions, which exhibits two stable configurations depending on the aspect ratio of the harmonic trapping potential. By changing this aspect ratio, we directly modify the potential energy surface (PES) of the ion crystal, and trigger isomerization in a controlled way. We identify a region of bistability between the two isomers, and use configuration-resolved imaging to detect isomerization in real time. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the double well PES. By comparing simulated transition rates with experimental population ratios, we estimate the crystal's temperature. Additionally, we prepare metastable configurations by rapidly quenching the PES, and detect isomerization dynamics with sub-millisecond resolution. Our work establishes a new platform for emulating molecular processes, paving the way for studying quantum superpositions of crystal configurations, and for controlling isomeric excitations in two-dimensional Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-quality photon pair generation in modal phase-matched thin-film lithium niobate micro-ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient generation of high-quality photon pairs is essential for modern quantum technologies. Micro-ring resonator is an ideal platform for studying on-chip photon sources due to strong nonlinear effect, resonant-enhanced optical fields, and high integration. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) micro-ring resonators with periodically poled quasi-phase matching have shown high-quality photon pair generation. However, periodic poling technology remains expensive and requires complex fabrication hindering its scalability and capability for practical application in nonlinear photonic devices. To address this, we propose a scalable approach using TFLN micro-ring resonators based on modal phase matching to achieve cost-effective, efficient high-quality photon-pair generation, significantly simplifying fabrication. We achieved pair generation rates up to 40.2 MHz/mW through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, with coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 1200. By combining micro-ring resonance enhancement with modal phase matching, our approach reduces device size and fabrication cost while maintaining high nonlinear efficiency. These results advance the development of compact, efficient on-chip photon sources for next-generation nonlinear and quantum photonic applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce entropic measures to quantify non-classical resource in hybrid spin-boson systems. We discuss the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in the framework of phase space quantisation and define an analogous hybrid magic entropy and a mutual magic entropy that capture the distribution of quantum magic across spin and bosonic subsystems. We use these entropic measures to demonstrate two key phenomena: the detection of the superradiant phase transition in the Dicke model and the dynamics of magic in the Jaynes-Cummings model following a quench. We develop a Monte Carlo numerical scheme to enable practical computation in many-body examples.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation and Differential Privacy using Tensor Networks' Matrix Product States (MPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of non-zero magnetization on the ground-state phase diagram of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Employing a mean-field theoretical framework, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate that positions and sizes of specific phases on the diagram are magnetization dependent. In particular, non-zero magnetization introduces different Mott insulator phase boundaries for each of the two components. This effect leads to the emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid in one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings highlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization here, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability and emergence of distinct quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator with photonic quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts. Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the non-Abelian topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We spectroscopically study mobile impurities immersed in a homogeneous bosonic bath (a box-trapped Bose gas), varying the bath temperature and the strength of impurity-bath interactions. We compare our results to those for a quasipure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and find that for strong impurity-bath interactions, the spectra narrow with increasing temperature, while the impurity energy shift is suppressed. Near the critical temperature for condensation, many-body effects still play an important role, and only for a nondegenerate bath, the system approaches the classical Boltzmann-gas behavior. The key spectral features are reproduced within the theory of an ideal Bose polaron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present verification protocols to gain confidence in the correct performance of the realization of an arbitrary universal quantum computation. The derivation of the protocols is based on the fact that matchgate computations, which are classically efficiently simulable, become universal if supplemented with additional resources. We combine tools from weak simulation, randomized compiling, and classical statistics to derive verification circuits. These circuits have the property that (i) they strongly resemble the original circuit and (ii) cannot only be classically efficiently simulated in the ideal, i.e. error free, scenario, but also in the realistic situation where errors are present. In fact, in one of the protocols we apply exactly the same circuit as in the original computation, however, to a slightly modified input state.</description>

Abstract: We propose a device consisting of $m$ Mach-Zehnder interferometers and realizing sorting of first $2^m$ temporal Hermite-Gauss modes of light passing though it by adjusting the accumulated temporal Gouy phase acquired by every mode. This mode-order-dependent phase shift is achieved by a fractional Fourier transform realized by a time lens in one of interferometer's arms. We consider application of such a sorter with just two interferometers to sorting the Schmidt modes of a photon pair generated in spontaneous parametric downconversion and find the theoretical lower bond on the cross-talk probability of 5.5%.</description>

      <title>Noise-robust proofs of quantum network nonlocality</title>

Abstract: Quantum networks allow for novel forms of quantum nonlocality. By exploiting the combination of entangled states and entangled measurements, strong nonlocal correlations can be generated across the entire network. So far, all proofs of this effect are essentially restricted to the idealized case of pure entangled states and projective local measurements. Here we present noise-robust proofs of network quantum nonlocality, for a class of quantum distributions on the triangle network that are based on entangled states and entangled measurements. The key ingredient is a result of approximate rigidity for local distributions that satisfy the so-called ``parity token counting'' property with high probability. Our methods can be applied to any type of noise. As illustrative examples, we consider quantum distributions obtained with imperfect sources and obtain a noise robustness up to $\sim 80\%$ for dephasing noise and up to $\sim 0.5\%$ for white noise. Additionally, we prove that all distributions in the vicinity of some ideal quantum distribution are nonlocal, with a bound on the total-variation distance $\sim 0.25\%$. Our work opens interesting perspectives towards the practical implementation of quantum network nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types, including two novel classes. The first class consists of 1 boundary and is generated by sweeping the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaching it to the $X$-boundary that condenses only magnetic fluxes. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism, and hence contains 'magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second class consists of 70 boundaries and is generated by sweeping the $S$-domain wall across a codimension-1 submanifold and attaching it to the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory, equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes, where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) defects. New boundaries are produced whenever the corresponding symmetry of the SPT defect remains unbroken on the boundary. Applications of the magic boundaries include implementing fault-tolerant non-Clifford logical gates, e.g., in the context of fractal topological codes.</description>

      <title>Classical Commitments to Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the notion of a classical commitment scheme to quantum states, which allows a quantum prover to compute a classical commitment to a quantum state, and later open each qubit of the state in either the standard or the Hadamard basis. Our notion is a strengthening of the measurement protocol from Mahadev (STOC 2018). We construct such a commitment scheme from the post-quantum Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption, and more generally from any noisy trapdoor claw-free function family that has the distributional strong adaptive hardcore bit property (a property that we define in this work).
  Our scheme is succinct in the sense that the running time of the verifier in the commitment phase depends only on the security parameter (independent of the size of the committed state), and its running time in the opening phase grows only with the number of qubits that are being opened (and the security parameter). As a corollary we obtain a classical succinct argument system for QMA under the post-quantum LWE assumption. Previously, this was only known assuming post-quantum secure indistinguishability obfuscation. As an additional corollary we obtain a generic way of converting any X/Z quantum PCP into a succinct argument system under the quantum hardness of LWE.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits capable of recovering quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. These are applicable to both entanglement-assisted and non-assisted settings. By developing a technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the decoders, we show that they are applicable to any noise model. As a consequence, for any noisy channel, our decoders can be used to achieve a communication rate arbitrarily close to the quantum capacity by increasing the number of channel uses. To construct the decoders, we employ the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise. Our constructions offer advantages in the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previous explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Implementation and topological characterization of Weyl exceptional rings in quantum-mechanical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity can lead to the emergence of many intriguing phenomena that are absent in Hermitian systems, enabled by exceptional topological defects, among which Weyl exceptional rings (WER) are particularly interesting. The topology of a WER can be characterized by the quantized Berry phase and a nonzero Chern number, both encoded in the eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. So far, WERs have been realized with classical wave systems, whose eigenvectors can be well described by classical physics. We here report the first quantum-mechanical implementation of WERs and investigate the related topology transitions. The experiment system consists of a superconducting qubit and a dissipative resonator, coupled to each other. The high flexibility of the system enables us to characterize its eigenvectors on different manifolds of parameter space, each of which corresponds to a quantum-mechanical entangled state. We extract both the quantized Berry phase and Chern number from these eigenvectors, and demonstrate the topological transition triggered by shrinking the size of the manifold.</description>

Abstract: The quantum description of the microscopic world is incompatible with the classical description of the macroscopic world, both mathematically and conceptually. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in the macroscopic limit. In this letter, we challenge this perspective and demonstrate that the behavior of a macroscopic system can retain all aspects of the quantum formalism, in a way that is robust against decoherence, particle losses and coarse-grained (imprecise) measurements. This departure from the expected classical description of macroscopic systems is not merely mathematical but also conceptual, as we show by the explicit violation of a Bell inequality and a Leggett-Garg inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous variable quantum computing platform constitutes a promising candidate for realizing quantum advantage, as exemplified in Gaussian Boson Sampling. While noise in the experiments makes the computation attainable for classical simulations, it has been suggested that the addition of non-linear elements to the experiment will help retain the quantum advantage. We propose a classical simulation tool for general continuous variable sampling problems, including Gaussian Boson Sampling and beyond. We reformulate the sampling problem as that of finding the ground state of a simple few-body Hamiltonian. This allows us to employ powerful variational methods based on tensor networks and to read off the simulation error directly from the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. We validate our method by simulating Gaussian Boson Sampling, where we achieve results comparable to the state of the art. We also consider a non-Gaussian sampling problem, for which we develop novel local basis optimization techniques based on a non-linear parameterization of the implicit basis, resulting in high effective cutoffs with diminished computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Quantum Benchmarking of High-Fidelity Noise-Biased Operations on a Detuned-Kerr-Cat Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ubiquitous noises in quantum systems remain a key obstacle to building quantum computers, necessitating the use of quantum error correction codes. Recently, error-correcting codes tailored for noise-biased systems have been shown to offer high fault-tolerance thresholds and reduced hardware overhead, positioning noise-biased qubits as promising candidates for building universal quantum computers. However, quantum operations on these platforms remain challenging, and their noise structures have not yet been rigorously benchmarked to the same extent as those of conventional quantum hardware. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum control toolbox for a scalable noise-biased qubit, detuned Kerr-cat qubit, including initialization, universal single-qubit gates and quantum non-demolition readout. We systematically characterize the noise structure of these operations using gate set tomography and dihedral randomized benchmarking, achieving high local gate fidelities, with $\mathcal{F}[Z(\pi/2)]=99.2\%$ and $\mathcal{F}[X(\pi/2)]=92.5\%$. Notably, the noise bias of the detuned Kerr-cat qubit approaches 250, which outperforms its resonant-Kerr-cat qubit counterparts as reported previously, representing a new state-of-the-art performance benchmark for noise-biased qubits. Moreover, our results reveal a critical overestimation of operational noise bias inferred from bit-flip and phase-flip times alone, highlighting the necessity of a precise and direct benchmarking for noise-biased qubit operations. Our work thus establishes a framework for systematically characterizing and validating the performance of quantum operations in structured-noise architectures, which lays the groundwork for implementing efficient quantum error correction in next-generation architectures.</description>

      <title>Noisy Cyclic Quantum Random Walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore static noise in a discrete quantum random walk over a homogeneous cyclic graph, focusing on spectral and dynamical properties. Using a three-parameter unitary coin, we control the spectral structure of the noiseless step operator on the unit circle. One parameter induces two spectral bands separated by a gap proportional to its value, while the half-sum of the two phase parameters rotates the spectrum and enables twofold degeneracy under specific conditions. Degenerate spectra yield sinusoidal probability distributions; non-degenerate ones produce flat profiles. We introduce static phase noise on the sites and analyze its effects in two propagation regimes. In the walk-on-the-line regime, preceding a full graph traversal, we extract the spreading exponent $\beta$ from the step-resolved mean squared displacement. Low participation ratios correlate with sub-diffusive spread; high ratios indicate ballistic or super-diffusive evolution. Once the walker completes a cycle, finite-size effects dominate. In this walk-on-the-cycle regime, $\beta$ no longer characterizes the dynamics. Instead, we quantify localization using the coefficient of variation of the mean squared displacement. In both regimes, we observe a sharp crossover near static site noise $\phi_s = \pi/3$, marked by a drop in participation ratio, a transition from diffusive to sub-diffusive spread in the walk-on-the-line regime, and a reduced saturation level in the walk-on-the-cycle regime. Our results show that the eigenstate participation ratio is an efficient spectral diagnostic that anticipates localization across both regimes, offering an alternative to full dynamical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulators have the potential to solve quantum many-body problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers, especially when they feature long-range entanglement. To fulfill their prospects, quantum simulators must be fully controllable, allowing for precise tuning of the microscopic physical parameters that define their implementation. We consider Rydberg-atom arrays, a promising platform for quantum simulations. Experimental control of such arrays is limited by the imprecision on the optical tweezers positions when assembling the array, hence introducing uncertainties in the simulated Hamiltonian. In this work, we introduce a scalable approach to Hamiltonian learning using graph neural networks (GNNs). We employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to generate ground-state snapshots of the transverse field Ising model realized by the array, for many realizations of the Hamiltonian parameters. Correlation functions reconstructed from these snapshots serve as input data to carry out the training. We demonstrate that our GNN model has a remarkable capacity to extrapolate beyond its training domain, both regarding the size and the shape of the system, yielding an accurate determination of the Hamiltonian parameters with a minimal set of measurements. We prove a theorem establishing a bijective correspondence between the correlation functions and the interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian, which provides a theoretical foundation to our learning algorithm. Our work could open the road to feedback control of the positions of the optical tweezers, hence providing a decisive improvement of analog quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the applications of secure multiparty computation as a privacy-protecting data analysis tool, and identifying oblivious transfer as one of its main practical enablers, we propose a practical realization of randomized quantum oblivious transfer. By using only symmetric cryptography primitives to implement commitments, we construct computationally-secure randomized oblivious transfer without the need for public-key cryptography or assumptions imposing limitations on the adversarial devices. We show that the protocol is secure under an indistinguishability-based notion of security and demonstrate an experimental implementation to test its real-world performance. Its security and performance are then compared to both quantum and classical alternatives, showing potential advantages over existing solutions based on the noisy storage model and public-key cryptography.</description>

Abstract: The calculation of the natural lineshape of an excited two-level atom (TLA) has long been known to be gauge-dependent, with certain experiments in better agreement with the lineshape calculated with the dipole gauge. We show that by using a Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian truncated in a manner consistent with the gauge principle, the correct output spectrum can be obtained. For TLAs undergoing dynamics arising from additional Hamiltonian couplings, we also show that the master equation is gauge-invariant under the same conditions of validity as the Born-Markov approximation, despite different gauges having different spectral densities. These results highlight the importance of using correctly truncated gauge-invariant Hamiltonians in input-output theory for accurate frequency-dependent spectra, even in weak coupling regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We describe cat-qubit-inspired bias-preserving $X$ and $CX$ gates for fluxonium. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness in the unitary and monitored quantum dynamics of XXZ-staggered and SYK models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the XXZ-staggered spin chain, also focusing on its noninteracting XX-staggered limit, and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and private information in many-body thermal states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use concepts from quantum cryptography to relate the entanglement in many-body mixed states to standard correlation functions. If a system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment -- we can infer that the state of the system is entangled. For thermal states, we derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Non-Classical Systems: A Large Deviation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any quasi-probability representation of a no-signaling system -- including quantum systems -- can be simulated via a purely classical scheme by allowing signed events and a cancellation procedure. This raises a fundamental question: What properties of the non-classical system does such a classical simulation fail to replicate? We answer by using large deviation theory to show that the probability of a large fluctuation under the classical simulation can be strictly greater than under the actual non-classical system. The key finding driving our result is that negativity in probability relaxes the data processing inequality of information theory. We propose this potential large deviation stability of quantum (and no-signaling) systems as a novel form of quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wigner functions help visualise quantum states and dynamics while supporting quantitative analysis in quantum information. In the discrete setting, many inequivalent constructions coexist for each Hilbert-space dimension. This fragmentation obscures which features are fundamental and which are artefacts of representation. We introduce a stencil-based framework that exhausts all possible $d\times d$ discrete Wigner functions for a single $d$-dimensional quantum system (including a novel one for even $d$), subsuming known forms. We also give explicit invertible linear maps between definitions within the same $d$, enabling direct comparison of operational properties and exposing representation dependence.</description>

      <title>Integration of a high-fidelity model of quantum sensors with a map-matching filter for quantum-enhanced navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing the potential of quantum sensors to assist in navigation requires enabling their operation in complex, dynamic environments and integrating them within existing navigation systems. While cross-couplings from platform dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data. In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that could support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond navigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to current research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters, gradiometers and inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>Qudit Noisy Stabilizer Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the qudit Noisy Stabilizer Formalism, a framework for efficiently describing the evolution of stabilizer states in prime-power dimensions subject to generalized Pauli-diagonal noise under Clifford operations and generalized Pauli measurements. For arbitrary dimensions, the formalism remains applicable, though restricted to a subset of stabilizer states and operations. The computational complexity scales linearly with the number of qudits in the initial state and exponentially with the number of qudits in the final state. This ensures that when noisy qudit stabilizer states evolve via generalized Pauli measurements and Clifford operations to generate multipartite entangled states of a few qudits, their description remains efficient. We demonstrate this by analyzing the generation of a generalized Bell pair from a noisy linear cluster state subject to two distinct noise sources acting on each of the qudits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework of topological complexity to study the computational complexity of quantum circuits and tensor networks. Within this framework, we establish the Quon Classical Simulation (QCS) for hybrid Clifford-Matchgate circuits, which is efficient for both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits, therefore answering a long standing open question on unifying efficient classical simulations. This framework is built upon the Quon language, a 2+1D topological quantum field theory with space-time boundary and defects. Its exponential computation complexity is captured by Magic holes, a topological feature capturing the global long-range entanglement. Both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of Magic holes. Efficient classical simulations of Cliffords and Matchgates are implemented by two parallel operations, generalized surgery theory of 3-manifolds and Yang-Baxter relations on the 2D boundary respectively, with additional binary arithmetic properties.</description>

      <title>Ultracoherent superconducting cavity-based multiqudit platform with error-resilient control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with an estimated coherence-limited fidelities of 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</description>

      <title>Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the validity of the quantum equivalence principle, this approach provides insights not only into the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime itself exhibits quantum properties. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</description>

Abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and provides a lower bound on the evolution time. The attainability of QSL, greatly depending on the understanding of QSL, is a long-standing open problem especially for high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we solve this problem by establishing a QSL suitable and attainable for both open and closed quantum systems based on a new proposed state distance. It is shown that given any initial state in a certain dimension, our QSL bound can always be saturated by unitary and non-unitary dynamics, and for any given Hamiltonian for a unitary evolution, a pair of states always exists, saturating the bound. As applications, we demonstrate the QSL time attained by various physical settings. This paper will shed new light on the QSL problems.</description>

      <title>A Modular PyTheus Quantum Network Interpreter: Automated Analysis and Visualization of Optimized Quantum Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modular interpreter for PyTheus-optimized quantum networks that automatically analyzes and visualizes complex quantum architectures discovered through automated optimization. The interpreter addresses the critical challenge of understanding machine-designed quantum networks by providing robust algorithms for functional role identification, graph-theoretical analysis, and physically meaningful visualization across the major classes of PyTheus-generated networks. Our interpreter accepts both file-based and in-memory network representations, automatically identifies sources, detectors, beam splitters, and ancillas through priority-based classification, and generates coordinated native graph plots and optical table representations. We demonstrate the interpreter's capabilities through two complementary approaches: (1) analysis of a newly developed five-node quantum key distribution network that reveals distributed source architecture and dual-role node functionality, and (2) comprehensive validation using existing PyTheus examples including W4 state generation, heralded Bell state preparation, and GHZ state networks. The interpreter successfully handles complex connectivity patterns across diverse quantum network architectures within the tested classes, avoids visualization artifacts, and provides validation mechanisms for architectural consistency. Our primary contribution is the development of robust modular interpretation algorithms that can analyze the major classes of PyTheus-generated quantum networks, enabling better understanding of automated quantum architecture design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work, we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition, that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming 100% fidelity on different classes of states.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Noise and Crosstalk in Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores and evaluates noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum computers. Neutral atom quantum computers are a promising platform for analog Hamiltonian simulations, which rely on a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians to model the dynamics of a larger system and are particularly useful for problems in optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics. However, the viability of running multiple simulations in a co-located or multi-tenant environment is limited by noise and crosstalk. This work conducts an analysis of how noise faced by simulations changes over time, and investigates the effects of spatial co-location on simulation fidelity. Findings of this work demonstrate that the close proximity of concurrent simulations can increase crosstalk between them. To mitigate this issue, a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy is proposed and evaluated. The results confirm that the MTD is a viable technique for enabling safe and reliable co-location of simulations on neutral atom quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Quantum Phase Estimation: A Modular, Scalable, and Adaptive Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum computing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum chemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which require a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant challenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE) algorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE. AWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m &gt; 1$ control qubits to estimate multiple phase bits simultaneously within a "window,'' thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision. These independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined with a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB) ambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while mitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate AWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource efficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited for near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate qubit dynamics under PT and Anti-PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, focusing on phase evolution, decoherence, quantum speed limits (QSL), and R\'enyi entanglement entropies. Using similarity transformations and Dyson maps, we analyze the reduced density matrix evolution in bosonic environments. Anti-PT-symmetric systems show enhanced robustness against decoherence, with slower entropy growth and longer coherence times compared to PT-symmetric counterparts. QSL behavior is non-monotonic, reflecting rapid initial evolution followed by a gradual decrease. Higher-order R\'enyi entropies reveal that Anti-PT-symmetric qubits preserve quantum information more effectively, offering advantages for memory and cryptographic applications.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry packaging is the phenomenon whereby, upon particle creation, all the internal quantum numbers (IQNs) become locked into a single irreducible representation (irrep) block of the gauge group, as required by locality and gauge invariance. The resulting packaged quantum states exhibit characteristic symmetry constraints and entanglement patterns. We develop a group-theoretic framework to describe the symmetry packaging for a variety of concrete symmetries and to classify the corresponding packaged states: \textbf{(1)} We prove that for any finite or compact group $G$, there exist $G$-associated packaged subspaces, in which every vector is automatically a packaged state. In particular, in multi-particle systems, any nontrivial representation of $G$ induces inseparable packaged entanglement that locks together all IQNs. \textbf{(2)} We apply this framework to symmetry packaging in finite groups (cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_N$, charge conjugation $C$, fermion parity, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and dihedral groups), compact groups ($\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(N)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$), $p$-form symmetries, and hybrid symmetries. In each case, gauge invariance and superselection rules forbid the factorization of the resulting states. We illustrate how Bell-type packaged entangled states, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations all arise naturally. These results yield a complete classification of packaged quantum states. \textbf{(3)} Finally, we extend the packaging principle to incorporate full spacetime symmetry and hybrid systems of local, global, and Lorentz/Poincar\'e charges. Our approach unifies tools from group theory, gauge theory, and topological classification. These results may be useful for potential applications in high energy physics, quantum field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling for trapped-ion thermometry using dark resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of vibrational energy transport and quantum thermodynamics with trapped ions requires good methods for the estimation of temperatures. One valuable tool for this purpose is based on the fit of dark resonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, this fit demands numerical simulations of the coupled electronic-motional dynamics which usually involve a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified dynamical equations for the simulation of the spectrum of a trapped ion that undergoes thermal motion, identifying the advantages and limitations of each method. We start with a three-level model to provide a better insight into the approximations involved, and then move on to tackle the experimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that mimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is computationally very convenient, but can lead to significant errors in the estimation of the temperature. Nevertheless, this can be counteracted by a proper calibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing, due to their promise of intrinsically low error rates enabled by topological protection. These error rates are expected to be suppressed exponentially with increasing nanowire length or decreasing temperature. Here we identify a fundamental decoherence mechanism that challenges this expectation. The high-frequency components of 1/f charge noise, ubiquitous in semiconductor devices, can excite quasiparticles in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which travel to the ends of the nanowire to poison the MZMs. This mechanism leads to qubit errors that grow with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the excitation rates for clean nanowires and show that this noise imposes a strict limit on the coherence times of the qubits currently being developed, reducing them to less than one microsecond even under ideal conditions. These timescales are significantly shorter than those required for gate operations, posing a serious obstacle to the scalability of Majorana-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The Baby Universe is Fine and the CFT Knows It: On Holography for Closed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Quantum Skyrmion Qudit in a Triangular-lattice magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum-impurity sensing of altermagnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response, a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local, noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.</description>
