      <title>Achieving collimated gamma-ray emission from direct laser acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons in a laser-irradiated plasma can produce distinct photon emission profiles, focusing on the mechanisms responsible for single-lobed versus double-lobed angular distributions of emitted \(\gamma\)-rays. Through a combination of particle-in-cell simulations, test-electron simulations, and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the efficiency of DLA is a key determinant of the resulting emission pattern. Our results show that inefficient DLA, characterized by electrons rapidly gaining and losing energy within a single laser cycle, leads to a double-lobed emission profile heavily influenced by laser fields. In contrast, in the efficient DLA regime, where electrons steadily accumulate energy over multiple cycles, the emission is primarily governed by the quasi-static azimuthal magnetic fields generated by the laser in the plasma, resulting in a well-collimated single-lobed emission profile. Additionally, we identify that reducing the electron density in the target enhances the efficiency of DLA, thereby transforming the emission from a double-lobed to a single-lobed profile. These findings provide valuable insights into the optimization of laser-driven \(\gamma\)-ray sources for applications requiring high-intensity, well-collimated beams.</description>

      <title>Large radiation back-flux from Monte Carlo simulations of fusion neutron-material interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation back-fluxes, generated from neutron-material interactions in fusion power reactors, can dramatically impact the plasma dynamics, e.g., by seeding runaway electrons during disruptions via Compton scattering of background electrons by wall-emitted gamma radiation. Here, we quantify these back-fluxes, including neutrons, gamma rays, and electrons, using Monte Carlo calculations for a range of structural material candidates and first wall thicknesses. The radiation back-flux magnitudes are remarkably large, with neutron and gamma radiation back-fluxes on the same order of magnitude as the incident fusion neutron flux. Electron back-fluxes are two orders of magnitudes lower, but are emitted at sufficiently high energies to provide a relatively large back-current through the sheath which may cause sheath reversal. Material configuration plays a key role in determining back-flux magnitudes. The structural material chiefly determines the neutron back-flux magnitude, while the first wall thickness principally attenuates the gamma ray and electron back-fluxes. In addition to prompt back-fluxes, which are emitted immediately after fusion neutrons impact the surface, significant delayed gamma ray and electron back-fluxes arise from nuclear decay processes in the activated materials. These delayed back-flux magnitudes range from 2%--7% of the prompt back-fluxes, and remain present during transients when fusion no longer occurs. During disruptions, build-up of delayed gamma radiation back-flux represents potential runaway electron seeding mechanisms, posing additional challenges for disruption mitigation in a power reactor compared with non-nuclear plasma operations. This work highlights the impact of these radiation back-fluxes plasma performance and demonstrates the importance of considering back-flux generation in materials selection for fusion power reactors.</description>

      <title>Analytical calculation of the kinetic q factor and resonant response of toroidally confined plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking perturbations in axisymmetric toroidal plasma configurations have a drastic impact on particle, energy, and momentum transport in fusion devices, thereby affecting their confinement properties. The perturbative modes strongly affect particles with specific kinetic characteristics through resonant mode-particle interactions. In this work we present an analytical calculation of the kinetic q factor enabling the identification of particles with kinetic properties that meet the resonant conditions. This allows us to predict the locations and structures of the corresponding resonant island-chains, as well as the existence of transport barriers in the particle phase space. The analytical results, derived for the case of a large aspect ratio configuration, are systematically compared to numerical simulations, and their domain of validity is thoroughly investigated and explained. Our findings demonstrate that calculating the kinetic q factor and its dependence on both particle and magnetic field characteristics, provides a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the resonant plasma response to non-axisymmetric perturbations. Moreover, this approach can be semi-analytically applied to generic realistic experimental equilibria, offering a low-computational-cost method for scenario investigations under various multiscale perturbative modes.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Out-of-Plane Flow Shear on Magnetic Reconnection at the Flanks of Earth's Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection changes the magnetic field topology and facilitates the energy and particle exchange at magnetospheric boundaries such as the Earth's magnetopause. The flow shear perpendicular to the reconnecting plane prevails at the flank magnetopause under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. However, the effect of the out-of-plane flow shear on asymmetric reconnection is an open question. In this study, we utilize kinetic simulations to investigate the impact of the out-of-plane flow shear on asymmetric reconnection. By systematically varying the flow shear strength, we analyze the flow shear effects on the reconnection rate, the diffusion region structure, and the energy conversion rate. We find that the reconnection rate increases with the upstream out-of-plane flow shear, and for the same upstream conditions, it is higher at the dusk side than at the dawn side. The diffusion region is squeezed in the outflow direction due to magnetic pressure which is proportional to the square of the Alfv\'en Mach number of the shear flow. The out-of-plane flow shear increases the energy conversion rate J \cdot E', and for the same upstream conditions, the magnitude of J \cdot E' is larger at the dusk side than at the dawn side. This study reveals that out-of-plane flow shear not only enhances the reconnection rate but also significantly boosts energy conversion, with more pronounced effects on the dusk-side flank than on the dawn-side flank. These insights pave the way for better understanding the solar wind-magnetosphere interactions.</description>

      <title>How to describe the Sweet-Parker model in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a hot topic nowadays that magnetic reconnection, as a physical process to release magnetic energy effectively, occurs in numerous complicated astrophysical systems. Since the magnetic reconnection is thought to occur frequently in the accretion flow around compact objects which induce strong gravitational field, it is now regarded to be a practical mechanism to extract energy from rotation black holes, which motivates people to consider how to describe the process of magnetic reconnection in a generally relativistic way. In this work, I try to explore the description of Sweet-Parker model, one of the most famous theoretical models of magnetic reconnection, in general relativity. I begin with revisiting the Sweet-Parker model in special relativity and reorganize the calculations in seven steps, whose generally relativistic forms are discussed. I propose in this work, from the general discussions and consequences of specific examples, that no property in Sweet-Parker model would be modified by spacetime curvature, which is opposite to the conclusions in previous work. However, on the contrary, observation in different rest frames may bring modifications. If the magnetic reconnection occurs not in the rest frame of observer, the observer would find out that the detected relation between the reconnection rate and Lundquist number or that between outflow speed and Alfven velocity are not the same as the detected relations if the magnetic reconnection occurs just in the rest frame of observer.</description>
