      <title>High Performance Simulation of Spaceborne Radar for Remote-Sensing Oceanography: Application to an Altimetry Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail the high-performance implementation of our spaceborne radar simulator for satellite oceanography. Our software simulates the sea surface and the signal to imitate, as far as possible, the measurement process, starting from its lowest level mechanisms. In this perspective, raw data are computed as the sum of many illuminated scatterers, whose time-evolving properties are related to the surface roughness, topography, and kinematics. To achieve efficient performance, we intensively use GPU computing. Moreover, we propose a fast simulation mode based on the assumption that the instantaneous Doppler spectrum within a range gate varies on a timescale significantly larger than the PRI. The sea surface can then be updated at a frequency much smaller than the PRF, drastically reducing the computational cost. When the surface is updated, Doppler spectra are computed for all range gates. Signals segments are then obtained through 1D inverse Fourier transforms and pondered to ensure a smooth time evolution between surface updates. We validate this fast simulation mode with a radar altimeter simulation case of the Sentinel-3 SRAL instrument, showing that simulated raw data can be focused and retrieved using state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we show that, using a modest hardware configuration, our simulator can generate enough data in one day to compute the SWH and SSH spectra of a scene. This demonstrate that we achieved an important state-of-the-art speed-up.</description>

      <title>A short introduction to Neural Networks and their application to Earth and Materials Science Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are gaining widespread relevance for their versatility, holding the promise to yield a significant methodological shift in different domain of applied research. Here, we provide a simple pedagogical account of the basic functioning of a feedforward neural network. Then we move forward to reviewing two recent applications of machine learning to Earth and Materials Science. We will in particular begin by discussing a neural network based geothermobarometer, which returns reliable predictions of the pressure/temperature conditions of magma storage. Further, we will turn to illustrate how machine learning tools, tested on the list of minerals from the International Mineralogical Association, can help in the search for novel superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Twist, turn and encounter: the trajectories of small atmospheric particles unravelled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every solid particle in the atmosphere, from ice crystals and pollen to dust, ash, and microplastics, is non-spherical. These particles play significant roles in Earth's climate system, influencing temperature, weather patterns, natural ecosystems, human health, and pollution levels. However, our understanding of these particles is largely based on the theories for extremely small particles and experiments conducted in liquid mediums. In this study, we used an innovative experimental setup and particle-resolved numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of sub-millimetre ellipsoids of varying shapes in the air. Our results revealed complex decaying oscillation patterns involving numerous twists and turns in these particles, starkly contrasting their dynamics in liquid mediums. We found that the frequency and decay rate of these oscillations have a strong dependence on the particle shape. Interestingly, disk-shaped particles oscillated at nearly twice the frequency of rod-shaped particles, though their oscillations also decayed more rapidly. During oscillation, even subtly non-spherical particles can drift laterally up to ten times their volume-equivalent spherical diameter. This behaviour enables particles to sweep through four times more air both vertically and laterally compared to a volume-equivalent sphere, significantly increasing their encounter rate and aggregation possibility. Our findings provide an explanation for the long-range transport and naturally occurring aggregate formation of highly non-spherical particles such as snowflakes and volcanic ash.</description>
