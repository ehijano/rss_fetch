      <title>Optimising the decision threshold in a weighted voting system: The case of the IMF's Board of Governors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a weighted majority voting game, the players' weights are determined based on the decision-maker's intentions. The weights are challenging to change in numerous cases, as they represent some desired disparity. However, the voting weights and the actual voting power do not necessarily coincide. Changing a decision threshold would offer some remedy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is one of the most important international organisations that uses a weighted voting system to make decisions. The voting weights in its Board of Governors depend on the quotas of the 191 member countries, which reflect their economic strengths to some extent. We analyse the connection between the decision threshold and the a priori voting power of the countries by calculating the Banzhaf indices for each threshold between 50% and 87\%. The difference between the quotas and voting powers is minimised if the decision threshold is 58% or 60%.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the value of investment in research facilities, with examples from cyberinfrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: How much to invest in research facilities has long been a question in higher education and research policy. We present established and recently developed techniques for assessing the quantitative value created or received as a result of investments in research facilities. This discussion is timely. Financial challenges in higher education may soon force difficult decisions regarding investment in research facilities at some institutions. Clear quantitative analysis will be necessary for such strategic decision-making. Further, institutions of higher education in the USA are currently being called on to justify their value to society. The analyses presented here are extendable to research enterprises as a whole. Results: We present methods developed primarily for analyses of cyberinfrastructure. Most analyses comparing investment in university-based cyberinfrastructure facilities with purchasing services from commercial sources demonstrate positive results for economic and scientific research. A recent assessment, based on a comprehensive accounting approach, has shown that for one large publicly funded cyberinfrastructure project the value delivered to the USA economy and society exceeded the cost to USA taxpayers. Conclusions: Quantitative analyses of the benefits of investment in research and research facilities create a fact-based foundation for discussing the value of research and higher education. These methods enable a quantitative assessment of the relationship between investment in specific research facilities or research projects and economic, societal, and educational outcomes. These methods are of value in quantifying the economic benefit of higher education and in managing investments within such institutions.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in representing subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>
