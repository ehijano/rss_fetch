      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps.</description>

      <title>An atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer-based acceleration sensor for microgravity environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of an atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) with a pulsed non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) source as a space-based acceleration sensor. We derive an analytic approximation for the device's transmission under a uniform acceleration, which we use to compute the device's attainable acceleration sensitivity using the classical Fisher information. In the ideal case of a high-finesse FPI and an infinitely narrow momentum width atomic source, we find that when the total length of the device is constrained to small values, the atomic FPI can achieve greater acceleration sensitivity than a Mach-Zender (MZ) interferometer of equivalent total device length. Under the more realistic case of a finite momentum width atomic source, We identify the ideal cavity length that gives the best sensitivity. Although the MZ interferometer now offers enhanced sensitivity within currently-achievable experimental parameter regimes, our analysis demonstrates that the atomic FPI holds potential as a promising alternative in the future, provided that narrow momentum width atomic sources can be engineered.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and electron-correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for group 12 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report a detailed calculation of the static dipole polarizabilities for group 12 elements using the finite-field approach combined with the relativistic coupled-cluster method, including single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. We examine three types of relativistic effects on dipole polarizabilities: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb contributions. The final recommended polarizability values, with their associated uncertainties, are $37.95 \pm 0.72$ for Zn, $45.68 \pm 1.16$ for Cd, $34.04 \pm 0.67$ for Hg, and $27.92 \pm 0.24$ for Cn. Our results align closely with the recommended values in the 2018 Table of static dipole polarizabilities for neutral atoms [Mol. Phys. \textbf{117}, 1200 (2019)], while providing reduced uncertainties for Cd and Cn. The analysis indicates that scalar-relativistic effects are the dominant relativistic contributions to atomic dipole polarizabilities for these atoms, with SOC effects found to be negligible. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of electron correlation across all relativistic regimes, underscoring its critical role in the precise determination of dipole polarizabilities.</description>

      <title>Second-order hyperfine correction to H, D, and $^3$He energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete second-order hyperfine-interaction correction is calculated for centroid energy levels of H, D, and $^3$He atoms. For $^3$He, the corrections of $-2.075$ kHz and $-0.305$ kHz beyond the leading hyperfine-mixing contribution are obtained for the $2^1S$ and $2^3S$ states, respectively. These results shift the nuclear charge radii difference derived from the $^3$He - $^4$He isotope shift and largely resolve the previously reported disagreement between the muonic and electronic helium determinations [Y. van der Werf et al., arXiv:2306.02333 (2023); K. Schuhmann et al., arXiv:2305.11679 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Quadratic Zeeman and Electric Quadrupole Shifts in Highly Charged Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in high-precision spectroscopy of highly charged ions necessitate an understanding of energy shifts of ionic levels caused by external electric and magnetic fields. Beyond the well-known Stark and linear Zeeman shifts, trapped ions may also exhibit quadratic Zeeman and electric quadrupole shifts. In this contribution, we present a systematic approach for the theoretical analysis of these shifts for arbitrary many-electron ions. Based on the derived expressions and making use of the multiconfigurational Dirac-Fock approach, we performed calculations of quadratic Zeeman shift coefficients and quadrupole moments for various ionic states in Ca$^{14+}$, Ni$^{12+}$ and Xe$^{q+}$ ions. These ions attract particular interest for ongoing and future experiments in optical clocks and tests of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Long-term stable laser injection locking for quasi-CW applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high output powers while achieving narrow line single mode lasing are often mutual exclusive properties of commercial laser diodes. For this reason, efficient and scalable amplification of narrow line laser light is still a major driving point in modern laser system designs. Commonly, injection locking of high-power semiconductor laser diodes are used for this purpose. However, for many laser diodes it is very challenging to achieve stable operation of the injection locked state due to a complex interplay of non-linearities and thermal effects. Different approaches of active or passive stabilization usually require a large overhead of optical and electrical equipment and are not generally applicable. In our work we present a passive stabilization scheme, that is generally applicable, technically easy to implement and extremely cost-effective. It is based on the externally synchronized automatic acquisition of the optimal injection state. Central to our simple but powerful scheme is the management of thermalization effects during lock acquisition. By periodical relocking, spectrally pure amplified light is maintained in a quasi-CW manner over long timescales. We characterize the performance of our method for laser diodes amplifying 671 nm light and demonstrate the general applicability by confirming the method to work also for laser diodes at 401 nm, 461 nm and 689 nm. Our scheme enables the scaled operation of injection locks, even in cascaded setups, for the distributed amplification of single frequency laser light.</description>

      <title>Highly spin-polarized molecules via collisional microwave pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general technique to produce cold spin-polarized molecules, in which rotationally excited states are first populated by coherent microwave excitation, and then allowed to spin-flip and relax via collisional quenching, which populates a single final spin state. We illustrate the high selectivity of the technique for $^{13}$C$^{16}$O molecules immersed in a cold buffer gas of helium atoms, achieving a high degree ($\geq$95\%) of nuclear spin polarization at 1 K.</description>

      <title>Role of momentum in the generator-coordinate method applied to barrier penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>
