      <title>Parable of the Parabola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study triangles and quadrilaterals which are inscribed in a circle and circumscribed about a parabola. Although these are particular cases of the celebrated Poncelet's Theorem, in this paper we {\it do not assume} the theorem but prove it along the way. Similarly, our arguments here \emph{are logically independent} from Cayley's condition, describing points of a finite order on an elliptic curve or any other use of the theory of elliptic curves. Instead, we use purely planimetric methods, including the Joachimsthal notation, to fully describe such polygons and associated circles and parabolas. We prove that a circle contains the focus of a parabola if and only if there is a triangle inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola. We prove that if the center of a circle coincides with the focus of a parabola, then there exists a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola. We further prove that the quadrilaterals obtained in such a way are antiparallelograms. If the center of a circle does not coincide with the focus of a parabola, then a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola exists if and only if the directrix of the parabola contains the point of intersection of the polar of the focus with respect to the circle with the line determined by the center and the focus. That point coincides with the intersection of the diagonals of any quadrilateral inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola. In particular, for a given circle and a confocal pencil of parabolas with the focus different than the center of the circle, there is a unique parabola for which there exists a quadrilateral circumscribed about it and inscribed in the circle.</description>

      <title>Who cares about mathematics education?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, teaching and outreach have come to hold an expected place in more missions of mathematics departments and organizations. Still, there is more to do as a mathematical sciences community for mathematics education and mathematics educators to be fully included. This essay, published in the AWM Newsletter, demonstrates the prevalence of mathematics education in mathematics departments, and then discusses the variously supportive and unsupportive climates that mathematics educators experience in mathematics departments. The essay describes fractious, fragile, and fertile environments in mathematics departments.</description>
